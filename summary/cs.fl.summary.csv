summary
"The well known open \v{C}ern\'y conjecture states that each \san with $n$
states has a \sw of length at most $(n-1)^2$. On the other hand, the best known
upper bound is cubic of $n$. Recently, in the paper \cite{CARPI1} of Alessandro
and Carpi, the authors introduced the new notion of strongly transitivity for
automata and conjectured that this property with a help of \emph{Extension}
method allows to get a quadratic upper bound for the length of the shortest
\sws. They also confirmed this conjecture for circular automata. We disprove
this conjecture and the long-standing \emph{Extension} conjecture too. We also
consider the widely used Extension method and its perspectives."
"Circular splicing systems are a formal model of a generative mechanism of
circular words, inspired by a recombinant behaviour of circular DNA. Some
unanswered questions are related to the computational power of such systems,
and finding a characterization of the class of circular languages generated by
circular splicing systems is still an open problem. In this paper we solve this
problem for complete systems, which are special finite circular splicing
systems. We show that a circular language L is generated by a complete system
if and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary
language generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation. The class of
pure unitary languages was introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht, D. Haussler, G.
Rozenberg in 1983, as a subclass of the class of context-free languages,
together with a characterization of regular pure unitary languages by means of
a decidable property. As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular)
circular languages generated by complete systems. We can also decide whether
the language generated by a complete system is regular. Finally, we point out
that complete systems have the same computational power as finite simple
systems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature
from the very beginning, when only one rule is allowed. From our results on
complete systems, it follows that finite simple systems generate a class of
context-free languages containing non-regular languages, showing the
incorrectness of a longstanding result on simple systems."
"A language L is prefix-closed if, whenever a word w is in L, then every
prefix of w is also in L. We define suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed
languages in the same way, where by subword we mean subsequence. We study the
quotient complexity (usually called state complexity) of operations on prefix-,
suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages. We find tight upper bounds on
the complexity of the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-closure of
arbitrary languages, and on the complexity of boolean operations,
concatenation, star and reversal in each of the four classes of closed
languages. We show that repeated application of positive closure and complement
to a closed language results in at most four distinct languages, while Kleene
closure and complement gives at most eight languages."
"Visibly pushdown transducers form a subclass of pushdown transducers that
(strictly) extends finite state transducers with a stack. Like visibly pushdown
automata, the input symbols determine the stack operations. In this paper, we
prove that functionality is decidable in PSpace for visibly pushdown
transducers. The proof is done via a pumping argument: if a word with two
outputs has a sufficiently large nesting depth, there exists a nested word with
two outputs whose nesting depth is strictly smaller. The proof uses technics of
word combinatorics. As a consequence of decidability of functionality, we also
show that equivalence of functional visibly pushdown transducers is
Exptime-Complete."
"An algebraic linear ordering is a component of the initial solution of a
first-order recursion scheme over the continuous categorical algebra of
countable linear orderings equipped with the sum operation and the constant 1.
Due to a general Mezei-Wright type result, algebraic linear orderings are
exactly those isomorphic to the linear ordering of the leaves of an algebraic
tree. Using Courcelle's characterization of algebraic trees, we obtain the fact
that a linear ordering is algebraic if and only if it can be represented as the
lexicographic ordering of a deterministic context-free language. When the
algebraic linear ordering is a well-ordering, its order type is an algebraic
ordinal. We prove that the Hausdorff rank of any scattered algebraic linear
ordering is less than $\omega^\omega$. It follows that the algebraic ordinals
are exactly those less than $\omega^{\omega^\omega}$."
"Let S be a finite set of words over an alphabet Sigma. The set S is said to
be complete if every word w over the alphabet Sigma is a factor of some element
of S*, i.e. w belongs to Fact(S*). Otherwise if S is not complete, we are
interested in finding bounds on the minimal length of words in Sigma* which are
not elements of Fact(S*) in terms of the maximal length of words in S."
"We propose an algorithm that test membership for regular expressions and show
that the algorithm is correct. This algorithm is written in the style of a
sequent proof system. The advantage of this algorithm over traditional ones is
that the complex conversion process from regular expressions to finite automata
is not needed. As a consequence, our algorithm is simple and extends easily to
various extensions to regular expressions such as timed regular expressions or
regular languages with the intersection."
"This paper illustrates a technique for specifying the detailed timing,
logical operation, and compositional circuit design of digital circuits in
terms of ordinary state machines with output (transducers). The method is
illustrated here with specifications of gates, latches, and other simple
circuits and via the construction of devices starting with a SR latch built
from gates and then moving on to more complex devices. Circuit timing and
transients are treated in some detail. The method is based on ""classical""
automata and recursive functions on strings. No formal methods, extended state
machines, or process algebras are involved but a reference is made to potential
applications of the Krohn-Rhodes theorem and other group/monoid based algebraic
techniques."
"We study one-head machines through symbolic and topological dynamics. In
particular, a subshift is associated to the subshift, and we are interested in
its complexity in terms of realtime recognition. We emphasize the class of
one-head machines whose subshift can be recognized by a deterministic pushdown
automaton. We prove that this class corresponds to particular restrictions on
the head movement, and to equicontinuity in associated dynamical systems."
"We consider Parikh images of languages accepted by non-deterministic finite
automata and context-free grammars; in other words, we treat the languages in a
commutative way --- we do not care about the order of letters in the accepted
word, but rather how many times each one of them appears. In most cases we
assume that the alphabet is of fixed size. We show tight complexity bounds for
problems like membership, equivalence, and disjointness. In particular, we show
polynomial algorithms for membership and disjointness for Parikh images of
non-deterministic finite automata over fixed alphabet, and we show that
equivalence is Pi2P complete for context-free grammars over fixed terminal
alphabet."
"Simulations of weighted tree automata (wta) are considered. It is shown how
such simulations can be decomposed into simpler functional and dual functional
simulations also called forward and backward simulations. In addition, it is
shown in several cases (fields, commutative rings, Noetherian semirings,
semiring of natural numbers) that all equivalent wta M and N can be joined by a
finite chain of simulations. More precisely, in all mentioned cases there
exists a single wta that simulates both M and N. Those results immediately
yield decidability of equivalence provided that the semiring is finitely (and
effectively) presented."
"We prove the following theorem. Suppose that $M$ is a trim DFA on the Boolean
alphabet $0,1$. The language $\L(M)$ is well-ordered by the lexicographic order
$\slex$ iff whenever the non sink states $q,q.0$ are in the same strong
component, then $q.1$ is a sink. It is easy to see that this property is
sufficient. In order to show the necessity, we analyze the behavior of a
$\slex$-descending sequence of words. This property is used to obtain a
polynomial time algorithm to determine, given a DFA $M$, whether $\L(M)$ is
well-ordered by the lexicographic order. Last, we apply an argument in
\cite{BE,BEa} to give a proof that the least nonregular ordinal is
$\omega^\omega $."
"In this paper, we show a construction of a weakly universal cellular
automaton in the 3D hyperbolic space with two states. The cellular automaton is
rotation invariant and, moreover, based on a new implementation of a railway
circuit in the dodecagrid,the construction is a truly 3D-one."
"In an attempt to classify all of the overlap-free morphisms constructively
using the Latin-square morphism, we came across an interesting counterexample,
the Leech square-free morphism. We generalize the combinatorial properties of
the Leech square-free morphism to gain insights on a larger class of both
overlap-free morphisms and square-free morphisms."
"In this paper, following the way opened by a previous paper deposited on
arXiv, we give an upper bound to the number of states for a hyperbolic cellular
automaton in the pentagrid. Indeed, we prove that there is a hyperbolic
cellular automaton which is rotation invariant and whose halting problem is
undecidable and which has 9~states."
"Arguably, omega-regular languages play an important role as a specification
formalism in many approaches to systems monitoring via runtime verification.
However, since their elements are infinite words, not every omega-regular
language can sensibly be monitored at runtime when only a finite prefix of a
word, modelling the observed system behaviour so far, is available. The
monitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds,
if for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite
word v, such that uv becomes a ""finite witness"" wrt. L; that is, for any
infinite word w, we have that uvw \in L, or for any infinite word w, we have
that uvw \not\in L. This notion has been studied in the past by several
authors, and it is known that the class of monitorable languages is strictly
more expressive than, e.g., the commonly used class of so-called safety
languages. But an exact categorisation of monitorable languages has, so far,
been missing. Motivated by the use of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in many
approaches to runtime verification, this paper first determines the complexity
of the monitorability problem when L is given by an LTL formula. Further, it
then shows that this result, in fact, transfers to omega-regular languages in
general, i.e., whether they are given by an LTL formula, a nondeterministic
Buechi automaton, or even by an omega-regular expression."
"In this paper, we study the state complexities of union and intersection
combined with star and reversal, respectively. We obtain the state complexities
of these combined operations on regular languages and show that they are less
than the mathematical composition of the state complexities of their individual
participating operations."
"Parikh's theorem states that the Parikh image of a context-free language is
semilinear or, equivalently, that every context-free language has the same
Parikh image as some regular language. We present a very simple construction
that, given a context-free grammar, produces a finite automaton recognizing
such a regular language."
"We investigate Abelian primitive words, which are words that are not Abelian
powers. We show that unlike classical primitive words, the set of Abelian
primitive words is not context-free. We can determine whether a word is Abelian
primitive in linear time. Also different from classical primitive words, we
find that a word may have more than one Abelian root. We also consider
enumeration problems and the relation to the theory of codes."
"In this paper, we show that, due to the structural properties of the
resulting automaton obtained from a prior operation, the state complexity of a
combined operation may not be equal but close to the mathematical composition
of the state complexities of its component operations. In particular, we
provide two witness combined operations: reversal combined with catenation and
star combined with catenation."
"In this paper we extend the work on \emph{dynamic ob\-servers} for fault
diagnosis to timed automata. We study sensor minimization problems with static
observers and then address the problem of computing the most permissive dynamic
observer for a system given by a timed automaton."
"A language L is prefix-free if, whenever words u and v are in L and u is a
prefix of v, then u=v. Suffix-, factor-, and subword-free languages are defined
similarly, where ""subword"" means ""subsequence"". A language is bifix-free if it
is both prefix- and suffix-free. We study the quotient complexity, more
commonly known as state complexity, of operations in the classes of bifix-,
factor-, and subword-free regular languages. We find tight upper bounds on the
quotient complexity of intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference,
concatenation, star, and reversal in these three classes of languages."
"We study time-bounded reachability in continuous-time Markov decision
processes for time-abstract scheduler classes. Such reachability problems play
a paramount role in dependability analysis and the modelling of manufacturing
and queueing systems. Consequently, their analysis has been studied
intensively, and techniques for the approximation of optimal control are well
understood. From a mathematical point of view, however, the question of
approximation is secondary compared to the fundamental question whether or not
optimal control exists.
  We demonstrate the existence of optimal schedulers for the time-abstract
scheduler classes for all CTMDPs. Our proof is constructive: We show how to
compute optimal time-abstract strategies with finite memory. It turns out that
these optimal schedulers have an amazingly simple structure - they converge to
an easy-to-compute memoryless scheduling policy after a finite number of steps.
  Finally, we show that our argument can easily be lifted to Markov games: We
show that both players have a likewise simple optimal strategy in these more
general structures."
"Regular expressions (res), because of their succinctness and clear syntax,
are the common choice to represent regular languages. However, efficient
pattern matching or word recognition depend on the size of the equivalent
nondeterministic finite automata (NFA). We present the implementation of
several algorithms for constructing small epsilon-free NFAss from res within
the FAdo system, and a comparison of regular expression measures and NFA sizes
based on experimental results obtained from uniform random generated res. For
this analysis, nonredundant res and reduced res in star normal form were
considered."
"We consider rational power series over an alphabet $\Sigma$ with coefficients
in a ordered commutative semiring $K$ and characterize them as the free ordered
$K$-semialgebras in various classes of ordered $K$-semialgebras equipped with a
star operation satisfying the least pre-fixed point rule and/or its dual. The
results are generalizations of Kozen's axiomatization of regular languages."
"We introduce a new technique for constructing a finite state deterministic
automaton from a regular expression, based on the idea of marking a suitable
set of positions inside the expression, intuitively representing the possible
points reached after the processing of an initial prefix of the input string.
Pointed regular expressions join the elegance and the symbolic appealingness of
Brzozowski's derivatives, with the effectiveness of McNaughton and Yamada's
labelling technique, essentially combining the best of the two approaches."
"The state complexity of a regular language is the number of states in the
minimal deterministic automaton accepting the language. The syntactic
complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup.
The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case
syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of
languages in that class. We study the syntactic complexity of the class of
regular ideal languages and their complements, the closed languages. We prove
that $n^{n-1}$ is a tight upper bound on the complexity of right ideals and
prefix-closed languages, and that there exist left ideals and suffix-closed
languages of syntactic complexity $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and two-sided ideals and
factor-closed languages of syntactic complexity $n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$."
"The (bounded) hairpin completion and its iterated versions are operations on
formal lan- guages which have been inspired by the hairpin formation in
DNA-biochemistry. The paper answers two questions asked in the literature about
the iterated hairpin completion.
  The first question is whether the class of regular languages is closed under
iterated bounded hairpin completion. Here we show that this is true by
providing a more general result which applies to all the classes of languages
which are closed under finite union, intersection with regular sets, and
concatenation with regular sets. In particular, all Chomsky classes and all
standard complexity classes are closed under iterated bounded hairpin
completion.
  In the second part of the paper we address the question whether the iterated
hairpin completion of a singleton is always regular. In contrast to the first
question, this one has a negative answer. We exhibit an example of a singleton
language whose iterated hairpin completion is not regular, actually it is not
context-free, but context-sensitive."
"The main aim of the paper is to give a short self-contained proof of the
decidability of language equivalence for deterministic pushdown automata, which
is the famous problem solved by G. Senizergues, for which C. Stirling has
derived a primitive recursive complexity upper bound. The proof here is given
in the framework of first-order grammars, which seems to be particularly apt
for the aim. An appendix presents a modification of Stirling's approach,
yielding a complexity bound of the form tetr(2,g(n)) where tetr is the
(nonelementary) operator of iterated exponentiation (tetration) and g is an
elementary function of the input size."
"This chapter is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms for
minimizing finite automata. Getting a minimal automaton is a fundamental issue
in the use and implementation of finite automata tools in frameworks like text
processing, image analysis, linguistic computer science, and many other
applications. There are two main families of minimization algorithms. The first
by a sequence of refinements of a partition of the set of states, the second by
a sequence of fusions or merges of states. Hopcroft's and Moore's algorithms
belong to the first family, the linear-time minimization of acyclic automata of
Revuz belongs to the second family.
  One of our studies is upon the comparison of the nature of Moore's and
Hopcroft's algorithms. This gives some new insight in both algorithms. As we
shall see, these algorithms are quite different both in behavior and in
complexity. In particular, we show that it is not possible to simulate the
computations of one of the algorithm by the other. We describe the minimization
algorithm by fusion for so-called local automata. A special case of
minimization is the construction o minimal automata for finite sets. We
consider briefly this case, and in particular describe incremental algorithms.
Finally, we consider the case of updating a minimal automaton when a word is
added or removed from the set it recognizes."
"We prove that the subsets of N^d that are S-recognizable for all abstract
numeration systems S are exactly the 1-recognizable sets. This generalizes a
result of Lecomte and Rigo in the one-dimensional setting."
"In this paper we define an infinite family of triangular tilings of the
hyperbolic plane defined by two parameters ranging in the natural nummbers and
we give a uniform way to define coordinates for locating the triangles of the
tiling."
"The Parikh finite word automaton (PA) was introduced and studied by Klaedtke
and Ruess in 2003. Natural variants of the PA arise from viewing a PA
equivalently as an automaton that keeps a count of its transitions and
semilinearly constrains their numbers. Here we adopt this view and define the
affine PA (APA), that extends the PA by having each transition induce an affine
transformation on the PA registers, and the PA on letters (LPA), that restricts
the PA by forcing any two transitions on same letter to affect the registers
equally. Then we report on the expressiveness, closure, and decidability
properties of such PA variants. We note that deterministic PA are strictly
weaker than deterministic reversal-bounded counter machines. We develop
pumping-style lemmas and identify an explicit PA language recognized by no
deterministic PA."
"We present a study on lookahead hierarchies for restarting automata with
auxiliary symbols and small lookahead. In particular, we show that there are
just two different classes of languages recognised RRWW automata, through the
restriction of lookahead size. We also show that the respective (left-)
monotone restarting automaton models characterise the context-free languages
and that the respective right-left-monotone restarting automata characterise
the linear languages both with just lookahead length 2."
"We consider a set of natural operations on languages, and prove that the
orbit of any language L under the monoid generated by this set is finite and
bounded, independently of L. This generalizes previous results about
complement, Kleene closure, and positive closure."
"The class of omega-regular languages provides a robust specification language
in verification. Every omega-regular condition can be decomposed into a safety
part and a liveness part. The liveness part ensures that something good happens
""eventually"". Finitary liveness was proposed by Alur and Henzinger as a
stronger formulation of liveness. It requires that there exists an unknown,
fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. In this
work we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined by
finitary Buchi, parity and Streett languages. We study languages expressible by
such automata: we give their topological complexity and present a
regular-expression characterization. We compare the expressive power of
finitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisions
questions. We show that the finitary languages are Sigma 2-complete; we present
a complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata with
finitary and infinitary acceptance conditions; we show that the languages
defined by finitary parity automata exactly characterize the star-free fragment
of omega B-regular languages; and we show that emptiness is NLOGSPACE-complete
and universality as well as language inclusion are PSPACE-complete for finitary
parity and Streett automata."
"We develop a general framework for the specification and implementation of
systems whose executions are words, or partial orders, over an infinite
alphabet. As a model of an implementation, we introduce class register
automata, a one-way automata model over words with multiple data values. Our
model combines register automata and class memory automata. It has natural
interpretations. In particular, it captures communicating automata with an
unbounded number of processes, whose semantics can be described as a set of
(dynamic) message sequence charts. On the specification side, we provide a
local existential monadic second-order logic that does not impose any
restriction on the number of variables. We study the realizability problem and
show that every formula from that logic can be effectively, and in elementary
time, translated into an equivalent class register automaton."
"A finite set S of words over the alphabet A is called non-complete if
Fact(S*) is different from A*. A word w in A* - Fact(S*) is said to be
uncompletable. We present a series of non-complete sets S_k whose minimal
uncompletable words have length 5k^2 - 17k + 13, where k > 3 is the maximal
length of words in S_k. This is an infinite series of counterexamples to
Restivo's conjecture, which states that any non-complete set possesses an
uncompletable word of length at most 2k^2."
"Hairpin completion is an abstract operation modeling a DNA bio-operation
which receives as input a DNA strand $w = x\alpha y \calpha$, and outputs $w' =
x \alpha y \bar{\alpha} \bar{x}$, where $\bar{x}$ denotes the Watson-Crick
complement of $x$. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding conditions
under which the iterated hairpin completion of a given word is regular.
According to the numbers of words $\alpha$ and $\calpha$ that initiate hairpin
completion and how they are scattered, we classify the set of all words $w$.
For some basic classes of words $w$ containing small numbers of occurrences of
$\alpha$ and $\calpha$, we prove that the iterated hairpin completion of $w$ is
regular. For other classes with higher numbers of occurrences of $\alpha$ and
$\calpha$, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the iterated
hairpin completion of a word in these classes to be regular."
"Minimal deterministic finite automata (DFAs) can be reduced further at the
expense of a finite number of errors. Recently, such minimization algorithms
have been improved to run in time O(n log n), where n is the number of states
of the input DFA, by [Gawrychowski and Je\.z: Hyper-minimisation made
efficient. Proc. MFCS, LNCS 5734, 2009] and [Holzer and Maletti: An n log n
algorithm for hyper-minimizing a (minimized) deterministic automaton. Theor.
Comput. Sci. 411, 2010]. Both algorithms return a DFA that is as small as
possible, while only committing a finite number of errors. These algorithms are
further improved to return a DFA that commits the least number of errors at the
expense of an increased (quadratic) run-time. This solves an open problem of
[Badr, Geffert, and Shipman: Hyper-minimizing minimized deterministic finite
state automata. RAIRO Theor. Inf. Appl. 43, 2009]. In addition, an experimental
study on random automata is performed and the effects of the existing
algorithms and the new algorithm are reported."
"This short note aims at proving that the isolation problem is undecidable for
probabilistic automata with only one probabilistic transition. This problem is
known to be undecidable for general probabilistic automata, without restriction
on the number of probabilistic transitions. In this note, we develop a
simulation technique that allows to simulate any probabilistic automaton with
one having only one probabilistic transition."
"Business Process Compliance (BPC) has gained significant momentum in research
and practice during the last years. Although many approaches address BPC, they
mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified base of process constraints
and focus on their verification over the business processes. However, it
remains unclear how such an inte- grated process constraint base can be built
up, even though this con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further
compliance checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
the success- ful IT support of BPC will not be possible. In this technical
report we introduce a unified representation framework that enables the
identifica- tion of process constraints from domain rules and their later
unification within a process constraint base. Separating process constraints
from domain rules can lead to significant reduction of compliance checking
effort. Unification enables consistency checks and optimizations as well as
maintenance and evolution of the constraint base on the other side."
"In the algebraic theory of codes and formal languages, the set $Q$ of all
primitive words over some alphabet $\zi $ has received special interest. With
this survey article we give an overview about relevant research to this topic
during the last twenty years including own investigations and some new results.
In Section 1 after recalling the most important notions from formal language
theory we illustrate the connection between coding theory and primitive words
by some facts. We define primitive words as words having only a trivial
representation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the
empty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of
an uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former
one. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of
the language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties
which we consider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship
between the set $Q$ of all primitive words over some fixed alphabet and the
language classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the
same alphabet. The computational complexity of the set $Q$ and of the roots of
languages are considered in Section 4. The set of all powers of the same degree
of all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the
powers of languages for different sets of exponents, and especially their
regularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of
appropriate questions in Section 6. Section 7 is dedicated to several
generalizations of the notions of periodicity and primitivity of words."
"Finite state machines are widely used as a sound mathematical formalism that
appropriately describes large scale, distributed and complex systems. Multiple
interactions of finite state machines in complex systems are well captured by
the notion of non-flat systems. Non--flat systems are ""finite state machines""
where each ""state"" can be either a basic state or an aggregate of finite state
machines. By expanding a non-flat system, a flat system is obtained which is an
ordinary finite state machine. In this paper we introduce a novel class of
non--flat systems called Arena of Finite State Machines (AFSM). AFSMs are
collections of finite state machines that interact concurrently through a
communication network. We propose a notion of compositional bisimulation that
allows checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs by directly exploiting their
communication networks and hence, without the need of expanding the AFSMs to
finite state machines. Compositional bisimulation allows a computational
complexity reduction when checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs, as
formally quantified in the paper. An application of the proposed framework to
the regulation of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli is also
presented."
"Data automata on data words is a decidable model proposed by Boja\'nczyk et
al. in 2006. Class automata, introduced recently by Boja\'nczyk and Lasota, is
an extension of data automata which unifies different automata models on data
words. The nonemptiness of class automata is undecidable, since class automata
can simulate two-counter machines. In this paper, a decidable model called
class automata with priority class condition, which restricts class automata
but strictly extends data automata, is proposed. The decidability of this model
is obtained by establishing a correspondence with priority multicounter
automata. This correspondence also completes the picture of the links between
various class conditions of class automata and various models of counter
machines. Moreover, this model is applied to extend a decidability result of
Alur, Cern\'y and Weinstein on the algorithmic analysis of array-accessing
programs."
"We consider various shuffling and unshuffling operations on languages and
words, and examine their closure properties. Although the main goal is to
provide some good and novel exercises and examples for undergraduate formal
language theory classes, we also provide some new results and some open
problems."
"This paper proposes a way to effectively compare the potential of processes
to cause conflict. In discrete event systems theory, two concurrent systems are
said to be in conflict if they can get trapped in a situation where they are
both waiting or running endlessly, forever unable to complete their common
task. The conflict preorder is a process-algebraic pre-congruence that compares
two processes based on their possible conflicts in combination with other
processes. This paper improves on previous theoretical descriptions of the
conflict preorder by introducing less conflicting pairs as a concrete
state-based characterisation. Based on this characterisation, an effective
algorithm is presented to determine whether two processes are related according
to the conflict preorder."
"The hairpin completion is an operation on formal languages that has been
inspired by the hairpin formation in DNA biochemistry and by DNA computing. In
this paper we investigate the hairpin completion of regular languages.
  It is well known that hairpin completions of regular languages are linear
context-free and not necessarily regular. As regularity of a (linear)
context-free language is not decidable, the question arose whether regularity
of a hairpin completion of regular languages is decidable. We prove that this
problem is decidable and we provide a polynomial time algorithm.
  Furthermore, we prove that the hairpin completion of regular languages is an
unambiguous linear context-free language and, as such, it has an effectively
computable growth function. Moreover, we show that the growth of the hairpin
completion is exponential if and only if the growth of the underlying languages
is exponential and, in case the hairpin completion is regular, then the hairpin
completion and the underlying languages have the same growth indicator."
"Mateescu, Salomaa, and Yu asked: is it decidable whether a given subword
history assumes only non-negative values for all words over a given alphabet.
In this paper, we solve this open problem by proving that this problem is
undecidable even under stronger conditions than supposed originally."
"WORDS is the main international event in Combinatorics on Words. It is a
biannual conference devoted to research of words (i.e., finite or infinite
sequences of symbols over a finite alphabet) from combinatorial, algebraic and
algorithmic points of view. The emphasis of the conference is on mathematical
theory of words but the conference is also open to applications, mainly in
computer science, biology, linguistics and physics, gaining from the fact that
words arise as a natural object in many areas.
  The eighth edition of the conference was organized in Prague from 12th to
16th September 2011 as a joint undertaking of the Czech Technical University
and the Charles University. This volume consists of contributed papers accepted
for presentation at the conference and summaries of invited lectures."
"I am going to compare well-known properties of infinite words with those of
infinite permutations, a new object studied since middle 2000s. Basically, it
was Sergey Avgustinovich who invented this notion, although in an early study
by Davis et al. permutations appear in a very similar framework as early as in
1977. I am going to tell about periodicity of permutations, their complexity
according to several definitions and their automatic properties, that is, about
usual parameters of words, now extended to permutations and behaving sometimes
similarly to those for words, sometimes not. Another series of results concerns
permutations generated by infinite words and their properties. Although this
direction of research is young, many people, including two other speakers of
this meeting, have participated in it, and I believe that several more topics
for further study are really promising."
"Classically in combinatorics on words one studies unavoidable regularities
that appear in sufficiently long strings of symbols over a fixed size alphabet.
In this paper we take another viewpoint and focus on combinatorial properties
of long words in which the number of occurrences of any symbol is restritced by
a fixed constant. We then demonstrate the connection of these properties to
constructing multicollision attacks on so called generalized iterated hash
functions."
"The Parikh finite word automaton model (PA) was introduced and studied by
Klaedtke and Ruess in 2003. Here, by means of related models, it is shown that
the bounded languages recognized by PA are the same as those recognized by
deterministic PA. Moreover, this class of languages is the class of bounded
languages whose set of iterations is semilinear."
"A classical result (often credited to Y. Medvedev) states that every language
recognized by a finite automaton is the homomorphic image of a local language,
over a much larger so-called local alphabet, namely the alphabet of the edges
of the transition graph. Local languages are characterized by the value k=2 of
the sliding window width in the McNaughton and Papert's infinite hierarchy of
strictly locally testable languages (k-slt). We generalize Medvedev's result in
a new direction, studying the relationship between the width and the alphabetic
ratio telling how much larger the local alphabet is. We prove that every
regular language is the image of a k-slt language on an alphabet of doubled
size, where the width logarithmically depends on the automaton size, and we
exhibit regular languages for which any smaller alphabetic ratio is
insufficient. More generally, we express the trade-off between alphabetic ratio
and width as a mathematical relation derived from a careful encoding of the
states. At last we mention some directions for theoretical development and
application."
"The recently confirmed Dejean's conjecture about the threshold between
avoidable and unavoidable powers of words gave rise to interesting and
challenging problems on the structure and growth of threshold words. Over any
finite alphabet with k >= 5 letters, Pansiot words avoiding 3-repetitions form
a regular language, which is a rather small superset of the set of all
threshold words. Using cylindric and 2-dimensional words, we prove that, as k
approaches infinity, the growth rates of complexity for these regular languages
tend to the growth rate of complexity of some ternary 2-dimensional language.
The numerical estimate of this growth rate is about 1.2421."
"We study the structure of the language of binary cube-free words. Namely, we
are interested in the cube-free words that cannot be infinitely extended
preserving cube-freeness. We show the existence of such words with arbitrarily
long finite extensions, both to one side and to both sides."
"We develop new polynomial methods for studying systems of word equations. We
use them to improve some earlier results and to analyze how sizes of systems of
word equations satisfying certain independence properties depend on the lengths
of the equations. These methods give the first nontrivial upper bounds for the
sizes of the systems."
"The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its
syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular
languages is the maximal syntactic complexity of languages in that subclass,
taken as a function of the state complexity of these languages. We study the
syntactic complexity of star-free regular languages, that is, languages that
can be constructed from finite languages using union, complement and
concatenation. We find tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexity of
languages accepted by monotonic and partially monotonic automata. We introduce
""nearly monotonic"" automata, which accept star-free languages, and find a tight
upper bound on the syntactic complexity of languages accepted by such automata.
We conjecture that this bound is also an upper bound on the syntactic
complexity of star-free languages."
"A regular tree language L is locally testable if membership of a tree in L
depends only on the presence or absence of some fix set of neighborhoods in the
tree. In this paper we show that it is decidable whether a regular tree
language is locally testable. The decidability is shown for ranked trees and
for unranked unordered trees."
"We consider the master/slave parameterised reachability problem for networks
of pushdown systems, where communication is via a global store using only
non-atomic reads and writes. We show that the control-state reachability
problem is decidable. As part of the result, we provide a constructive
extension of a theorem by Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg to produce an NFA
equivalent to certain kinds of CFG. Finally, we show that the non-parameterised
version is undecidable."
"Iterated hairpin completion is an operation on formal languages that is
inspired by the hairpin formation in DNA biochemistry. Iterated hairpin
completion of a word (or more precisely a singleton language) is always a
context-sensitive language and for some words it is known to be
non-context-free. However, it is unknown whether regularity of iterated hairpin
completion of a given word is decidable. Also the question whether iterated
hairpin completion of a word can be context-free but not regular was asked in
literature. In this paper we investigate iterated hairpin completions of
non-crossing words and, within this setting, we are able to answer both
questions. For non-crossing words we prove that the regularity of iterated
hairpin completions is decidable and that if iterated hairpin completion of a
non-crossing word is not regular, then it is not context-free either."
"Regular expressions provide a flexible means for matching strings and they
are often used in data-intensive applications. They are formally equivalent to
either deterministic finite automata (DFAs) or nondeterministic finite automata
(NFAs). Both DFAs and NFAs are affected by two problems known as amnesia and
acalculia, and DFAs are also affected by a problem known as insomnia. Existing
techniques require an automata conversion and compaction step that prevents the
use of existing automaton databases and hinders the maintenance of the
resulting compact automata. In this paper, we propose Parallel Finite State
Machines (PFSMs), which are able to run any DFA- or NFA-like state machines
without a previous conversion or compaction step. PFSMs report, online, all the
matches found within an input string and they solve the three aforementioned
problems. Parallel Finite State Machines require quadratic time and linear
memory and they are distributable. Parallel Finite State Machines make very
fast distributed regular expression matching in data-intensive applications
feasible."
"In this paper, a compressed membership problem for finite automata, both
deterministic and non-deterministic, with compressed transition labels is
studied. The compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e.
context-free grammars generating exactly one string. A novel technique of
dealing with SLPs is introduced: the SLPs are recompressed, so that substrings
of the input text are encoded in SLPs labelling the transitions of the NFA
(DFA) in the same way, as in the SLP representing the input text. To this end,
the SLPs are locally decompressed and then recompressed in a uniform way.
Furthermore, such recompression induces only small changes in the automaton, in
particular, the size of the automaton remains polynomial.
  Using this technique it is shown that the compressed membership for NFA with
compressed labels is in NP, thus confirming the conjecture of Plandowski and
Rytter and extending the partial result of Lohrey and Mathissen; as it is
already known, that this problem is NP-hard, we settle its exact computational
complexity. Moreover, the same technique applied to the compressed membership
for DFA with compressed labels yields that this problem is in P; for this
problem, only trivial upper-bound PSPACE was known."
"Answering a recent question of Crochemore, we prove that the language of
words that are not abelian squares is not context-free."
"We compare tools for complementing nondeterministic B\""uchi automata with a
recent termination-analysis algorithm. Complementation of B\""uchi automata is a
key step in program verification. Early constructions using a Ramsey-based
argument have been supplanted by rank-based constructions with exponentially
better bounds. In 2001 Lee et al. presented the size-change termination (SCT)
problem, along with both a reduction to B\""uchi automata and a Ramsey-based
algorithm. The Ramsey-based algorithm was presented as a more practical
alternative to the automata-theoretic approach, but strongly resembles the
initial complementation constructions for B\""uchi automata. We prove that the
SCT algorithm is a specialized realization of the Ramsey-based complementation
construction. To do so, we extend the Ramsey-based complementation construction
to provide a containment-testing algorithm. Surprisingly, empirical analysis
suggests that despite the massive gap in worst-case complexity, Ramsey-based
approaches are superior over the domain of SCT problems. Upon further analysis
we discover an interesting property of the problem space that both explains
this result and provides a chance to improve rank-based tools. With these
improvements, we show that theoretical gains in efficiency of the rank-based
approach are mirrored in empirical performance."
"The commutative ambiguity of a context-free grammar G assigns to each Parikh
vector v the number of distinct leftmost derivations yielding a word with
Parikh vector v. Based on the results on the generalization of Newton's method
to omega-continuous semirings, we show how to approximate the commutative
ambiguity by means of rational formal power series, and give a lower bound on
the convergence speed of these approximations. From the latter result we deduce
that the commutative ambiguity itself is rational modulo the generalized
idempotence identity k=k+1 (for k some positive integer), and, subsequently,
that it can be represented as a weighted sum of linear sets. This extends
Parikh's well-known result that the commutative image of context-free languages
is semilinear (k=1).
  Based on the well-known relationship between context-free grammars and
algebraic systems over semirings, our results extend the work by Green et al.
on the computation of the provenance of Datalog queries over commutative
omega-continuous semirings."
"Cross-bifix-free sets are sets of words such that no prefix of any word is a
suffix of any other word. In this paper, we introduce a general constructive
method for the sets of cross-bifix-free binary words of fixed length. It
enables us to determine a cross-bifix-free words subset which has the property
to be non-expandable."
"Linguistic variables represent crisp information in a form and precision
appropriate for the problem. For example, to answer the question ""How are you?""
one may say ""I am fine."" the linguistic variables like ""fine"", so common in
everyday speech. In this paper an alternative interpretation of linguistic
variables is introduced with the notion of a linguistic description of a value
or set of values. The use of linguistic variables in many applications reduces
the overall computation complexity of the application. Linguistic variables
have been shown to be particularly useful in complex non-linear applications.
Here we are applying the concept of reasoning with Linguistic Quantifiers to
define the Linguistic Finite Automata along with the expansion of \delta^{\box}
and \lambda^{\box} over \delta and \lambda."
"A filtration of a formal language L by a sequence s maps L to the set of
words formed by taking the letters of words of L indexed only by s. We consider
the languages resulting from filtering by all arithmetic progressions. If L is
regular, it is easy to see that only finitely many distinct languages result.
By contrast, there exist CFL's that give infinitely many distinct languages as
a result. We use our technique to show that the operation diag, which extracts
the diagonal of words of square length arranged in a square array, preserves
regularity but does not preserve context-freeness."
"Using automata-theoretic approach, Giambruno and Restivo have investigated on
the intersection of two finitely generated submonoids of the free monoid over a
finite alphabet. In particular, they have obtained Hanna Neumann property for a
special class of submonoids generated by finite prefix sets. This work
continues their work and provides a sufficient condition for Hanna Neumann
property for the entire class of submonoids generated by finite prefix sets. In
this connection, a general rank formula for the submonoids which are accepted
by semi-flower automata is also obtained."
"Checking two probabilistic automata for equivalence has been shown to be a
key problem for efficiently establishing various behavioural and anonymity
properties of probabilistic systems. In recent experiments a randomised
equivalence test based on polynomial identity testing outperformed
deterministic algorithms. In this paper we show that polynomial identity
testing yields efficient algorithms for various generalisations of the
equivalence problem. First, we provide a randomized NC procedure that also
outputs a counterexample trace in case of inequivalence. Second, we show how to
check for equivalence two probabilistic automata with (cumulative) rewards. Our
algorithm runs in deterministic polynomial time, if the number of reward
counters is fixed. Finally we show that the equivalence problem for
probabilistic visibly pushdown automata is logspace equivalent to the
Arithmetic Circuit Identity Testing problem, which is to decide whether a
polynomial represented by an arithmetic circuit is identically zero."
"Splicing as a binary word/language operation is inspired by the DNA
recombination under the action of restriction enzymes and ligases, and was
first introduced by Tom Head in 1987. Shortly thereafter, it was proven that
the languages generated by (finite) splicing systems form a proper subclass of
the class of regular languages. However, the question of whether or not one can
decide if a given regular language is generated by a splicing system remained
open. In this paper we give a positive answer to this question. Namely, we
prove that, if a language is generated by a splicing system, then it is also
generated by a splicing system whose size is a function of the size of the
syntactic monoid of the input language, and which can be effectively
constructed."
"An atom of a regular language L with n (left) quotients is a non-empty
intersection of uncomplemented or complemented quotients of L, where each of
the n quotients appears in a term of the intersection. The quotient complexity
of L, which is the same as the state complexity of L, is the number of
quotients of L. We prove that, for any language L with quotient complexity n,
the quotient complexity of any atom of L with r complemented quotients has an
upper bound of 2^n-1 if r=0 or r=n, and 1+\sum_{k=1}^{r} \sum_{h=k+1}^{k+n-r}
C_{h}^{n} \cdot C_{k}^{h} otherwise, where C_j^i is the binomial coefficient.
For each n\ge 1, we exhibit a language whose atoms meet these bounds."
"A formal-linguistic approach for solving an entertaining task is made in this
paper. The well-known task of the Hanoi towers is discussed in relation to some
concepts of discrete mathematics. A context-free grammar which generate an
algorithm for solving this task is described. A deterministic pushdown
automation which in its work imitates the work of monks in solving the task of
the Hanoi towers is built."
"Reaction automata are a formal model that has been introduced to investigate
the computing powers of interactive behaviors of biochemical reactions([14]).
Reaction automata are language acceptors with multiset rewriting mechanism
whose basic frameworks are based on reaction systems introduced in [4]. In this
paper we continue the investigation of reaction automata with a focus on the
formal language theoretic properties of subclasses of reaction automata, called
linearbounded reaction automata (LRAs) and exponentially-bounded reaction
automata (ERAs). Besides LRAs, we newly introduce an extended model (denoted by
lambda-LRAs) by allowing lambda-moves in the accepting process of reaction, and
investigate the closure properties of language classes accepted by both LRAs
and lambda-LRAs. Further, we establish new relationships of language classes
accepted by LRAs and by ERAs with the Chomsky hierarchy. The main results
include the following : (i) the class of languages accepted by lambda-LRAs
forms an AFL with additional closure properties, (ii) any recursively
enumerable language can be expressed as a homomorphic image of a language
accepted by an LRA, (iii) the class of languages accepted by ERAs coincides
with the class of context-sensitive languages."
"A class of languages C is perfect if it is closed under Boolean operations
and the emptiness problem is decidable. Perfect language classes are the basis
for the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if
the language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad
traces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for
CFLs is undecidable, no class containing the CFLs can be perfect.
  In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect
are often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all
behaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a
subset of behaviors is by using bounded languages (languages of the form w1*
... wk* for fixed words w1,...,wk). A class of languages C is perfect modulo
bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every
bounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every
bounded language.
  We consider finding perfect classes of languages modulo bounded languages. We
show that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are
perfect modulo bounded languages, and characterize the complexities of decision
problems. We also show that bounded languages form a maximal class for which
perfection is obtained. We show that computations of several known models of
systems, such as recursive multi-threaded programs, recursive counter machines,
and communicating finite-state machines can be encoded as multi-head pushdown
automata, giving uniform and optimal underapproximation algorithms modulo
bounded languages."
"We present a pumping lemma for each level of the collapsible pushdown graph
hierarchy in analogy to the second author's pumping lemma for higher-order
pushdown graphs (without collapse). Using this lemma, we give the first known
examples that separate the levels of the collapsible pushdown graph hierarchy
and of the collapsible pushdown tree hierarchy, i.e., the hierarchy of trees
generated by higher-order recursion schemes. This confirms the open conjecture
that higher orders allow one to generate more graphs and more trees."
"Quotient is a basic operation of formal languages, which plays a key role in
the construction of minimal deterministic finite automata (DFA) and the
universal automata. In this paper, we extend this operation to formal power
series and systemically investigate its implications in the study of weighted
automata. In particular, we define two quotient operations for formal power
series that coincide when calculated by a word. We term the first operation as
(left or right) \emph{quotient}, and the second as (left or right)
\emph{residual}. To support the definitions of quotients and residuals, the
underlying semiring is restricted to complete semirings or complete
c-semirings. Algebraical properties that are similar to the classical case are
obtained in the formal power series case. Moreover, we show closure properties,
under quotients and residuals, of regular series and weighted context-free
series are similar as in formal languages. Using these operations, we define
for each formal power series $A$ two weighted automata ${\cal M}_A$ and ${\cal
U}_A$. Both weighted automata accepts $A$, and ${\cal M}_A$ is the minimal
deterministic weighted automaton of $A$. The universality of ${\cal U}_A$ is
justified and, in particular, we show that ${\cal M}_A$ is a sub-automaton of
${\cal U}_A$. Last but not least, an effective method to construct the
universal automaton is also presented in this paper."
"We study the syntactic complexity of finite/cofinite, definite and reverse
definite languages. The syntactic complexity of a class of languages is defined
as the maximal size of syntactic semigroups of languages from the class, taken
as a function of the state complexity n of the languages. We prove that (n-1)!
is a tight upper bound for finite/cofinite languages and that it can be reached
only if the alphabet size is greater than or equal to (n-1)!-(n-2)!. We prove
that the bound is also (n-1)! for reverse definite languages, but the minimal
alphabet size is (n-1)!-2(n-2)!. We show that \lfloor e\cdot (n-1)!\rfloor is a
lower bound on the syntactic complexity of definite languages, and conjecture
that this is also an upper bound, and that the alphabet size required to meet
this bound is \floor{e \cdot (n-1)!} - \floor{e \cdot (n-2)!}. We prove the
conjecture for n\le 4."
"In 1964 \v{C}ern\'{y} conjectured that each $n$-state synchronizing automaton
posesses a reset word of length at most $(n-1)^2$. From the other side the best
known upper bound on the reset length (minimum length of reset words) is cubic
in $n$. Thus the main problem here is to prove quadratic (in $n$) upper bounds.
Since 1964, this problem has been solved for few special classes of \sa. One of
this result is due to Kari \cite{Ka03} for automata with Eulerian digraphs. In
this paper we introduce a new approach to prove quadratic upper bounds and
explain it in terms of Markov chains and Perron-Frobenius theories. Using this
approach we obtain a quadratic upper bound for a generalization of Eulerian
automata."
"We resolve an open question by determining matching (asymptotic) upper and
lower bounds on the state complexity of the operation that sends a language L
to (c(L*))*, where c() denotes complement."
"We introduce the class of Interrupt Timed Automata (ITA), a subclass of
hybrid automata well suited to the description of timed multi-task systems with
interruptions in a single processor environment. While the reachability problem
is undecidable for hybrid automata we show that it is decidable for ITA. More
precisely we prove that the untimed language of an ITA is regular, by building
a finite automaton as a generalized class graph. We then establish that the
reachability problem for ITA is in NEXPTIME and in PTIME when the number of
clocks is fixed. To prove the first result, we define a subclass ITA- of ITA,
and show that (1) any ITA can be reduced to a language-equivalent automaton in
ITA- and (2) the reachability problem in this subclass is in NEXPTIME (without
any class graph). In the next step, we investigate the verification of real
time properties over ITA. We prove that model checking SCL, a fragment of a
timed linear time logic, is undecidable. On the other hand, we give model
checking procedures for two fragments of timed branching time logic. We also
compare the expressive power of classical timed automata and ITA and prove that
the corresponding families of accepted languages are incomparable. The result
also holds for languages accepted by controlled real-time automata (CRTA), that
extend timed automata. We finally combine ITA with CRTA, in a model which
encompasses both classes and show that the reachability problem is still
decidable. Additionally we show that the languages of ITA are neither closed
under complementation nor under intersection."
"We show that deterministic finite automata equipped with $k$ two-way heads
are equivalent to deterministic machines with a single two-way input head and
$k-1$ linearly bounded counters if the accepted language is strictly bounded,
i.e., a subset of $a_1^*a_2^*... a_m^*$ for a fixed sequence of symbols $a_1,
a_2,..., a_m$. Then we investigate linear speed-up for counter machines. Lower
and upper time bounds for concrete recognition problems are shown, implying
that in general linear speed-up does not hold for counter machines. For bounded
languages we develop a technique for speeding up computations by any constant
factor at the expense of adding a fixed number of counters."
"The \v{C}ern\'y conjecture (\v{C}ern\'y, 1964) states that each n-state \san\
possess a \sw\ of length $(n-1)^2$. From the other side the best upper bound
for the \rl\ of n-state \sa\ known so far is equal to $\frac{n^3-n}6$ (Pin,
1983) and so is cubic (a slightly better though still cubic upper bound
$\frac{n(7n^2+6n-16)}{48}$ has been claimed in Trahtman but the published proof
of this result contains an unclear place) in $n$. In the paper the \v{C}ern\'y
conjecture is reduced to a simpler conjecture. In particular, we prove
\v{C}ern\'y conjecture for one-cluster automata and quadratic upper bounds for
automata closed to one-cluster automata. Our approach utilize theory of Markov
chains and one simple fact from linear programming."
"We investigate the expressive power of first-order quantifications in the
context of monadic second-order logic over pictures. We show that k+1 set
quantifier alternations allow to define a picture language that cannot be
defined using k set quantifier alternations preceded by arbitrarily many
first-order quantifier alternations. The approach uses, for a given picture
language L and an integer m > 0 the height-m fragment of L, which is defined as
the word language obtained by considering each picture p of height m in L as a
word, where the letters of that word are the columns of p. A key idea is to
measure the complexity of a regular word language by the group complexity of
its syntactic monoid. Given a picture language L, such a word language measure
may be applied to each of its height fragments, so that the complexity of the
picture language is a function that maps each m to the complexity of the
height-m fragment of L. The asymptotic growth rate of that function may be
bounded based on the structure of a monadic second-order formula that defines
L. The core argument for that lower bound proof is based on Straubing's
algebraic characterization of the effect of first-order quantifiers on the
syntactic monoid of word languages by means of Rhodes' and Tilson's block
product."
"The variety DA of finite monoids has a huge number of different
characterizations, ranging from two-variable first-order logic FO^2 to
unambiguous polynomials. In order to study the structure of the subvarieties of
DA, Trotter and Weil considered the intersection of varieties of finite monoids
with bands, i.e., with idempotent monoids. The varieties of idempotent monoids
are very well understood and fully classified. Trotter and Weil showed that for
every band variety V there exists a unique maximal variety W inside DA such
that the intersection with bands yields the given band variety V. These maximal
varieties W define the Trotter-Weil hierarchy. This hierarchy is infinite and
it exhausts DA; induced by band varieties, it naturally has a zigzag shape. In
their paper, Trotter and Weil have shown that the corners and the intersection
levels of this hierarchy are decidable.
  In this paper, we give a single identity of omega-terms for every join level
of the Trotter-Weil hierarchy; this yields decidability. Moreover, we show that
the join levels and the subsequent intersection levels do not coincide. Almeida
and Azevedo have shown that the join of R-trivial and L-trivial finite monoids
is decidable; this is the first non-trivial join level of the Trotter-Weil
hierarchy. We extend this result to the other join levels of the Trotter-Weil
hierarchy. At the end of the paper, we give two applications. First, we show
that the hierarchy of deterministic and codeterministic products is decidable.
And second, we show that the direction alternation depth of unambiguous
interval logic is decidable."
"The join of two varieties is the smallest variety containing both. In finite
semigroup theory, the varieties of R-trivial and L-trivial monoids are two of
the most prominent classes of finite monoids. Their join is known to be
decidable due to a result of Almeida and Azevedo. In this paper, we give a new
proof for Almeida and Azevedo's effective characterization of the join of
R-trivial and L-trivial monoids. This characterization is a single identity of
omega-terms using three variables."
"Cognitive computation such as e.g. language processing, is conventionally
regarded as Turing computation, and Turing machines can be uniquely implemented
as nonlinear dynamical systems using generalized shifts and subsequent G\""odel
encoding of the symbolic repertoire. The resulting nonlinear dynamical automata
(NDA) are piecewise affine-linear maps acting on the unit square that is
partitioned into rectangular domains. Iterating a single point, i.e. a
microstate, by the dynamics yields a trajectory of, in principle, infinitely
many points scattered through phase space. Therefore, the NDAs microstate
dynamics does not necessarily terminate in contrast to its counterpart, the
symbolic dynamics obtained from the rectangular partition. In order to regain
the proper symbolic interpretation, one has to prepare ensembles of randomly
distributed microstates with rectangular supports. Only the resulting
macrostate evolution corresponds then to the original Turing machine
computation. However, the introduction of random initial conditions into a
deterministic dynamics is not really satisfactory. As a possible solution for
this problem we suggest a change of perspective. Instead of looking at point
dynamics in phase space, we consider functional dynamics of probability
distributions functions (p.d.f.s) over phase space. This is generally described
by a Frobenius-Perron integral transformation that can be regarded as a neural
field equation over the unit square as feature space of a dynamic field theory
(DFT). Solving the Frobenius-Perron equation, yields that uniform p.d.f.s with
rectangular support are mapped onto uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support,
again. Thus, the symbolically meaningful NDA macrostate dynamics becomes
represented by iterated function dynamics in DFT; hence we call the resulting
representation dynamic field automata."
"In [1], we introduced the weakly synchronizing languages for probabilistic
automata. In this report, we show that the emptiness problem of weakly
synchronizing languages for probabilistic automata is undecidable. This implies
that the decidability result of [1-3] for the emptiness problem of weakly
synchronizing language is incorrect."
"We study a model of one-way quantum automaton where only measurement
operations are allowed (MOn-1qfa). We give an algebraic characterization of
LMO, showing that the syntactic monoids of the languages in LMO are exactly the
literal pseudovariety of J-trivial literally idempotent monoids, where J is the
Green's relation determined by two-sided ideals. We also prove that LMO
coincides with the literal variety of literally idempotent piecewise testable
regular languages. This allows us to prove the existence of a polynomial time
algorithm for deciding whether a regular language belongs to LMO."
"There is a fundamental difficulty in generalizing weighted automata to the
case of infinite words: in general the infinite sum-of-products from which the
weight of a given word is derived will diverge. Many solutions to this problem
have been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and
employing a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper
we describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the
inevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful
information. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary
semiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives
us information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not
diverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g.,
polynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful
in the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems,
information about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization,
diverge is exactly what we want.
  In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging
automaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and
which employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for
diverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging
power series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by
introducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z
x N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another
Kleene Theorem. We conclude by describing how bidiverging automata are applied
to simulate biinfinite quantum systems."
"Parallel communicating systems of pushdown automata (PCPA) were introduced in
(Csuhaj-Varj{\'u} et. al. 2000) and in their centralized variants shown to be
able to simulate nondeterministic one-way multi-head pushdown automata. A
claimed converse simulation for returning mode (Balan 2009) turned out to be
incomplete (Otto 2012) and a language was suggested for separating these PCPA
of degree two (number of pushdown automata) from nondeterministic one-way
two-head pushdown automata. We show that the suggested language can be accepted
by the latter computational model. We present a different example over a single
letter alphabet indeed ruling out the possibility of a simulation between the
models. The open question about the power of centralized PCPA working in
returning mode is then settled by showing them to be universal. Since the
construction is possible using systems of degree two, this also improves the
previous bound three for generating all recursively enumerable languages.
Finally PCPAs are restricted in such a way that a simulation by multi-head
automata is possible."
"The paper is about a class of languages that extends context-free languages
(CFL) and is stable under shuffle. Specifically, we investigate the class of
partially-commutative context-free languages (PCCFL), where non-terminal
symbols are commutative according to a binary independence relation, very much
like in trace theory. The class has been recently proposed as a robust class
subsuming CFL and commutative CFL. This paper surveys properties of PCCFL. We
identify a natural corresponding automaton model: stateless multi-pushdown
automata. We show stability of the class under natural operations, including
homomorphic images and shuffle. Finally, we relate expressiveness of PCCFL to
two other relevant classes: CFL extended with shuffle and trace-closures of
CFL. Among technical contributions of the paper are pumping lemmas, as an
elegant completion of known pumping properties of regular languages, CFL and
commutative CFL."
"Weighted automata model quantitative aspects of systems like the consumption
of resources during executions. Traditionally, the weights are assumed to form
the algebraic structure of a semiring, but recently also other weight
computations like average have been considered. Here, we investigate
quantitative context-free languages over very general weight structures
incorporating all semirings, average computations, lattices, and more. In our
main result, we derive the fundamental Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger theorem for
such quantitative context-free languages, showing that each arises as the image
of a Dyck language and a regular language under a suitable morphism. Moreover,
we show that quantitative context-free language are expressively equivalent to
a model of weighted pushdown automata. This generalizes results previously
known only for semirings. We also investigate when quantitative context-free
languages assume only finitely many values."
"The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its
syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of the class of
regular languages is the maximal syntactic complexity of languages in that
class, taken as a function of the state complexity n of these languages. We
study the syntactic complexity of R- and J-trivial regular languages, and prove
that n! and floor of [e(n-1)!] are tight upper bounds for these languages,
respectively. We also prove that 2^{n-1} is the tight upper bound on the state
complexity of reversal of J-trivial regular languages."
"Recently, an infinite hierarchy of languages accepted by stateless
deterministic pushdown automata has been established based on the number of
pushdown symbols. However, the witness language for the n-th level of the
hierarchy is over an input alphabet with 2(n-1) elements. In this paper, we
improve this result by showing that a binary alphabet is sufficient to
establish this hierarchy. As a consequence of our construction, we solve the
open problem formulated by Meduna et al. Then we extend these results to
m-state realtime deterministic pushdown automata, for all m at least 1. The
existence of such a hierarchy for m-state deterministic pushdown automata is
left open."
"This paper presents a decidable characterization of tree languages that can
be defined by a boolean combination of Sigma_1 sentences. This is a tree
extension of the Simon theorem, which says that a string language can be
defined by a boolean combination of Sigma_1 sentences if and only if its
syntactic monoid is J-trivial."
"We consider symbolic tree automata (sta) and symbolic tree transducers (stt).
We characterize s-recognizable tree languages (which are the tree languages
recognizable by sta) in terms of (classical) recognizable tree languages and
relabelings. We prove that sta and the recently introduced variable tree
automata are incomparable with respect to their recognition power. We define
symbolic regular tree grammars and characterize s-regular tree languages in
terms of regular tree languages and relabelings. As a consequence, we obtain
that s-recognizable tree languages are the same as s-regular tree languages.
  We show that the syntactic composition of two stt computes the composition of
the tree transformations computed by each stt, provided that (1) the first one
is deterministic or the second one is linear and (2) the first one is total or
the second is nondeleting. We consider forward application and backward
application of stt and prove that the backward application of an stt to any
s-recognizable tree language yields an s-recognizable tree language. We give a
linear stt of which the range is not an s-recognizable tree language. We show
that the forward application of simple and linear stt preserves
s-recognizability. As a corollary, we obtain that the type checking problem of
simple and linear stt and the inverse type checking problem of arbitrary stt is
decidable."
"In this work, it is proved that a set of numbers closed under addition and
whose representations in a rational base numeration system is a rational
language is not a finitely generated additive monoid.
  A key to the proof is the definition of a strong combinatorial property on
languages : the bounded left iteration property. It is both an unnatural
property in usual formal language theory (as it contradicts any kind of pumping
lemma) and an ideal fit to the languages defined through rational base number
systems."
"In data languages the positions of strings and trees carry a label from a
finite alphabet and a data value from an infinite alphabet. Extensions of
automata and logics over finite alphabets have been defined to recognize data
languages, both in the string and tree cases. In this paper we describe and
compare the complexity and expressiveness of such models to understand which
ones are better candidates as regular models."
"Inspired by RNA-editing as occurs in transcriptional processes in the living
cell, we introduce an abstract notion of string adjustment, called guided
rewriting. This formalism allows simultaneously inserting and deleting
elements. We prove that guided rewriting preserves regularity: for every
regular language its closure under guided rewriting is regular too. This
contrasts an earlier abstraction of RNA-editing separating insertion and
deletion for which it was proved that regularity is not preserved. The
particular automaton construction here relies on an auxiliary notion of slice
sequence which enables to sweep from left to right through a completed rewrite
sequence."
"A quite flourishing research thread in the recent literature on
component-based systems is concerned with the algebraic properties of different
classes of connectors. In a recent paper, an algebra of stateless connectors
was presented that consists of five kinds of basic connectors, namely symmetry,
synchronization, mutual exclusion, hiding and inaction, plus their duals, and
it was shown how they can be freely composed in series and in parallel to model
sophisticated 'glues'. In this paper we explore the expressiveness of stateful
connectors obtained by adding one-place buffers or unbounded buffers to the
stateless connectors. The main results are: i) we show how different classes of
connectors exactly correspond to suitable classes of Petri nets equipped with
compositional interfaces, called nets with boundaries; ii) we show that the
difference between strong and weak semantics in stateful connectors is
reflected in the semantics of nets with boundaries by moving from the classic
step semantics (strong case) to a novel banking semantics (weak case), where a
step can be executed by taking some 'debit' tokens to be given back during the
same step; iii) we show that the corresponding bisimilarities are congruences
(w.r.t. composition of connectors in series and in parallel); iv) we show that
suitable monoidality laws, like those arising when representing stateful
connectors in the tile model, can nicely capture concurrency (in the sense of
step semantics) aspects; and v) as a side result, we provide a basic algebra,
with a finite set of symbols, out of which we can compose all P/T nets with
boundaries, fulfilling a long standing quest."
"Conway hemirings are Conway semirings without a multiplicative unit. We also
define iteration hemirings as Conway hemirings satisfying certain identities
associated with the finite groups. Iteration hemirings are iteration semirings
without a multiplicative unit. We provide an analysis of the relationship
between Conway hemirings and (partial) Conway semirings and describe several
free constructions. In the second part of the paper we define and study
hemimodules of Conway and iteration hemirings, and show their applicability in
the analysis of quantitative aspects of the infinitary behavior of weighted
transition systems. These include discounted and average computations of
weights."
"The paper investigates how the mathematical languages used to describe and to
observe automatic computations influence the accuracy of the obtained results.
In particular, we focus our attention on Single and Multi-tape Turing machines
which are described and observed through the lens of a new mathematical
language which is strongly based on three methodological ideas borrowed from
Physics and applied to Mathematics, namely: the distinction between the object
(we speak here about a mathematical object) of an observation and the
instrument used for this observation; interrelations holding between the object
and the tool used for the observation; the accuracy of the observation
determined by the tool. Results of the observation executed by the traditional
and new languages are compared and discussed."
"Reversible computing is a paradigm of computation that reflects physical
reversibility, one of the fundamental microscopic laws of Nature. In this
survey, we discuss topics on reversible logic elements with memory (RLEM),
which can be used to build reversible computing systems, and their
universality. An RLEM is called universal, if any reversible sequential machine
(RSM) can be realized as a circuit composed only of it. Since a finite-state
control and a tape cell of a reversible Turing machine (RTM) are formalized as
RSMs, any RTM can be constructed from a universal RLEM. Here, we investigate
2-state RLEMs, and show that infinitely many kinds of non-degenerate RLEMs are
all universal besides only four exceptions. Non-universality of these
exceptional RLEMs is also argued."
"Whether P systems with only one catalyst can already be computationally
complete, is still an open problem. Here we establish computational
completeness by using specific variants of additional control mechanisms. At
each step using only multiset rewriting rules from one set of a finite number
of sets of multiset rewriting rules allows for obtaining computational
completeness with one catalyst and only one membrane. If the targets are used
for choosing the multiset of rules to be applied, for getting computational
completeness with only one catalyst more than one membrane is needed. If the
available sets of rules change periodically with time, computational
completeness can be obtained with one catalyst in one membrane. Moreover, we
also improve existing computational completeness results for P systems with
mobile catalysts and for P systems with membrane creation."
"We consider the (one-dimensional) array counterpart of contextual as well as
insertion and deletion string grammars and consider the operations of array
insertion and deletion in array grammars. First we show that the emptiness
problem for P systems with (one-dimensional) insertion rules is undecidable.
Then we show computational completeness of P systems using (one-dimensional)
array insertion and deletion rules even of norm one only. The main result of
the paper exhibits computational completeness of one-dimensional array grammars
using array insertion and deletion rules of norm at most two."
"In this paper, we try to give the appropriate class of languages to which
belong various objects associated with tessellations in the hyperbolic plane."
"The languages of infinite timed words accepted by timed automata are
traditionally defined using Buchi-like conditions. These acceptance conditions
focus on the set of locations visited infinitely often along a run, but
completely ignore quantitative timing aspects. In this paper we propose a
natural quantitative semantics for timed automata based on the so-called
frequency, which measures the proportion of time spent in the accepting
locations. We study various properties of timed languages accepted with
positive frequency, and in particular the emptiness and universality problems."
"A gapped repeat is a factor of the form $uvu$ where $u$ and $v$ are nonempty
words. The period of the gapped repeat is defined as $|u|+|v|$. The gapped
repeat is maximal if it cannot be extended to the left or to the right by at
least one letter with preserving its period. The gapped repeat is called
$\alpha$-gapped if its period is not greater than $\alpha |v|$. A
$\delta$-subrepetition is a factor which exponent is less than 2 but is not
less than $1+\delta$ (the exponent of the factor is the quotient of the length
and the minimal period of the factor). The $\delta$-subrepetition is maximal if
it cannot be extended to the left or to the right by at least one letter with
preserving its minimal period. We reveal a close relation between maximal
gapped repeats and maximal subrepetitions. Moreover, we show that in a word of
length $n$ the number of maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats is bounded by
$O(\alpha^2n)$ and the number of maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions is bounded by
$O(n/\delta^2)$. Using the obtained upper bounds, we propose algorithms for
finding all maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats and all maximal
$\delta$-subrepetitions in a word of length $n$. The algorithm for finding all
maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats has $O(\alpha^2n)$ time complexity for the case
of constant alphabet size and $O(n\log n + \alpha^2n)$ time complexity for the
general case. For finding all maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions we propose two
algorithms. The first algorithm has $O(\frac{n\log\log n}{\delta^2})$ time
complexity for the case of constant alphabet size and $O(n\log n
+\frac{n\log\log n}{\delta^2})$ time complexity for the general case. The
second algorithm has $O(n\log n+\frac{n}{\delta^2}\log \frac{1}{\delta})$
expected time complexity."
"Call a string-to-string transducer regular if it can be realised by one of
the following equivalent models: mso transductions, two-way deterministic
automata with output, and streaming transducers with registers. This paper
proposes to treat origin information as part of the semantics of a regular
string-to-string transducer. With such semantics, the model admits a
machine-independent characterisation, Angluin-style learning in polynomial
time, as well as effective characterisations of natural subclasses such as
one-way transducers or first-order definable transducers."
"The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the size of its syntactic
semigroup. This semigroup is isomorphic to the transition semigroup of the
minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting the language, that is, to the
semigroup generated by transformations induced by non-empty words on the set of
states of the automaton. In this paper we search for the largest syntactic
semigroup of a star-free language having $n$ left quotients; equivalently, we
look for the largest transition semigroup of an aperiodic finite automaton with
$n$ states.
  We introduce two new aperiodic transition semigroups. The first is generated
by transformations that change only one state; we call such transformations and
resulting semigroups unitary. In particular, we study complete unitary
semigroups which have a special structure, and we show that each maximal
unitary semigroup is complete. For $n \ge 4$ there exists a complete unitary
semigroup that is larger than any aperiodic semigroup known to date.
  We then present even larger aperiodic semigroups, generated by
transformations that map a non-empty subset of states to a single state; we
call such transformations and semigroups semiconstant. In particular, we
examine semiconstant tree semigroups which have a structure based on full
binary trees. The semiconstant tree semigroups are at present the best
candidates for largest aperiodic semigroups.
  We also prove that $2^n-1$ is an upper bound on the state complexity of
reversal of star-free languages, and resolve an open problem about a special
case of state complexity of concatenation of star-free languages."
"We prove two tight bounds on the behavior of a model of self-assembling
particles introduced by Dabby and Chen (SODA 2013), called insertion systems,
where monomers insert themselves into the middle of a growing linear polymer.
First, we prove that the expressive power of these systems is equal to
context-free grammars, answering a question posed by Dabby and Chen. Second, we
prove that systems of $k$ monomer types can deterministically construct
polymers of length $n = 2^{\Theta(k^{3/2})}$ in $O(\log^{5/3}(n))$ expected
time, and that this is optimal in both the number of monomer types and expected
time."
"We consider the first problem that appears in any application of
synchronizing automata, namely, the problem of deciding whether or not a given
$n$-state $k$-letter automaton is synchronizing. First we generalize results
from \cite{RandSynch},\cite{On2Problems} for the case of strongly connected
partial automata. Specifically, for $k>1$ we show that an automaton is
synchronizing with probability $1-O(\frac{1}{n^{0.5k}})$ and present an
algorithm with linear in $n$ expected time, while the best known algorithm is
quadratic on each instance. This results are interesting due to their
applications in synchronization of finite state information sources.
  After that we consider the synchronization of reachable partial automata that
has application for splicing systems in computational biology. For this case we
prove that the problem of testing a given automaton for synchronization is
NP-complete."
"In this paper we show that {\omega}B- and {\omega}S-regular languages satisfy
the following separation-type theorem If L1,L2 are disjoint languages of
{\omega}-words both recognised by {\omega}B- (resp. {\omega}S)-automata then
there exists an {\omega}-regular language Lsep that contains L1, and whose
complement contains L2. In particular, if a language and its complement are
recognised by {\omega}B- (resp. {\omega}S)-automata then the language is
{\omega}-regular. The result is especially interesting because, as shown by
Boja\'nczyk and Colcombet, {\omega}B-regular languages are complements of
{\omega}S-regular languages. Therefore, the above theorem shows that these are
two mutually dual classes that both have the separation property. Usually (e.g.
in descriptive set theory or recursion theory) exactly one class from a pair C,
Cc has the separation property. The proof technique reduces the separation
property for {\omega}-word languages to profinite languages using Ramsey's
theorem and topological methods. After that reduction, the analysis of the
separation property in the profinite monoid is relatively simple. The whole
construction is technically not complicated, moreover it seems to be quite
extensible. The paper uses a framework for the analysis of B- and S-regular
languages in the context of the profinite monoid that was proposed by
Toru\'nczyk."
"A non-deterministic automaton running on infinite trees is unambiguous if it
has at most one accepting run on every tree. The class of languages
recognisable by unambiguous tree automata is still not well-understood. In
particular, decidability of the problem whether a given language is
recognisable by some unambiguous automaton is open. Moreover, there are no
known upper bounds on the descriptive complexity of unambiguous languages among
all regular tree languages.
  In this paper we show the following complexity collapse: if a
non-deterministic parity tree automaton $A$ is unambiguous and its priorities
are between $i$ and $2n$ then the language recognised by $A$ is in the class
$Comp(i+1,2n)$. A particular case of this theorem is for $i=n=1$: if $A$ is an
unambiguous Buchi tree automaton then $L(A)$ is recognisable by a weak
alternating automaton (or equivalently definable in weak MSO). The main
motivation for this result is a theorem by Finkel and Simonnet stating that
every unambiguous Buchi automaton recognises a Borel language.
  The assumptions of the presented theorem are syntactic (we require one
automaton to be both unambiguous and of particular parity index). However, to
the authors' best knowledge this is the first theorem showing a collapse of the
parity index that exploits the fact that a given automaton is unambiguous."
"This paper introduces a set of acoustic modeling techniques for utterance
verification (UV) based continuous speech recognition (CSR). Utterance
verification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a
hypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or
out-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is
implemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that
are presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary
testing, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on
the optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The
second technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state
transducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for
major components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models
(HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical
grammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the
acoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study
presented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a
significant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found
that the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the
UV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared
to existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of
the finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in
training acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning
the formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these
techniques with statistical language models."
"Champarnaud and Ziadi, and Khorsi et al. show how to compute the equation
automaton of word regular expression $E$ via the $k$-C-Continuations.
  Kuske and Meinecke extend the computation of the equation automaton to a
regular tree expression $E$ over a ranked alphabet $\Sigma$ and produce a
$O(R\cdot|E|^2)$ time and space complexity algorithm, where $R$ is the maximal
rank of a symbol occurring in $\Sigma$ and $|E|$ is the size of $E$. In this
paper, we give a full description of the algorithm based on the acyclic
minimization of Revuz. Our algorithm, which is performed in an $O(|Q|\cdot|E|)$
time and space complexity, where $|Q|$ is the number of states of the produced
automaton, is more efficient than the one obtained by Kuske and Meinecke."
"We study the qualitative and quantitative zero-reachability problem in
probabilistic multi-counter systems. We identify the undecidable variants of
the problems, and then we concentrate on the remaining two cases. In the first
case, when we are interested in the probability of all runs that visit zero in
some counter, we show that the qualitative zero-reachability is decidable in
time which is polynomial in the size of a given pMC and doubly exponential in
the number of counters. Further, we show that the probability of all
zero-reaching runs can be effectively approximated up to an arbitrarily small
given error epsilon > 0 in time which is polynomial in log(epsilon),
exponential in the size of a given pMC, and doubly exponential in the number of
counters. In the second case, we are interested in the probability of all runs
that visit zero in some counter different from the last counter. Here we show
that the qualitative zero-reachability is decidable and SquareRootSum-hard, and
the probability of all zero-reaching runs can be effectively approximated up to
an arbitrarily small given error epsilon > 0 (these result applies to pMC
satisfying a suitable technical condition that can be verified in polynomial
time). The proof techniques invented in the second case allow to construct
counterexamples for some classical results about ergodicity in stochastic Petri
nets."
"We study the equality problem for infinite words obtained by iterating
morphisms. In particular, we give a practical algorithm to decide whether or
not two words generated by primitive morphisms are equal."
"A language $L$ is the orthogonal catenation of languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ if
every word of $L$ can be written in a unique way as a catenation of a word in
$L_1$ and a word in $L_2$. We establish a tight bound for the state complexity
of orthogonal catenation of regular languages. The bound is smaller than the
bound for arbitrary catenation."
"The problem of computing the edit-distance between a string and a finite
automaton arises in a variety of applications in computational biology, text
processing, and speech recognition. This paper presents linear-space algorithms
for computing the edit-distance between a string and an arbitrary weighted
automaton over the tropical semiring, or an unambiguous weighted automaton over
an arbitrary semiring. It also gives an efficient linear-space algorithm for
finding an optimal alignment of a string and such a weighted automaton."
"Finite-turn pushdown automata (PDA) are investigated concerning their
descriptional complexity. It is known that they accept exactly the class of
ultralinear context-free languages. Furthermore, the increase in size when
converting arbitrary PDAs accepting ultralinear languages to finite-turn PDAs
cannot be bounded by any recursive function. The latter phenomenon is known as
non-recursive trade-off. In this paper, finite-turn PDAs accepting bounded
languages are considered. First, letter-bounded languages are studied. We prove
that in this case the non-recursive trade-off is reduced to a recursive
trade-off, more precisely, to an exponential trade-off. A conversion algorithm
is presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by proving tight
lower bounds. Furthermore, the question of reducing the number of turns of a
given finite-turn PDA is studied. Again, a conversion algorithm is provided
which shows that in this case the trade-off is at most polynomial. Finally, the
more general case of word-bounded languages is investigated. We show how the
results obtained for letter-bounded languages can be extended to word-bounded
languages."
"The simulation of deterministic pushdown automata defined over a one-letter
alphabet by finite state automata is investigated from a descriptional
complexity point of view. We show that each unary deterministic pushdown
automaton of size s can be simulated by a deterministic finite automaton with a
number of states that is exponential in s. We prove that this simulation is
tight. Furthermore, its cost cannot be reduced even if it is performed by a
two-way nondeterministic automaton. We also prove that there are unary
languages for which deterministic pushdown automata cannot be exponentially
more succinct than finite automata. In order to state this result, we
investigate the conversion of deterministic pushdown automata into context-free
grammars. We prove that in the unary case the number of variables in the
resulting grammar is strictly smaller than the number of variables needed in
the case of nonunary alphabets."
"This paper gives answers to questions formulated as open in the paper ""On
State Observability in Deterministic Finite Automata"" by A. Mateescu and Gh.
Paun. Specifically, it demonstrates that for all k >= 2, the families of
regular languages acceptable by deterministic finite automata with no more than
k semi-observable states, denoted by Tk, are anti-AFL's, and that the family T1
differs in the closure property under Kleene +."
"It is well known, and easy to see, that not each nondeterministic Buchi
automaton on infinite words can be simulated by a nondeterministic co-Buchi
automaton. We show that in the cases when such a simulation is possible, the
number of states needed for it can grow nonlinearly. More precisely, we show a
sequence of - as we believe, simple and elegant - languages which witness the
existence of a nondeterministic Buchi automaton with n states, which can be
simulated by a nondeterministic co-Buchi automaton, but cannot be simulated by
any nondeterministic co-Buchi automaton with less than c*n^{7/6} states for
some constant c. This improves on the best previously known lower bound of
3(n-1)/2."
"In this paper we introduce the notion of quasi-expansivity for 2D CA and we
show that it shares many properties with expansivity (that holds only for 1D
CA). Similarly, we introduce the notions of quasi-sensitivity and prove that
the classical dichotomy theorem holds in this new setting. Moreover, we show a
tight relation between closingness and openness for 2D CA. Finally, the
undecidability of closingness property for 2D CA is proved."
"We give an unique string representation, up to isomorphism, for initially
connected deterministic finite automata (ICDFAs) with n states over an alphabet
of k symbols. We show how to generate all these strings for each n and k, and
how its enumeration provides an alternative way to obtain the exact number of
ICDFAs."
"We consider variations on the following problem: given an NFA M and a pattern
p, does there exist an x in L(M) such that p matches x? We consider the
restricted problem where M only accepts a finite language. We also consider the
variation where the pattern p is required only to match a factor of x. We show
that both of these problems are NP-complete. We also consider the same problems
for context-free grammars; in this case the problems become PSPACE-complete."
"In general, the representation of combinatorial objects is decisive for the
feasibility of several enumerative tasks. In this work, we show how a (unique)
string representation for (complete) initially-connected deterministic automata
(ICDFAs) with n states over an alphabet of k symbols can be used for counting,
exact enumeration, sampling and optimal coding, not only the set of ICDFAs but,
to some extent, the set of regular languages. An exact generation algorithm can
be used to partition the set of ICDFAs in order to parallelize the counting of
minimal automata (and thus of regular languages). We present also a uniform
random generator for ICDFAs that uses a table of pre-calculated values. Based
on the same table it is also possible to obtain an optimal coding for ICDFAs."
"We study a two-dimensional cellular automaton (CA), called Diffusion Rule
(DR), which exhibits diffusion-like dynamics of propagating patterns. In
computational experiments we discover a wide range of mobile and stationary
localizations (gliders, oscillators, glider guns, puffer trains, etc), analyze
spatio-temporal dynamics of collisions between localizations, and discuss
possible applications in unconventional computing."
"We study transformations of 2-, 4- and 6-bit numbers in interactions between
traveling and stationary localizations in the Spiral Rule reaction-diffusion
cellular automaton. The Spiral Rule automaton is a hexagonal ternary-state
two-dimensional cellular automaton -- a finite-state machine imitation of an
activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system. The activator is self-inhibited
in certain concentrations. The inhibitor dissociates in the absence of the
activator. The Spiral Rule cellular automaton has rich spatio-temporal dynamics
of traveling (glider) and stationary (eater) patterns. When a glider brushes an
eater the eater may slightly change its configuration, which is updated once
more every next hit. We encode binary strings in the states of eaters and
sequences of gliders. We study what types of binary compositions of binary
strings are implementable by sequences of gliders brushing an eater. The models
developed will be used in future laboratory designs of reaction-diffusion
chemical computers."
"We study the state complexity of regular operations in the class of ideal
languages. A language L over an alphabet Sigma is a right (left) ideal if it
satisfies L = L Sigma* (L = Sigma* L). It is a two-sided ideal if L = Sigma* L
Sigma *, and an all-sided ideal if it is the shuffle of Sigma* with L. We
prefer the term ""quotient complexity"" instead of ""state complexity"", and we use
derivatives to calculate upper bounds on quotient complexity, whenever it is
convenient. We find tight upper bounds on the quotient complexity of each type
of ideal language in terms of the complexity of an arbitrary generator and of
its minimal generator, the complexity of the minimal generator, and also on the
operations union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference,
concatenation, star and reversal of ideal languages."
"We give a canonical representation for trim acyclic deterministic finite
automata (Adfa) with n states over an alphabet of k symbols. Using this normal
form, we present a backtracking algorithm for the exact generation of Adfas.
This algorithm is a non trivial adaptation of the algorithm for the exact
generation of minimal acyclic deterministic finite automata, presented by
Almeida et al."
"We investigate the continuity of the \omega-functions and real functions
defined by weighted finite automata (WFA). We concentrate on the case of
average preserving WFA. We show that every continuous \omega-function definable
by some WFA can be defined by an average preserving WFA and then characterize
minimal average preserving WFA whose \omega-function or \omega-function and
real function are continuous.
  We obtain several algorithmic reductions for WFA-related decision problems.
In particular, we show that deciding whether the \omega-function and real
function of an average preserving WFA are both continuous is computationally
equivalent to deciding stability of a set of matrices.
  We also present a method for constructing WFA that compute continuous real
functions."
"We give a sequential model for noninterference security including probability
(but not demonic choice), thus supporting reasoning about the likelihood that
high-security values might be revealed by observations of low-security
activity. Our novel methodological contribution is the definition of a
refinement order and its use to compare security measures between
specifications and (their supposed) implementations. This contrasts with the
more common practice of evaluating the security of individual programs in
isolation.
  The appropriateness of our model and order is supported by our showing that
our refinement order is the greatest compositional relation --the compositional
closure-- with respect to our semantics and an ""elementary"" order based on
Bayes Risk --- a security measure already in widespread use. We also relate
refinement to other measures such as Shannon Entropy.
  By applying the approach to a non-trivial example, the anonymous-majority
Three-Judges protocol, we demonstrate by example that correctness arguments can
be simplified by the sort of layered developments --through levels of
increasing detail-- that are allowed and encouraged by compositional semantics."
"In this report we study the problem of minimising deterministic automata over
finite and infinite words. Deterministic finite automata are the simplest
devices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic Buchi, Co-Buchi, and
parity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \omega-regular
languages. While it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite
and weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic Buchi
and parity automata has remained an open challenge. We establish the
NP-completeness of these problems. A second contribution of this report is the
introduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. Like
hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the
language of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a
monitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a
system. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation,
relaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi)
automata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective
equivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we
allow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be
considered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation
from the perspective of finite automata. From the perspective of Buchi and
Co-Buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that
also turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space
reductions put on top of it."
"Sampled semantics of timed automata is a finite approximation of their dense
time behavior. While the former is closer to the actual software or hardware
systems with a fixed granularity of time, the abstract character of the latter
makes it appealing for system modeling and verification. We study one aspect of
the relation between these two semantics, namely checking whether the system
exhibits some qualitative (untimed) behaviors in the dense time which cannot be
reproduced by any implementation with a fixed sampling rate. More formally, the
\emph{sampling problem} is to decide whether there is a sampling rate such that
all qualitative behaviors (the untimed language) accepted by a given timed
automaton in dense time semantics can be also accepted in sampled semantics. We
show that this problem is decidable."
"We consider algebras of rational power series over an alphabet $\Sigma$ with
coefficients in a commutative semiring $K$ and characterize them as the free
algebras in various classes of algebraic structures."
"This paper is a continuation of our research work on state complexity of
combined operations. Motivated by applications, we study the state complexities
of two particular combined operations: catenation combined with star and
catenation combined with reversal. We show that the state complexities of both
of these combined operations are considerably less than the compositions of the
state complexities of their individual participating operations."
"In this article, we consider the operations of insertion and deletion working
in a graph-controlled manner. We show that like in the case of context-free
productions, the computational power is strictly increased when using a control
graph: computational completeness can be obtained by systems with insertion or
deletion rules involving at most two symbols in a contextual or in a
context-free manner and with the control graph having only four nodes."
"In this paper, we consider the transition complexity of regular languages
based on the incomplete deterministic finite automata. A number of results on
Boolean operations have been obtained. It is shown that the transition
complexity results for union and complementation are very different from the
state complexity results for the same operations. However, for intersection,
the transition complexity result is similar to that of state complexity."
"One of the theoretical models proposed for the mechanism of gene unscrambling
in some species of ciliates is the template-guided recombination (TGR) system
by Prescott, Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg which has been generalized by Daley and
McQuillan from a formal language theory perspective. In this paper, we propose
a refinement of this model that generates regular languages using the iterated
TGR system with a finite initial language and a finite set of templates, using
fewer templates and a smaller alphabet compared to that of the Daley-McQuillan
model. To achieve Turing completeness using only finite components, i.e., a
finite initial language and a finite set of templates, we also propose an
extension of the contextual template-guided recombination system (CTGR system)
by Daley and McQuillan, by adding an extra control called permitting contexts
on the usage of templates."
"The first step when forming the polynomial hierarchies of languages is to
consider languages of the form KaL where K and L are over a finite alphabet A
and from a given variety V of languages, a being a letter from A. All such
KaL's generate the variety of languages BPol1(V).
  We estimate the numerical parameters of the language KaL in terms of their
values for K and L. These parameters include the state complexity of the
minimal complete DFA and the size of the syntactic monoids. We also estimate
the cardinality of the image of A* in the Schuetzenberger product of the
syntactic monoids of K and L. In these three cases we obtain the optimal
bounds.
  Finally, we also consider estimates for the cardinalities of free monoids in
the variety of monoids corresponding to BPol1(V) in terms of sizes of the free
monoids in the variety of monoids corresponding to V."
"Recently, the problem of obtaining a short regular expression equivalent to a
given finite automaton has been intensively investigated. Algorithms for
converting finite automata to regular expressions have an exponential blow-up
in the worst-case. To overcome this, simple heuristic methods have been
proposed.
  In this paper we analyse some of the heuristics presented in the literature
and propose new ones. We also present some experimental comparative results
based on uniform random generated deterministic finite automata."
"We consider the state complexity of basic operations on tree languages
recognized by deterministic unranked tree automata. For the operations of union
and intersection the upper and lower bounds of both weakly and strongly
deterministic tree automata are obtained. For tree concatenation we establish a
tight upper bound that is of a different order than the known state complexity
of concatenation of regular string languages. We show that (n+1) (
(m+1)2^n-2^(n-1) )-1 vertical states are sufficient, and necessary in the worst
case, to recognize the concatenation of tree languages recognized by (strongly
or weakly) deterministic automata with, respectively, m and n vertical states."
"We consider the representational state complexity of unranked tree automata.
The bottom-up computation of an unranked tree automaton may be either
deterministic or nondeterministic, and further variants arise depending on
whether the horizontal string languages defining the transitions are
represented by a DFA or an NFA. Also, we consider for unranked tree automata
the alternative syntactic definition of determinism introduced by Cristau et
al. (FCT'05, Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 3623, pp. 68-79).
  We establish upper and lower bounds for the state complexity of conversions
between different types of unranked tree automata."
"We investigate the descriptional complexity of limited propagating
Lindenmayer systems and their deterministic and tabled variants with respect to
the number of rules and the number of symbols. We determine the decrease of
complexity when the generative capacity is increased. For incomparable
families, we give languages that can be described more efficiently in either of
these families than in the other."
"We investigate the nondeterministic state complexity of basic operations for
suffix-free regular languages. The nondeterministic state complexity of an
operation is the number of states that are necessary and sufficient in the
worst-case for a minimal nondeterministic finite-state automaton that accepts
the language obtained from the operation. We consider basic operations
(catenation, union, intersection, Kleene star, reversal and complementation)
and establish matching upper and lower bounds for each operation. In the case
of complementation the upper and lower bounds differ by an additive constant of
two."
"We examine deterministic and nondeterministic state complexities of regular
operations on prefix-free languages. We strengthen several results by providing
witness languages over smaller alphabets, usually as small as possible. We next
provide the tight bounds on state complexity of symmetric difference, and
deterministic and nondeterministic state complexity of difference and cyclic
shift of prefix-free languages."
"We define a two-step learner for RFSAs based on an observation table by using
an algorithm for minimal DFAs to build a table for the reversal of the language
in question and showing that we can derive the minimal RFSA from it after some
simple modifications. We compare the algorithm to two other table-based ones of
which one (by Bollig et al. 2009) infers a RFSA directly, and the other is
another two-step learner proposed by the author. We focus on the criterion of
query complexity."
"With this contribution we would like to remember Chandra M. R. Kintala who
passed away in November 2009. We will give short overviews of his CV and his
contributions to the field of theoretical and applied computer science and,
given the opportunity, will attempt to present the current state of limited
nondeterminism and limited resources for machines. Finally, we will briefly
touch on some research topics which hopefully will be addressed in the not so
distant future."
"Finite-state complexity is a variant of algorithmic information theory
obtained by replacing Turing machines with finite transducers. We consider the
state-size of transducers needed for minimal descriptions of arbitrary strings
and, as our main result, we show that the state-size hierarchy with respect to
a standard encoding is infinite. We consider also hierarchies yielded by more
general computable encodings."
"Under some mild assumptions, we study the state complexity of the trim
minimal automaton accepting the greedy representations of the multiples of m >=
2 for a wide class of linear numeration systems. As an example, the number of
states of the trim minimal automaton accepting the greedy representations of
the multiples of m in the Fibonacci system is exactly 2m^2."
"We show that it is decidable in exponential time whether the lexicographic
ordering of a context-free language is scattered, or a well-ordering."
"In this paper, we prove decidability properties and new results on the
position of the family of languages generated by (circular) splicing systems
within the Chomsky hierarchy. The two main results of the paper are the
following. First, we show that it is decidable, given a circular splicing
language and a regular language, whether they are equal. Second, we prove the
language generated by an alphabetic splicing system is context-free. Alphabetic
splicing systems are a generalization of simple and semi-simple splicin systems
already considered in the literature."
"We show that a subclass of infinite-state probabilistic programs that can be
modeled by probabilistic one-counter automata (pOC) admits an efficient
quantitative analysis. In particular, we show that the expected termination
time can be approximated up to an arbitrarily small relative error with
polynomially many arithmetic operations, and the same holds for the probability
of all runs that satisfy a given omega-regular property. Further, our results
establish a powerful link between pOC and martingale theory, which leads to
fundamental observations about quantitative properties of runs in pOC. In
particular, we provide a ""divergence gap theorem"", which bounds a positive
non-termination probability in pOC away from zero."
"We introduce formal languages over infinite alphabets where words may contain
binders. We define the notions of nominal language, nominal monoid, and nominal
regular expressions. Moreover, we extend history-dependent automata
(HD-automata) by adding stack, and study the recognisability of nominal
languages."
"We study novel simulation-like preorders for quotienting nondeterministic
B\""uchi automata. We define fixed-word delayed simulation, a new preorder
coarser than delayed simulation. We argue that fixed-word simulation is the
coarsest forward simulation-like preorder which can be used for quotienting
B\""uchi automata, thus improving our understanding of the limits of
quotienting. Also, we show that computing fixed-word simulation is
PSPACE-complete. On the practical side, we introduce proxy simulations, which
are novel polynomial-time computable preorders sound for quotienting. In
particular, delayed proxy simulation induce quotients that can be smaller by an
arbitrarily large factor than direct backward simulation. We derive proxy
simulations as the product of a theory of refinement transformers: A refinement
transformer maps preorders non-decreasingly, preserving certain properties. We
study under which general conditions refinement transformers are sound for
quotienting."
"Hairpin completion and its variant called bounded hairpin completion are
operations on formal languages, inspired by a hairpin formation in molecular
biology. Another variant called hairpin lengthening has been recently
introduced and studied on the closure properties and algorithmic problems
concerning several families of languages. In this paper, we introduce a new
operation of this kind, called hairpin incompletion which is not only an
extension of bounded hairpin completion, but also a restricted (bounded)
variant of hairpin lengthening. Further, the hairpin incompletion operation
provides a formal language theoretic framework that models a bio-molecular
technique nowadays known as Whiplash PCR. We study the closure properties of
language families under both the operation and its iterated version. We show
that a family of languages closed under intersection with regular sets,
concatenation with regular sets, and finite union is closed under one-sided
iterated hairpin incompletion, and that a family of languages containing all
linear languages and closed under circular permutation, left derivative and
substitution is also closed under iterated hairpin incompletion."
"We show that every regular language defines a unique nondeterministic finite
automaton (NFA), which we call ""\'atomaton"", whose states are the ""atoms"" of
the language, that is, non-empty intersections of complemented or
uncomplemented left quotients of the language. We describe methods of
constructing the \'atomaton, and prove that it is isomorphic to the reverse
automaton of the minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of the reverse
language. We study ""atomic"" NFAs in which the right language of every state is
a union of atoms. We generalize Brzozowski's double-reversal method for
minimizing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), showing that the result of
applying the subset construction to an NFA is a minimal DFA if and only if the
reverse of the NFA is atomic. We prove that Sengoku's claim that his method
always finds a minimal NFA is false."
"We give another proof of a theorem of Fife - understood broadly as providing
a finite automaton that gives a complete description of all infinite binary
overlap-free words. Our proof is significantly simpler than those in the
literature. As an application we give a complete characterization of the
overlap-free words that are 2-automatic."
"We consider ideals and Boolean combinations of ideals. For the regular
languages within these classes we give expressively complete automaton models.
In addition, we consider general properties of regular ideals and their Boolean
combinations. These properties include effective algebraic characterizations
and lattice identities.
  In the main part of this paper we consider the following deterministic
one-way automaton models: unions of flip automata, weak automata, and
Staiger-Wagner automata. We show that each of these models is expressively
complete for regular Boolean combination of right ideals. Right ideals over
finite words resemble the open sets in the Cantor topology over infinite words.
An omega-regular language is a Boolean combination of open sets if and only if
it is recognizable by a deterministic Staiger-Wagner automaton; and our result
can be seen as a finitary version of this classical theorem. In addition, we
also consider the canonical automaton models for right ideals, prefix-closed
languages, and factorial languages.
  In the last section, we consider a two-way automaton model which is known to
be expressively complete for two-variable first-order logic. We show that the
above concepts can be adapted to these two-way automata such that the resulting
languages are the right ideals (resp. prefix-closed languages, resp. Boolean
combinations of right ideals) definable in two-variable first-order logic."
"In this paper we study the equivalence of nondeterministic automata pairing
the concept of a bisimulation with the recently introduced concept of a uniform
relation. In this symbiosis, uniform relations serve as equivalence relations
which relate states of two possibly different nondeterministic automata, and
bisimulations ensure compatibility with the transitions, initial and terminal
states of these automata. We define six types of bisimulations, but due to the
duality we discuss three of them: forward, backward-forward, and weak forward
bisimulations. For each od these three types of bisimulations we provide a
procedure which decides whether there is a bisimulation of this type between
two automata, and when it exists, the same procedure computes the greatest one.
We also show that there is a uniform forward bisimulation between two automata
if and only if the factor automata with respect to the greatest forward
bisimulation equivalences on these automata are isomorphic. We prove a similar
theorem for weak forward bisimulations, using the concept of a weak forward
isomorphism instead of an isomorphism. We also give examples that explain the
relationships between the considered types of bisimulations."
"The problem of k-minimisation for a DFA M is the computation of a smallest
DFA N (where the size |M| of a DFA M is the size of the domain of the
transition function) such that their recognized languages differ only on words
of length less than k. The previously best algorithm, which runs in time O(|M|
log^2 n) where n is the number of states, is extended to DFAs with partial
transition functions. Moreover, a faster O(|M| log n) algorithm for DFAs that
recognise finite languages is presented. In comparison to the previous
algorithm for total DFAs, the new algorithm is much simpler and allows the
calculation of a k-minimal DFA for each k in parallel. Secondly, it is
demonstrated that calculating the least number of introduced errors is hard:
Given a DFA M and numbers k and m, it is NP-hard to decide whether there exists
a k-minimal DFA N differing from DFA M on at most m words. A similar result
holds for hyper-minimisation of DFAs in general: Given a DFA M and numbers s
and m, it is NP-hard to decide whether there exists a DFA N with at most s
states such that DFA M and N differ on at msot m words."
"This paper summarizes the fundamental expressiveness, closure, and
decidability properties of various finite-state automata classes with multiple
input tapes. It also includes an original algorithm for the intersection of
one-way nondeterministic finite-state automata."
"Deciding in an efficient way weak probabilistic bisimulation in the context
of Probabilistic Automata is an open problem for about a decade. In this work
we close this problem by proposing a procedure that checks in polynomial time
the existence of a weak combined transition satisfying the step condition of
the bisimulation. We also present several extensions of weak combined
transitions, such as hyper-transitions and the new concepts of allowed weak
combined and hyper-transitions and of equivalence matching, that turn out to be
verifiable in polynomial time as well. These results set the ground for the
development of more effective compositional analysis algorithms for
probabilistic systems."
"Our aim is to construct a finite automaton recognizing the set of words that
are at a bounded distance from some word of a given regular language. We define
new regular operators, the similarity operators, based on a generalization of
the notion of distance and we introduce the family of regular expressions
extended to similarity operators, that we call AREs (Approximate Regular
Expressions). We set formulae to compute the Brzozowski derivatives and the
Antimirov derivatives of an ARE, which allows us to give a solution to the ARE
membership problem and to provide the construction of two recognizers for the
language denoted by an ARE. As far as we know, the family of approximative
regular expressions is introduced for the first time in this paper. Classical
approximate regular expression matching algorithms are approximate matching
algorithms on regular expressions. Our approach is rather to process an exact
matching on approximate regular expressions."
"Top-down parsing has received much attention recently. Parsing expression
grammars (PEG) allows construction of linear time parsers using packrat
algorithm. These techniques however suffer from problem of prefix hiding. We
use alternative formalism of relativized regular expressions REGREG for which
top-down backtracking parser runs in linear time. This formalism allows to
construct fast parsers with modest memory requirements for practical grammars.
We show that our formalism is equivalent to PEG."
"We give partial results on the factorization conjecture on codes proposed by
Schutzenberger. We consider finite maximal codes C over the alphabet A = {a, b}
with C \cap a^* = a^p, for a prime number p. Let P, S in Z <A>, with S = S_0 +
S_1, supp(S_0) \subset a^* and supp(S_1) \subset a^*b supp(S_0). We prove that
if (P,S) is a factorization for C then (P,S) is positive, that is P,S have
coefficients 0,1, and we characterize the structure of these codes. As a
consequence, we prove that if C is a finite maximal code such that each word in
C has at most 4 occurrences of b's and a^p is in C, then each factorization for
C is a positive factorization. We also discuss the structure of these codes.
The obtained results show once again relations between (positive)
factorizations and factorizations of cyclic groups."
"An automaton is universal if it accepts every possible input. We study the
notion of u-universality, which asserts that the automaton accepts every input
starting with u. Universality and u-universality are both EXPTIME-hard for
non-deterministic tree automata. We propose efficient antichain-based
techniques to address these problems for visibly pushdown automata operating on
trees. One of our approaches yields algorithms for the universality and
u-universality of hedge automata."
"In (Csuhaj-Varju et. al. 2000) Parallel Communicating Systems of Pushdown
Automata (PCPA) were introduced and shown to be able to simulate
nondeterministic one-way multi-head pushdown automata in returning mode, even
if communication is restricted to be one-way having a single target component.
A simulation of such centralized PCPA by one-way multi-head pushdown automata
(Balan 2009) turned out to be incomplete (Otto 2012). Subsequently it was shown
that centralized returning PCPA are universal even if the number of components
is two (Petersen 2013) and thus are separated from one-way multi-head pushdown
automata. Another line of research modified the definition of PCPA such that
communication is asynchronous (Otto 2013). While the simulation of one-way
multi-head pushdown automata is still possible, now a converse construction
shows this model in returning mode to be equivalent to the one-way multi-head
pushdown automaton in a very precise sense. It was left open, whether
non-centralized returning PCPA of degree two are universal. In the first part
of the paper we show this to be the case. Then we turn our attention to Uniform
Distributed Pushdown Automata Systems (UDPAS). These systems of automata work
in turn on a single tape. We show that UPDAS accepting with empty stack do not
form a hierarchy depending on the number of components and that the membership
problem is complete in NP, answering two open problems from (Arroyo et. al.
2012)."
"The quotient complexity of a regular language L is the number of left
quotients of L, which is the same as the state complexity of L. Suppose that L
and L' are binary regular languages with quotient complexities m and n, and
that the transition semigroups of the minimal deterministic automata accepting
L and L' are the symmetric groups S_m and S_n of degrees m and n, respectively.
Denote by o any binary boolean operation that is not a constant and not a
function of one argument only. For m,n >= 2 with (m,n) not in
{(2,2),(3,4),(4,3),(4,4)} we prove that the quotient complexity of LoL' is mn
if and only either (a) m is not equal to n or (b) m=n and the bases (ordered
pairs of generators) of S_m and S_n are not conjugate. For (m,n)\in
{(2,2),(3,4),(4,3),(4,4)} we give examples to show that this need not hold. In
proving these results we generalize the notion of uniform minimality to direct
products of automata. We also establish a non-trivial connection between
complexity of boolean operations and group theory."
"Multi-stack pushdown systems are a well-studied model of concurrent
computation using threads with first-order procedure calls. While, in general,
reachability is undecidable, there are numerous restrictions on stack behaviour
that lead to decidability. To model higher-order procedures calls, a
generalisation of pushdown stacks called collapsible pushdown stacks are
required. Reachability problems for multi-stack collapsible pushdown systems
have been little studied. Here, we study ordered, phase-bounded and
scope-bounded multi-stack collapsible pushdown systems using saturation
techniques, showing decidability of control state reachability and giving a
regular representation of all configurations that can reach a given control
state."
"Formal grammars are extensively used in Computer Science and related fields
to study the rules which govern production of a language. The use of these
grammars can be extended beyond mere language production. One possibility is to
view these grammars as logical machines, similar to automata, which can be
modified to compute or help in computation, while also performing the basic
task of language production. The difference between such a modified grammar and
an automaton will then lie in the semantics of computation performed. It is
even possible for such a grammar to appear non-functional (when no language is
produced as a result of its productions), but in reality, it might be carrying
out important tasks. Such grammars have been named Functional Grammars
(including a special sub-category, called Virtual Grammars), and their
properties are studied in the paper."
"This paper investigates acceptance conditions for finite automata recognizing
omega-regular languages. As a first result, we show that, under any acceptance
condition that can be defined in the MSO logic, a finite automaton can
recognize at most omega-regular languages. Starting from this, the paper aims
at classifying acceptance conditions according to their expressive power and at
finding the exact position of the classes of omega-languages they induced
according to the Borel hierarchy. A new interesting acceptance condition is
introduced and fully characterized. A step forward is also made in the
understanding of the expressive power of (fin, =)."
"Networks of timed automata (NTA) are widely used to model distributed
real-time systems. Quite often in the literature, the automata are allowed to
share clocks, i.e. transitions of one automaton may be guarded by conditions on
the value of clocks reset by another automaton. This is a problem when one
considers implementing such model in a distributed architecture, since reading
clocks a priori requires communications which are not explicitly described in
the model. We focus on the following question: given an NTA A1 || A2 where A2
reads some clocks reset by A1, does there exist an NTA A'1 || A'2 without
shared clocks with the same behavior as the initial NTA? For this, we allow the
automata to exchange information during synchronizations only, in particular by
copying the value of their neighbor's clocks. We discuss a formalization of the
problem and define an appropriate behavioural equivalence. Then we give a
criterion using the notion of contextual timed transition system, which
represents the behavior of A2 when in parallel with A1. Finally, we effectively
build A'1 || A'2 when it exists."
"The understanding of Boolean automata networks dynamics takes an important
place in various domains of computer science such as computability, complexity
and discrete dynamical systems. In this paper, we make a step further in this
understanding by focusing on their cycles, whose necessity in networks is known
as the brick of their complexity. We present new results that provide a
characterisation of the transient and asymptotic dynamics, i.e. of the
computational abilities, of asynchronous Boolean automata networks composed of
two cycles that intersect at one automaton, the so-called double-cycles. To do
so, we introduce an efficient formalism inspired by algorithms to define long
sequences of updates, that allows a better description of their dynamics than
previous works in this area."
"One-counter nets (OCN) are Petri nets with exactly one unbounded place. They
are equivalent to a subclass of one-counter automata with just a weak test for
zero. Unlike many other semantic equivalences, strong and weak simulation
preorder are decidable for OCN, but the computational complexity was an open
problem. We show that both strong and weak simulation preorder on OCN are
PSPACE-complete."
"We propose regular expressions to abstractly model and study properties of
resource-aware computations. Inspired by nominal techniques -- as those popular
in process calculi -- we extend classical regular expressions with names (to
model computational resources) and suitable operators (for allocation,
deallocation, scoping of, and freshness conditions on resources). We discuss
classes of such nominal regular expressions, show how such expressions have
natural interpretations in terms of languages over infinite alphabets, and give
Kleene theorems to characterise their formal languages in terms of nominal
automata."
"The benchmark for computation is typically given as Turing computability; the
ability for a computation to be performed by a Turing Machine. Many languages
exploit (indirect) encodings of Turing Machines to demonstrate their ability to
support arbitrary computation. However, these encodings are usually by
simulating the entire Turing Machine within the language, or by encoding a
language that does an encoding or simulation itself. This second category is
typical for process calculi that show an encoding of lambda-calculus (often
with restrictions) that in turn simulates a Turing Machine. Such approaches
lead to indirect encodings of Turing Machines that are complex, unclear, and
only weakly equivalent after computation. This paper presents an approach to
encoding Turing Machines into intensional process calculi that is faithful,
reduction preserving, and structurally equivalent. The encoding is demonstrated
in a simple asymmetric concurrent pattern calculus before generalised to
simplify infinite terms, and to show encodings into Concurrent Pattern Calculus
and Psi Calculi."
"We present here the notion of breadth-first signature and its relationship
with numeration system theory. It is the serialisation into an infinite word of
an ordered infinite tree of finite degree. We study which class of languages
corresponds to which class of words and,more specifically, using a known
construction from numeration system theory, we prove that the signature of
rational languages are substitutive sequences."
"By separating the principal acceptance mechanism from the concrete acceptance
condition of a given B\""{u}chi automaton with $n$ states,Schewe presented the
construction of an equivalent deterministic Rabin transition automaton with
$o((1.65n)^n)$ states via \emph{history trees}, which can be simply translated
to a standard Rabin automaton with $o((2.26n)^n)$ states. Apart from the
inherent simplicity, Schewe's construction improved Safra's construction (which
requires $12^nn^{2n}$ states). However, the price that is paid is the use of
$2^{n-1}$ Rabin pairs (instead of $n$ in Safra's construction). Further, by
introducing the \emph{later introduction record} as a record tailored for
ordered trees, deterministic automata with Parity acceptance condition is
constructed which exactly resembles Piterman's determinization with Parity
acceptance condition where the state complexity is $O((n!)^2)$ and the index
complexity is $2n$.In this paper, we improve Schewe's construction to
$2^{\lceil (n-1)/2\rceil}$ Rabin pairs with the same state complexity.
Meanwhile, we give a new determinization construction of Parity automata with
the state complexity being $o(n^2(0.69n\sqrt{n})^n)$ and index complexity being
$n$."
"We consider the problem of learning an unknown context-free grammar when the
only knowledge available and of interest to the learner is about its structural
descriptions with depth at most $\ell.$ The goal is to learn a cover
context-free grammar (CCFG) with respect to $\ell$, that is, a CFG whose
structural descriptions with depth at most $\ell$ agree with those of the
unknown CFG. We propose an algorithm, called $LA^\ell$, that efficiently learns
a CCFG using two types of queries: structural equivalence and structural
membership. We show that $LA^\ell$ runs in time polynomial in the number of
states of a minimal deterministic finite cover tree automaton (DCTA) with
respect to $\ell$. This number is often much smaller than the number of states
of a minimum deterministic finite tree automaton for the structural
descriptions of the unknown grammar."
"We present a new characteristic of a regular ideal language called reset
complexity. We find some bounds on the reset complexity in terms of the state
complexity of a given language. We also compare the reset complexity and the
state complexity for languages related to slowly synchronizing automata and
study uniqueness question for automata yielding the minimum of reset
complexity."
"We study synchronizing automata with the shortest reset words of relatively
large length. First, we refine the Frankl-Pin result on the length of the
shortest words of rank $m$, and the B\'eal, Berlinkov, Perrin, and Steinberg
results on the length of the shortest reset words in one-cluster automata. The
obtained results are useful in computation aimed in extending the class of
small automata for which the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture is verified and discovering
new automata with special properties regarding synchronization."
"A tower between two regular languages is a sequence of strings such that all
strings on odd positions belong to one of the languages, all strings on even
positions belong to the other language, and each string can be embedded into
the next string in the sequence. It is known that if there are towers of any
length, then there also exists an infinite tower. We investigate upper and
lower bounds on the length of finite towers between two regular languages with
respect to the size of the automata representing the languages in the case
there is no infinite tower. This problem is relevant to the separation problem
of regular languages by piecewise testable languages."
"In this paper we associate permitting symbols with rules of Grammars in the
components of cooperating distributed context free hexagonal array grammar
systems as a control mechanism and investigating the generative power of the
resulting systems in the terminal mode. This feature of associating permitting
symbols with rules when extended to patterns in the form of connected arrays
also requires checking of symbols, but this is simpler than usual pattern
matching. The benefit of allowing permitting symbols is that it enables us to
reduce the number of components required in a cooperating distributed hexagonal
array grammar system for generating a set of picture arrays."
"We investigate the problem of checking if a finite-state transducer is robust
to uncertainty in its input. Our notion of robustness is based on the analytic
notion of Lipschitz continuity --- a transducer is K-(Lipschitz) robust if the
perturbation in its output is at most K times the perturbation in its input. We
quantify input and output perturbation using similarity functions. We show that
K-robustness is undecidable even for deterministic transducers. We identify a
class of functional transducers, which admits a polynomial time
automata-theoretic decision procedure for K-robustness. This class includes
Mealy machines and functional letter-to-letter transducers. We also study
K-robustness of nondeterministic transducers. Since a nondeterministic
transducer generates a set of output words for each input word, we quantify
output perturbation using set-similarity functions. We show that K-robustness
of nondeterministic transducers is undecidable, even for letter-to-letter
transducers. We identify a class of set-similarity functions which admit
decidable K-robustness of letter-to-letter transducers."
"Atoms of a (regular) language $L$ were introduced by Brzozowski and Tamm in
2011 as intersections of complemented and uncomplemented quotients of $L$. They
derived tight upper bounds on the complexity of atoms in 2013. In 2014,
Brzozowski and Davies characterized the regular languages meeting these bounds.
To achieve these results, they used the so-called ""atomaton"" of a language,
introduced by Brzozowski and Tamm in 2011. In this note we give an alternative
proof of their characterization, via a purely combinatorial approach."
"We consider the state-minimisation problem for weighted and probabilistic
automata. We provide a numerically stable polynomial-time minimisation
algorithm for weighted automata, with guaranteed bounds on the numerical error
when run with floating-point arithmetic. Our algorithm can also be used for
""lossy"" minimisation with bounded error. We show an application in image
compression. In the second part of the paper we study the complexity of the
minimisation problem for probabilistic automata. We prove that the problem is
NP-hard and in PSPACE, improving a recent EXPTIME-result."
"We study the problem of synchronization of automata with random inputs. We
present a series of automata such that the expected number of steps until
synchronization is exponential in the number of states. At the same time, we
show that the expected number of letters to synchronize any pair of the famous
Cerny automata is at most cubic in the number of states."
"In this paper we describe a new tool, SReach, which solves probabilistic
bounded reachability problems for two classes of stochastic hybrid systems. The
first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The
second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for both
transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to
reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for
large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both
nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. Our approach encodes
stochastic information by using random variables, and combines the randomized
sampling, a $\delta$-complete decision procedure, and statistical tests. SReach
utilizes the $\delta$-complete decision procedure to solve reachability
problems in a sound manner, i.e., it always decides correctly if, for a given
assignment to all random variables, the system actually reaches the unsafe
region. The statistical tests adapted guarantee arbitrary small error bounds
between probabilities estimated by SReach and real ones. Compared to standard
simulation-based methods, our approach supports non-deterministic branching,
increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. We
demonstrate our method's feasibility by applying SReach to three representative
biological models and to additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systems
with multiple probabilistic system parameters."
"Automata over infinite alphabets have recently come to be studied extensively
as potentially useful tools for solving problems in verification and database
theory. One popular model of automata studied is the Class Memory Automata
(CMA), for which the emptiness problem is equivalent to Petri Net Reachability.
We identify a restriction - which we call weakness - of CMA, and show that
their emptiness problem is equivalent to Petri Net Coverability. Further, we
show that in the deterministic case they are closed under all Boolean
operations. We clarify the connections between weak CMA and existing automata
over data languages. We also extend CMA to operate over multiple levels of
nested data values, and show that while these have undecidable emptiness in
general, adding the weakness constraint recovers decidability of emptiness, via
reduction to coverability in well-structured transition systems. We also
examine connections with existing automata over nested data."
"A word is called a reset word for a deterministic finite automaton if it maps
all the states of the automaton to a unique state. Deciding about the existence
of a reset word of a given maximum length for a given automaton is known to be
an NP-complete problem. We prove that it remains NP-complete even if restricted
to Eulerian automata with binary alphabets, as it has been conjectured by
Martyugin (2011)."
"Two languages are separable by a piecewise testable language if and only if
there exists no infinite tower between them. An infinite tower is an infinite
sequence of strings alternating between the two languages such that every
string is a subsequence (scattered substring) of all the strings that follow.
For regular languages represented by nondeterministic finite automata, the
existence of an infinite tower is decidable in polynomial time. In this paper,
we investigate the complexity of a particular method to compute a piecewise
testable separator. We show that it is closely related to the height of maximal
finite towers, and provide the upper and lower bounds with respect to the size
of the given nondeterministic automata. Specifically, we show that the upper
bound is polynomial with respect to the number of states with the cardinality
of the alphabet in the exponent. Concerning the lower bound, we show that
towers of exponential height with respect to the cardinality of the alphabet
exist. Since these towers mostly turn out to be sequences of prefixes, we also
provide a comparison with towers of prefixes."
"We consider finite two-way automata and measure the use of two-way motion by
counting the number of left moves in accepting computations. Restriction of the
automata according to this measure allows us to study in detail the use of
two-way motion for the acceptance of regular languages in terms of state
complexity. The two-way spectrum of a given regular language is introduced.
This quantity reflects the change of size of minimal accepting devices if the
use of two-way motion is increased incrementally. We give examples for spectra,
prove uniform upper and lower bounds and study their sharpness. We also have
state complexity results for two-way automata with uniformly bounded use of
two-way motion."
"Indexed languages are a generalization of context-free languages and form a
proper subset of context-sensitive languages. We propose to generalize to
indexed languages several well known characterizations of context-free
languages: namely, the characterization by rational transductions defined by
Nivat, the Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger theorem, and the logical characterization
proved by Lautemann et al."
"We generalized the class of $k,l$-substitutable languages (Yoshinala, 2008).
Each language in the generalized class is closed under a good substitutability.
The substitutability is defined by a recognizable equivalence relation. We show
the convergence of our generalized learning algorithm. The size of the
characteristic sample is smaller than Yoshinaka's."
"For the whole class of linear term rewriting systems, we define
\emph{bottom-up rewriting} which is a restriction of the usual notion of
rewriting. We show that bottom-up rewriting effectively inverse-preserves
recognizability and analyze the complexity of the underlying construction. The
Bottom-Up class (BU) is, by definition, the set of linear systems for which
every derivation can be replaced by a bottom-up derivation. Membership to BU
turns out to be undecidable, we are thus lead to define more restricted
classes: the classes SBU(k), k in N of Strongly Bottom-Up(k) systems for which
we show that membership is decidable. We define the class of Strongly Bottom-Up
systems by SBU = U_{k in \} SBU(k). We give a polynomial sufficient condition
for a system to be in $\SBU$. The class SBU contains (strictly) several classes
of systems which were already known to inverse preserve recognizability: the
inverse left-basic semi-Thue systems (viewed as unary term rewriting systems),
the linear growing term rewriting systems, the inverse
Linear-Finite-Path-Ordering systems."
"Fuzzy set theory opens new vistas in computability theory and here I show
this by defining a new computational metaphor--the fuzzy chemical metaphor.
This metaphor is an extension of the chemical metaphor. In particular, I
introduce the idea of a state of a system as a solution of fuzzy molecules,
that is molecules that are not just different but rather similar, that react
according to a set of fuzzy reaction rules. These notions become precise by
introducing fuzzy labeled transition systems. Solutions of fuzzy molecules and
fuzzy reaction rules are used to define the general notion of a fuzzy chemical
abstract machine, which is a {\em realization} of the fuzzy chemical metaphor.
Based on the idea that these machines can be used to describe the operational
semantics of process calculi and algebras that include fuzziness as a
fundamental property, I present a toy calculus that is a fuzzy equivalent of
the $\pi$-calculus."
"In this note, we give an alternative proof of the following result. Let p, q
>= 2 be two multiplicatively independent integers. If an infinite set of
integers is both p- and q-recognizable, then it is syndetic. Notice that this
result is needed in the classical proof of the celebrated Cobham?s theorem.
Therefore the aim of this paper is to complete [13] and [1] to obtain an
accessible proof of Cobham?s theorem."
"We show how to represent an interval of real numbers in an abstract
numeration system built on a language that is not necessarily regular. As an
application, we consider representations of real numbers using the Dyck
language. We also show that our framework can be applied to the rational base
numeration systems."
"The historical research line on the algebraic properties of structured CF
languages initiated by McNaughton's Parenthesis Languages has recently
attracted much renewed interest with the Balanced Languages, the Visibly
Pushdown Automata languages (VPDA), the Synchronized Languages, and the
Height-deterministic ones. Such families preserve to a varying degree the basic
algebraic properties of Regular languages: boolean closure, closure under
reversal, under concatenation, and Kleene star. We prove that the VPDA family
is strictly contained within the Floyd Grammars (FG) family historically known
as operator precedence. Languages over the same precedence matrix are known to
be closed under boolean operations, and are recognized by a machine whose pop
or push operations on the stack are purely determined by terminal letters. We
characterize VPDA's as the subclass of FG having a peculiarly structured set of
precedence relations, and balanced grammars as a further restricted case. The
non-counting invariance property of FG has a direct implication for VPDA too."
"The automata arising from the well known conversion of regular expression to
non deterministic automata have rather particular transition graphs. We refer
to them as the Glushkov graphs, to honour his nice expression-to-automaton
algorithmic short cut (On a synthesis algorithm for abstract automata, Ukr.
Matem. Zhurnal, 12(2):147-156, 1960, In Russian). The Glushkov graphs have been
characterized (P. Caron and D. Ziadi, Characterization of Glushkov automata.
Theoret. Comput. Sci., 233(1-2):75-90, 2000) in terms of simple graph
theoretical properties and certain reduction rules. We show how to carry, under
certain restrictions, this characterization over to the weighted Glushkov
graphs. With the weights in a semiring K, they are defined as the transition
Glushkov K-graphs of the Weighted Finite Automata (WFA) obtained by the
generalized Glushkov construction (P. Caron and M. Flouret, Glushkov
construction for series: the non commutative case, Internat. J. Comput. Math.,
80(4):457-472, 2003) from the K-expressions. It works provided that the
semiring K is factorial and the K-expressions are in the so called star normal
form (SNF) of Bruggeman-Klein (Regular expressions into finite automata,
Theoret. Comput. Sci., 120(2):197-213, 1993) The restriction to the factorial
semiring ensures to obtain algorithms. The restriction to the SNF would not be
necessary if every K-expressions were equivalent to some with the same litteral
length, as it is the case for the boolean semiring B but remains an open
question for a general K."
"The past research on the state complexity of operations on regular languages
is examined, and a new approach based on an old method (derivatives of regular
expressions) is presented. Since state complexity is a property of a language,
it is appropriate to define it in formal-language terms as the number of
distinct quotients of the language, and to call it ""quotient complexity"". The
problem of finding the quotient complexity of a language f(K,L) is considered,
where K and L are regular languages and f is a regular operation, for example,
union or concatenation. Since quotients can be represented by derivatives, one
can find a formula for the typical quotient of f(K,L) in terms of the quotients
of K and L. To obtain an upper bound on the number of quotients of f(K,L) all
one has to do is count how many such quotients are possible, and this makes
automaton constructions unnecessary. The advantages of this point of view are
illustrated by many examples. Moreover, new general observations are presented
to help in the estimation of the upper bounds on quotient complexity of regular
operations."
"Using combinatorial properties of incomplete sets in a free monoid we
construct a series of n-state deterministic automata with zero whose shortest
synchronizing word has length n^2/4+n/2-1."
"Probabilistic omega-automata are variants of nondeterministic automata for
infinite words where all choices are resolved by probabilistic distributions.
Acceptance of an infinite input word can be defined in different ways: by
requiring that (i) the probability for the accepting runs is positive (probable
semantics), or (ii) almost all runs are accepting (almost-sure semantics), or
(iii) the probability measure of the accepting runs is greater than a certain
threshold (threshold semantics). The underlying notion of an accepting run can
be defined as for standard omega-automata by means of a Buechi condition or
other acceptance conditions, e.g., Rabin or Streett conditions. In this paper,
we put the main focus on the probable semantics and provide a summary of the
fundamental properties of probabilistic omega-automata concerning
expressiveness, efficiency, and decision problems."
"Directed graphs (DG), interpreted as state transition diagrams, are
traditionally used to represent finite-state automata (FSA). In the context of
formal languages, both FSA and regular expressions (RE) are equivalent in that
they accept and generate, respectively, type-3 (regular) languages. Based on
our previous work, this paper analyzes effects of graph manipulations on
corresponding RE. In this present, starting stage we assume that the DG under
consideration contains no cycles. Graph manipulation is performed by deleting
or inserting of nodes or arcs. Combined and/or multiple application of these
basic operators enable a great variety of transformations of DG (and
corresponding RE) that can be seen as mutants of the original DG (and
corresponding RE). DG are popular for modeling complex systems; however they
easily become intractable if the system under consideration is complex and/or
large. In such situations, we propose to switch to corresponding RE in order to
benefit from their compact format for modeling and algebraic operations for
analysis. The results of the study are of great potential interest to mutation
testing."
"The minimal deterministic finite automaton is generally used to determine
regular languages equality. Antimirov and Mosses proposed a rewrite system for
deciding regular expressions equivalence of which Almeida et al. presented an
improved variant. Hopcroft and Karp proposed an almost linear algorithm for
testing the equivalence of two deterministic finite automata that avoids
minimisation. In this paper we improve the best-case running time, present an
extension of this algorithm to non-deterministic finite automata, and establish
a relationship between this algorithm and the one proposed in Almeida et al. We
also present some experimental comparative results. All these algorithms are
closely related with the recent coalgebraic approach to automata proposed by
Rutten."
"Consider nondeterministic finite automata recognizing base-k positional
notation of numbers. Assume that numbers are read starting from their least
significant digits. It is proved that if two sets of numbers S and T are
represented by nondeterministic automata of m and n states, respectively, then
their sum {s+t | s in S, t in T} is represented by a nondeterministic automaton
with 2mn+2m+2n+1 states. Moreover, this number of states is necessary in the
worst case for all k>=9."
"We consider P systems with a linear membrane structure working on objects
over a unary alphabet using sets of rules resembling homomorphisms. Such a
restricted variant of P systems allows for a unique minimal representation of
the generated unary language and in that way for an effective solution of the
equivalence problem. Moreover, we examine the descriptional complexity of unary
P systems with respect to the number of membranes."
"Recently, some studies linked the computational power of abstract computing
systems based on multiset rewriting to models of Petri nets and the computation
power of these nets to their topology. In turn, the computational power of
these abstract computing devices can be understood by just looking at their
topology, that is, information flow.
  Here we continue this line of research introducing J languages and proving
that they can be accepted by place/transition systems whose underlying net is
composed only of joins. Moreover, we investigate how J languages relate to
other families of formal languages. In particular, we show that every J
language can be accepted by a log n space-bounded non-deterministic Turing
machine with a one-way read-only input. We also show that every J language has
a semilinear Parikh map and that J languages and context-free languages (CFLs)
are incomparable."
"In this paper, we introduce the new concept of state complexity
approximation, which is a further development of state complexity estimation.
We show that this new concept is useful in both of the following two cases: the
exact state complexities are not known and the state complexities have been
obtained but are in incomprehensible form."
"We study the relation between the standard two-way automata and more powerful
devices, namely, two-way finite automata with an additional ""pebble"" movable
along the input tape. Similarly as in the case of the classical two-way
machines, it is not known whether there exists a polynomial trade-off, in the
number of states, between the nondeterministic and deterministic pebble two-way
automata. However, we show that these two machine models are not independent:
if there exists a polynomial trade-off for the classical two-way automata, then
there must also exist a polynomial trade-off for the pebble two-way automata.
Thus, we have an upward collapse (or a downward separation) from the classical
two-way automata to more powerful pebble automata, still staying within the
class of regular languages. The same upward collapse holds for complementation
of nondeterministic two-way machines.
  These results are obtained by showing that each pebble machine can be, by
using suitable inputs, simulated by a classical two-way automaton with a linear
number of states (and vice versa), despite the existing exponential blow-up
between the classical and pebble two-way machines."
"Recently, it has been shown that every recursively enumerable language can be
generated by a scattered context grammar with no more than three nonterminals.
However, in that construction, the maximal number of nonterminals
simultaneously rewritten during a derivation step depends on many factors, such
as the cardinality of the alphabet of the generated language and the structure
of the generated language itself. This paper improves the result by showing
that the maximal number of nonterminals simultaneously rewritten during any
derivation step can be limited by a small constant regardless of other factors."
"A capacity bounded grammar is a grammar whose derivations are restricted by
assigning a bound to the number of every nonterminal symbol in the sentential
forms. In the paper the generative power and closure properties of capacity
bounded grammars and their Petri net controlled counterparts are investigated."
"The results of several papers concerning the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture are
deduced as consequences of a simple idea that I call the averaging trick. This
idea is implicitly used in the literature, but no attempt was made to formalize
the proof scheme axiomatically. Instead, authors axiomatized classes of
automata to which it applies."
"In this note, we give a construction that provides a tight lower bound of
mn-1 for the length of the shortest word in the intersection of two regular
languages with state complexities m and n."
"Several old and recent classes of picture grammars, that variously extend
context-free string grammars in two dimensions, are based on rules that rewrite
arrays of pixels. Such grammars can be unified and extended using a tiling
based approach, whereby the right part of a rule is formalized by means of a
finite set of permitted tiles. We focus on a simple type of tiling,named
regional, and define the corresponding regional tile grammars. They include
both Siromoney's (or Matz's) Kolam grammars and their generalization by Prusa,
as well as Drewes's grid grammars. Regionally defined pictures can be
recognized with polynomial-time complexity by an algorithm extending the CKY
one for strings. Regional tile grammars and languages are strictly included
into our previous tile grammars and languages, and are incomparable with
Giammarresi-Restivo tiling systems (or Wang systems)."
"We consider some questions about formal languages that arise when inverses of
letters, words and languages are defined. The reduced representation of a
language over the free monoid is its unique equivalent representation in the
free group. We show that the class of regular languages is closed under taking
the reduced representation, while the class of context-free languages is not.
We also give an upper bound on the state complexity of the reduced
representation of a regular language, and prove upper and lower bounds on the
length of the shortest reducible string in a regular language. Finally we show
that the set of all words which are equivalent to the words in a regular
language can be nonregular, and that regular languages are not closed under
taking a generalized form of the reduced representation."
"In this paper we study a subclass of pebble automata (PA) for data languages
for which the emptiness problem is decidable. Namely, we introduce the
so-called top view weak PA. Roughly speaking, top view weak PA are weak PA
where the equality test is performed only between the data values seen by the
two most recently placed pebbles. The emptiness problem for this model is
decidable. We also show that it is robust: alternating, nondeterministic and
deterministic top view weak PA have the same recognition power. Moreover, this
model is strong enough to accept all data languages expressible in Linear
Temporal Logic with the future-time operators, augmented with one register
freeze quantifier."
"In this paper, we propose a procedure that given an integer reset timed
automaton (IRTA) ${\cal A}$, produces a language equivalent deterministic one
clock IRTA ${\cal B}$ whose size is at most doubly exponential in the size of
${\cal A}$. We prove that this bound on the number of locations is tight.
Further, if integer resets are used in stopwatch automata, a subclass of
stopwatch automata which is closed under all boolean operations and for which
reachability is decidable is obtained."
"Leftist grammars [Motwani et al., STOC 2000] are special semi-Thue systems
where symbols can only insert or erase to their left. We develop a theory of
leftist grammars seen as word transformers as a tool toward rigorous analyses
of their computational power. Our main contributions in this first paper are
(1) constructions proving that leftist transformations are closed under
compositions and transitive closures, and (2) a proof that bounded reachability
is NP-complete even for leftist grammars with acyclic rules."
"This paper is the second part of a series of two papers dealing with bulking:
a way to define quasi-order on cellular automata by comparing space-time
diagrams up to rescaling. In the present paper, we introduce three notions of
simulation between cellular automata and study the quasi-order structures
induced by these simulation relations on the whole set of cellular automata.
Various aspects of these quasi-orders are considered (induced equivalence
relations, maximum elements, induced orders, etc) providing several formal
tools allowing to classify cellular automata."
"A regular language L is said to be cellular if there exists a 1-dimensional
cellular automaton CA such that L is the language consisting of the finite
blocks associated with CA. It is shown that cellularity of a regular language
is decidable using a new characterization of cellular languages formulated by
Freiling, Goldstein and Moews and implied by a deep result of Boyle in symbolic
dynamics."
"For several semirings S, two weighted finite automata with multiplicities in
S are equivalent if and only if they can be connected by a chain of
simulations. Such a semiring S is called ""proper"". It is known that the Boolean
semiring, the semiring of natural numbers, the ring of integers, all finite
commutative positively ordered semirings and all fields are proper. The
semiring S is Noetherian if every subsemimodule of a finitely generated
S-semimodule is finitely generated. First, it is shown that all Noetherian
semirings and thus all commutative rings and all finite semirings are proper.
Second, the tropical semiring is shown not to be proper. So far there has not
been any example of a semiring that is not proper."
"In this paper we study the fault codiagnosis problem for discrete event
systems given by finite automata (FA) and timed systems given by timed automata
(TA). We provide a uniform characterization of codiagnosability for FA and TA
which extends the necessary and sufficient condition that characterizes
diagnosability. We also settle the complexity of the codiagnosability problems
both for FA and TA and show that codiagnosability is PSPACE-complete in both
cases. For FA this improves on the previously known bound (EXPTIME) and for TA
it is a new result. Finally we address the codiagnosis problem for TA under
bounded resources and show it is 2EXPTIME-complete."
"In this paper, we review some recent results about the use of dynamic
observers for fault diagnosis of discrete event systems. Fault diagnosis
consists in synthesizing a diagnoser that observes a given plant and identifies
faults in the plant as soon as possible after their occurrence. Existing
literature on this problem has considered the case of fixed static observers,
where the set of observable events is fixed and does not change during
execution of the system. In this paper, we consider dynamic observers: an
observer can ""switch"" sensors on or off, thus dynamically changing the set of
events it wishes to observe. It is known that checking diagnosability (i.e.,
whether a given observer is capable of identifying faults) can be solved in
polynomial time for static observers, and we show that the same is true for
dynamic ones. We also solve the problem of dynamic observers' synthesis and
prove that a most permissive observer can be computed in doubly exponential
time, using a game-theoretic approach. We further investigate optimization
problems for dynamic observers and define a notion of cost of an observer."
"This paper solves an open problem concerning the generative power of
nonerasing context-free rewriting systems using a simple mechanism for checking
for context dependencies, in the literature known as semi-conditional grammars
of degree (1,1). In these grammars, two nonterminal symbols are attached to
each context-free production, and such a production is applicable if one of the
two attached symbols occurs in the current sentential form, while the other
does not. Specifically, this paper demonstrates that the family of languages
generated by semi-conditional grammars of degree (1,1) coincides with the
family of random context languages. In addition, it shows that the normal form
proved by Mayer for random context grammars with erasing productions holds for
random context grammars without erasing productions, too. It also discusses two
possible definitions of the relation of the direct derivation step used in the
literature."
"We establish the existence of optimal scheduling strategies for time-bounded
reachability in continuous-time Markov decision processes, and of co-optimal
strategies for continuous-time Markov games. Furthermore, we show that optimal
control does not only exist, but has a surprisingly simple structure: The
optimal schedulers from our proofs are deterministic and timed-positional, and
the bounded time can be divided into a finite number of intervals, in which the
optimal strategies are positional. That is, we demonstrate the existence of
finite optimal control. Finally, we show that these pleasant properties of
Markov decision processes extend to the more general class of continuous-time
Markov games, and that both early and late schedulers show this behaviour."
"Pumping lemmas are created to prove that given languages are not belong to
certain language classes. There are several known pumping lemmas for the whole
class and some special classes of the context-free languages. In this paper we
prove new, interesting pumping lemmas for special linear and context-free
language classes. Some of them can be used to pump regular languages in two
place simultaneously. Other lemma can be used to pump context-free languages in
arbitrary many places."
"Operator precedence grammars define a classical Boolean and deterministic
context-free family (called Floyd languages or FLs). FLs have been shown to
strictly include the well-known visibly pushdown languages, and enjoy the same
nice closure properties. We introduce here Floyd automata, an equivalent
operational formalism for defining FLs. This also permits to extend the class
to deal with infinite strings to perform for instance model checking."
"In this paper we give three examples of expending patterns defined by
hyperbolic cellular automata whose growth seems to be very similar to the
growth of colonies of bacteria."
"The quotient complexity, also known as state complexity, of a regular
language is the number of distinct left quotients of the language. The quotient
complexity of an operation is the maximal quotient complexity of the language
resulting from the operation, as a function of the quotient complexities of the
operands. The class of star-free languages is the smallest class containing the
finite languages and closed under boolean operations and concatenation. We
prove that the tight bounds on the quotient complexities of union,
intersection, difference, symmetric difference, concatenation, and star for
star-free languages are the same as those for regular languages, with some
small exceptions, whereas the bound for reversal is 2^n-1."
"Given a formal language L specified in various ways, we consider the problem
of determining if L is nonempty. If L is indeed nonempty, we find upper and
lower bounds on the length of the shortest string in L."
"The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its
syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of the class of
regular languages is the maximal syntactic complexity of languages in that
class, taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of these languages. We
study the syntactic complexity of prefix-, suffix-, bifix-, and factor-free
regular languages. We prove that $n^{n-2}$ is a tight upper bound for
prefix-free regular languages. We present properties of the syntactic
semigroups of suffix-, bifix-, and factor-free regular languages, conjecture
tight upper bounds on their size to be $(n-1)^{n-2}+(n-2)$, $(n-1)^{n-3} +
(n-2)^{n-3} + (n-3)2^{n-3}$, and $(n-1)^{n-3} + (n-3)2^{n-3} + 1$,
respectively, and exhibit languages with these syntactic complexities."
"Combinatorial properties of maximal repetitions (runs) in formal words are
studied. We classify all maximal repetitions in a word as primary and secondary
where the set of all primary repetitions determines all the other repetitons in
the word. Essential combinatorial properties of primary repetitions are
established."
"We consider context-free languages equipped with the lexicographic ordering.
We show that when the lexicographic ordering of a context-free language is
scattered, then its Hausdorff rank is less than $\omega^\omega$. As a corollary
of this result we obtain that an ordinal is the order type of a well-ordered
context-free language iff it is less than $\omega^{\omega^\omega}$."
"In this paper we describe an approach to finding the shortest reset word of a
finite synchronizing automaton by using a SAT solver. We use this approach to
perform an experimental study of the length of the shortest reset word of a
finite synchronizing automaton. The largest automata we considered had 100
states. The results of the experiments allow us to formulate a hypothesis that
the length of the shortest reset word of a random finite automaton with $n$
states and 2 input letters with high probability is sublinear with respect to
$n$ and can be estimated as $1.95 n^{0.55}.$"
"We give the avoidance indices (morphic and antimorphic) for all unary
patterns with involution."
"We give lower bounds on the growth rate of Dejean words, i.e. minimally
repetitive words, over a k-letter alphabet, for k=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Put
together with the known upper bounds, we estimate these growth rates with the
precision of 0,005. As an consequence, we establish the exponential growth of
the number of Dejean words over a k-letter alphabet, for k=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."
"Li and Pedrycz [Y. M. Li, W. Pedrycz, Fuzzy finite automata and fuzzy regular
expressions with membership values in lattice ordered monoids, Fuzzy Sets and
Systems 156 (2005) 68--92] have proved fundamental results that provide
different equivalent ways to represent fuzzy languages with membership values
in a lattice-ordered monoid, and generalize the well-known results of the
classical theory of formal languages. In particular, they have shown that a
fuzzy language over an integral lattice-ordered monoid can be represented by a
fuzzy regular expression if and only if it can be recognized by a fuzzy finite
automaton. However, they did not give any effective method for constructing an
equivalent fuzzy finite automaton from a given fuzzy regular expression. In
this paper we provide such an effective method. Transforming scalars appearing
in a fuzzy regular expression {\alpha} into letters of the new extended
alphabet, we convert the fuzzy regular expression {\alpha} to an ordinary
regular expression {\alpha}_{R}. Then, starting from an arbitrary
nondeterministic finite automaton A that recognizes the language ||{\alpha}_R||
represented by the regular expression {\alpha}_R, we construct fuzzy finite
automata A_{\alpha} and A_{\alpha}^r with the same or even less number of
states than the automaton A, which recognize the fuzzy language ||{\alpha}||
represented by the fuzzy regular expression {\alpha}. The starting
nondeterministic finite automaton A can be obtained from {\alpha}_R using any
of the well-known constructions for converting regular expressions to
nondeterministic finite automata, such as Glushkov-McNaughton-Yamada's position
automaton, Brzozowski's derivative automaton, Antimirov's partial derivative
automaton, or Ilie-Yu's follow automaton."
"We study regular expressions that use variables, or parameters, which are
interpreted as alphabet letters. We consider two classes of languages denoted
by such expressions: under the possibility semantics, a word belongs to the
language if it is denoted by some regular expression obtained by replacing
variables with letters; under the certainly semantics, the word must be denoted
by every such expression. Such languages are regular, and we show that they
naturally arise in several applications such as querying graph databases and
program analysis. As the main contribution of the paper, we provide a complete
characterization of the complexity of the main computational problems related
to such languages: nonemptiness, universality, containment, membership, as well
as the problem of constructing NFAs capturing such languages. We also look at
the extension when domains of variables could be arbitrary regular languages,
and show that under the certainty semantics, languages remain regular and the
complexity of the main computational problems does not change."
"We consider probabilistic automata on infinite words with acceptance defined
by parity conditions. We consider three qualitative decision problems: (i) the
positive decision problem asks whether there is a word that is accepted with
positive probability; (ii) the almost decision problem asks whether there is a
word that is accepted with probability 1; and (iii) the limit decision problem
asks whether for every epsilon > 0 there is a word that is accepted with
probability at least 1 - epsilon. We unify and generalize several decidability
results for probabilistic automata over infinite words, and identify a robust
(closed under union and intersection) subclass of probabilistic automata for
which all the qualitative decision problems are decidable for parity
conditions. We also show that if the input words are restricted to lasso shape
(regular) words, then the positive and almost problems are decidable for all
probabilistic automata with parity conditions. For most decidable problems we
show an optimal PSPACE-complete complexity bound."
"In this paper we consider a general way of constructing profinite struc-
tures based on a given framework - a countable family of objects and a
countable family of recognisers (e.g. formulas). The main theorem states:
  A subset of a family of recognisable sets is a lattice if and only if it is
definable by a family of profinite equations.
  This result extends Theorem 5.2 from [GGEP08] expressed only for finite words
and morphisms to finite monoids. One of the applications of our theorem is the
situation where objects are finite relational structures and recognisers are
first order sentences. In that setting a simple characterisation of lattices of
first order formulas arise."
"A weighted automaton is functional if any two accepting runs on the same
finite word have the same value. In this paper, we investigate functional
weighted automata for four different measures: the sum, the mean, the
discounted sum of weights along edges and the ratio between rewards and costs.
On the positive side, we show that functionality is decidable for the four
measures. Furthermore, the existential and universal threshold problems, the
language inclusion problem and the equivalence problem are all decidable when
the weighted automata are functional. On the negative side, we also study the
quantitative extension of the realizability problem and show that it is
undecidable for sum, mean and ratio. We finally show how to decide whether the
language associated with a given functional automaton can be defined with a
deterministic one, for sum, mean and discounted sum. The results on
functionality and determinizability are expressed for the more general class of
functional group automata. This allows one to formulate within the same
framework new results related to discounted sum automata and known results on
sum and mean automata. Ratio automata do not fit within this general scheme and
different techniques are required to decide functionality."
"The class of Church-Rosser congruential languages has been introduced by
McNaughton, Narendran, and Otto in 1988. A language L is Church-Rosser
congruential (belongs to CRCL), if there is a finite, confluent, and
length-reducing semi-Thue system S such that L is a finite union of congruence
classes modulo S. To date, it is still open whether every regular language is
in CRCL. In this paper, we show that every star-free language is in CRCL. In
fact, we prove a stronger statement: For every star-free language L there
exists a finite, confluent, and subword-reducing semi-Thue system S such that
the total number of congruence classes modulo S is finite and such that L is a
union of congruence classes modulo S. The construction turns out to be
effective."
"Reaction systems are a formal model that has been introduced to investigate
the interactive behaviors of biochemical reactions. Based on the formal
framework of reaction systems, we propose new computing models called reaction
automata that feature (string) language acceptors with multiset manipulation as
a computing mechanism, and show that reaction automata are computationally
Turing universal. Further, some subclasses of reaction automata with space
complexity are investigated and their language classes are compared to the ones
in the Chomsky hierarchy."
"The synchronization problem is investigated for the class of locally strongly
transitive automata introduced in a previous work of the authors. Some
extensions of this problem related to the notions of stable set and word of
minimal rank of an automaton are studied. An application to synchronizing
colorings of aperiodic graphs with a Hamiltonian path is also considered."
"In this paper we propose a biomolecular implementation of the push-down
automaton (one of theoretical models of computing device with unbounded memory)
using DNA molecules. The idea of this improved implementation was inspired by
Cavaliere et al. (2005)."
"We revisit the problem of deciding whether a given string is uniquely
decodable from its bigram counts by means of a finite automaton. An efficient
algorithm for constructing a polynomial-size nondeterministic finite automaton
that decides unique decodability is given. Conversely, we show that the minimum
deterministic finite automaton for deciding unique decodability has at least
exponentially many states in alphabet size."
"This paper proves a long standing conjecture in formal language theory. It
shows that all regular languages are Church-Rosser congruential. The class of
Church-Rosser congruential languages was introduced by McNaughton, Narendran,
and Otto in 1988. A language L is Church-Rosser congruential, if there exists a
finite confluent, and length-reducing semi-Thue system S such that L is a
finite union of congruence classes modulo S. It was known that there are
deterministic linear context-free languages which are not Church-Rosser
congruential, but on the other hand it was strongly believed that all regular
language are of this form. Actually, this paper proves a more general result."
"In this paper, we construct a family of weakly universal rotation invariant
cellular automaton for all grids $\{p,3\}$ of the hyperbolic plane for $p\geq
13$. The scheme is general for $p\geq 17$ and for $13\leq p<17$, we give such a
cellular automaton for $p=13$, which is enough. Also, an important property of
this family is that the set of cells of the cellular automaton which are
subject to changes is actually a planar set. The problem for $p<13$ for a truly
planar construction is still open. The best result, for $p=7$, is four states
and was obtained by the same author."
"Weak bisimilarity is a distribution-based equivalence notion for Markov
automata. It has gained some popularity as the coarsest reasonable behavioural
equivalence on Markov automata. This paper studies a strictly coarser notion:
Late weak bisimilarity enjoys valuable properties if restricting to important
subclasses of schedulers: Trace distribution equivalence is implied for partial
information schedulers, and compositionality is preserved by distributed
schedulers. The intersection of the two scheduler classes thus spans a coarser
and still reasonable compositional theory of Markov automata."
"This report presents an algorithm to statically schedule live and strongly
connected Marked Graphs (MG). The proposed algorithm computes the best
execution where the execution rate is maximal and place sizes are minimal. The
proposed algorithm provides transition schedules represented as binary words.
These words are chosen to be balanced. The contributions of this paper is the
proposed algorithm itself along with the characterization of the best execution
of any MG."
"Synthesis of correct by design systems from specification has recently
attracted much attention. The theoretical results imply that this problem is
highly intractable, e.g., synthesizing a system is 2EXPTIME-complete for an LTL
specification, and EXPTIME-complete for a CTL specification. However, an
argument against it is that the temporal specification is highly compact, and
the complexity reflects the large size of the system constructed. In that
respect, the complexity should, perhaps, be specified relative to the size of
the minimal satisfying system. A careful observation reveals that the size of
the system is presented in such arguments as the size of its state space. This
view is a bit nonstandard, in the sense that the state space can be
exponentially larger than the size of a reasonable implementation such as a
circuit or a program. Although this alternative measure of the size of the
synthesized system is more intuitive (e.g., this is the standard way model
checking problems are measured), research on synthesis has so far stayed with
measuring the system in terms of the explicit state space. This raises the
question of whether or not there always exists a small system. In this paper,
we show that this is the case if, and only if, PSPACE = EXPTIME."
"We prove that the finite condensation rank (FC-rank) of the lexicographic
ordering of a context-free language is strictly less than $\omega^\omega$."
"Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) are a formalism that can describe all
deterministic context-free languages through a set of rules that specify a
top-down parser for some language. PEGs are easy to use, and there are
efficient implementations of PEG libraries in several programming languages.
  A frequently missed feature of PEGs is left recursion, which is commonly used
in Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) to encode left-associative operations. We
present a simple conservative extension to the semantics of PEGs that gives
useful meaning to direct and indirect left-recursive rules, and show that our
extensions make it easy to express left-recursive idioms from CFGs in PEGs,
with similar results. We prove the conservativeness of these extensions, and
also prove that they work with any left-recursive PEG.
  PEGs can also be compiled to programs in a low-level parsing machine. We
present an extension to the semantics of the operations of this parsing machine
that let it interpret left-recursive PEGs, and prove that this extension is
correct with regards to our semantics for left-recursive PEGs."
"We study the state complexity of boolean operations, concatenation and star
with one or two of the argument languages reversed. We derive tight upper
bounds for the symmetric differences and differences of such languages. We
prove that the previously discovered bounds for union, intersection,
concatenation and star of such languages can all be met by the recently
introduced universal witnesses and their variants."
"We study the state complexity of boolean operations and product
(concatenation, catenation) combined with star. We derive tight upper bounds
for the symmetric differences and differences of two languages, one or both of
which are starred, and for the product of two starred languages. We prove that
the previously discovered bounds for the union and the intersection of
languages with one or two starred arguments, for the product of two languages
one of which is starred, and for the star of the product of two languages can
all be met by the recently introduced universal witnesses and their variants."
"The \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture states that for every synchronizing automaton
with n states there exists a reset word of length not exceeding (n-11)^2. We
prove this conjecture for a class of automata preserving certain properties of
intervals of a directed graph. Our result unifies and generalizes some earlier
results obtained by other authors."
"The pumping lemma for context-free languages is a result about pushdown
automata which is strikingly similar to the well-known pumping lemma for
regular languages. However, though the lemma for regular languages is simply
proved by using the pigeonhole principle on deterministic automata, the lemma
for pushdown automata is proven through an equivalence with context-free
languages and through the more powerful Ogden's lemma. We present here a proof
of the pumping lemma for context-free languages which relies on pushdown
automata instead of context-free grammars."
"In this paper, we consider the problem of translating LTL formulas to Buechi
automata. We first translate the given LTL formula into a special
disjuctive-normal form (DNF). The formula will be part of the state, and its
DNF normal form specifies the atomic properties that should hold immediately
(labels of the transitions) and the formula that should hold afterwards (the
corresponding successor state). Surprisingly, if the given formula is
Until-free or Release-free, the Buechi automaton can be obtained directly in
this manner. For a general formula, the construction is slightly involved: an
additional component will be needed for each formula that helps us to identify
the set of accepting states. Notably, our construction is an on-the-fly
construction, and the resulting Buechi automaton has in worst case 2^{2n+1}
states where n denotes the number of subformulas. Moreover, it has a better
bound 2^{n+1} when the formula is Until- (or Release-) free."
"This article proposes novel off-line test generation techniques from
non-deterministic timed automata with inputs and outputs (TAIOs) in the formal
framework of the tioco conformance theory. In this context, a first problem is
the determinization of TAIOs, which is necessary to foresee next enabled
actions after an observable trace, but is in general impossible because not all
timed automata are determinizable. This problem is solved thanks to an
approximate determinization using a game approach. The algorithm performs an
io-abstraction which preserves the tioco conformance relation and thus
guarantees the soundness of generated test cases. A second problem is the
selection of test cases from a TAIO specification. The selection here relies on
a precise description of timed behaviors to be tested which is carried out by
expressive test purposes modeled by a generalization of TAIOs. Finally, an
algorithm is described which generates test cases in the form of TAIOs equipped
with verdicts, using a symbolic co-reachability analysis guided by the test
purpose. Properties of test cases are then analyzed with respect to the
precision of the approximate determinization: when determinization is exact,
which is the case on known determinizable classes, in addition to soundness,
properties characterizing the adequacy of test cases verdicts are also
guaranteed."
"We investigate the (non)-existence of universal automata for some classes of
automata, such as finite automata and pushdown automata, and in particular the
influence of the representation and encoding function. An alternative approach,
using transition systems, is presented too."
"We study variants of regular infinite games where the strict alternation of
moves between the two players is subject to modifications. The second player
may postpone a move for a finite number of steps, or, in other words, exploit
in his strategy some lookahead on the moves of the opponent. This captures
situations in distributed systems, e.g. when buffers are present in
communication or when signal transmission between components is deferred. We
distinguish strategies with different degrees of lookahead, among them being
the continuous and the bounded lookahead strategies. In the first case the
lookahead is of finite possibly unbounded size, whereas in the second case it
is of bounded size. We show that for regular infinite games the solvability by
continuous strategies is decidable, and that a continuous strategy can always
be reduced to one of bounded lookahead. Moreover, this lookahead is at most
doubly exponential in the size of a given parity automaton recognizing the
winning condition. We also show that the result fails for non-regular
gamesxwhere the winning condition is given by a context-free omega-language."
"Alloy is an increasingly popular lightweight specification language based on
relational logic. Alloy models can be automatically verified within a bounded
scope using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. Since false assertions can usually be
disproved using small counter-examples, this approach suffices for most
applications. Unfortunately, it can sometimes lead to a false sense of
security, and in critical applications a more traditional unbounded proof may
be required. The automatic theorem prover Prover9 has been shown to be
particularly effective for proving theorems of relation algebras [7], a
quantifier-free (or point-free) axiomatization of a fragment of relational
logic. In this paper we propose a translation from Alloy specifications to fork
algebras (an extension of relation algebras with the same expressive power as
relational logic) which enables their unbounded verification in Prover9. This
translation covers not only logic assertions, but also the structural aspects
(namely type declarations), and was successfully implemented and applied to
several examples."
"We show that the local period at position n in a characteristic Sturmian word
can be given in terms of the Ostrowski representation for n + 1."
"We describe a minimization procedure for nondeterministic B\""uchi automata
(NBA). For an automaton A another automaton A_min with the minimal number of
states is learned with the help of a SAT-solver.
  This is done by successively computing automata A' that approximate A in the
sense that they accept a given finite set of positive examples and reject a
given finite set of negative examples. In the course of the procedure these
example sets are successively increased. Thus, our method can be seen as an
instance of a generic learning algorithm based on a ""minimally adequate
teacher"" in the sense of Angluin.
  We use a SAT solver to find an NBA for given sets of positive and negative
examples. We use complementation via construction of deterministic parity
automata to check candidates computed in this manner for equivalence with A.
Failure of equivalence yields new positive or negative examples. Our method
proved successful on complete samplings of small automata and of quite some
examples of bigger automata.
  We successfully ran the minimization on over ten thousand automata with
mostly up to ten states, including the complements of all possible automata
with two states and alphabet size three and discuss results and runtimes;
single examples had over 100 states."
"We propose a new extension of higher-order pushdown automata, which allows to
use an infinite alphabet. The new automata recognize languages of data words
(instead of normal words), which beside each its letter from a finite alphabet
have a data value from an infinite alphabet. Those data values can be loaded to
the stack of the automaton, and later compared with some farther data values on
the input. Our main purpose for introducing these automata is that they may
help in analyzing normal automata (without data). As an example, we give a
proof that deterministic automata with collapse can recognize more languages
than deterministic automata without collapse. This proof is simpler than in the
no-data case. We also state a hypothesis how the new automaton model can be
related to the original model of higher-order pushdown automata."
"The paper gives an example of a tree language G that is recognised by an
unambiguous parity automaton and is analytic-complete as a set in Cantor space.
This already shows that the unambiguous languages are topologically more
complex than the deterministic ones, that are all coanalytic.
  Using set G as a building block we construct an unambiguous language that is
topologically harder than any countable boolean combination of analytic and
coanalytic sets. In particular the language is harder than any set in
difference hierarchy of analytic sets considered by O.Finkel and P.Simonnet in
the context of nondeterministic automata."
"We investigate the conversion of one-way nondeterministic finite automata and
context-free grammars into Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way deterministic
finite automata, from a descriptional complexity point of view.
  We prove that for each one-way nondeterministic automaton with $n$ states
there exist Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way deterministic automata with
$e^{O(\sqrt{n \ln n})}$ and $p(n)$ states, respectively, where $p(n)$ is a
polynomial. Furthermore, these costs are tight. In contrast, if all the words
accepted by the given automaton contain at least two different letters, then a
Parikh equivalent one-way deterministic automaton with a polynomial number of
states can be found.
  Concerning context-free grammars, we prove that for each grammar in Chomsky
normal form with h variables there exist Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way
deterministic automata with $2^{O(h^2)}$ and $2^{O(h)}$ states, respectively.
Even these bounds are tight."
"The aim of this paper is to design a theoretical framework that allows us to
perform the computation of regular expression derivatives through a space of
generic structures. Thanks to this formalism, the main properties of regular
expression derivation, such as the finiteness of the set of derivatives, need
only be stated and proved one time, at the top level. Moreover, it is shown how
to construct an alternating automaton associated with the derivation of a
regular expression in this general framework. Finally, Brzozowski's derivation
and Antimirov's derivation turn out to be a particular case of this general
scheme and it is shown how to construct a DFA, a NFA and an AFA for both of
these derivations."
"The theory of regular cost functions is a quantitative extension to the
classical notion of regularity. A cost function associates to each input a
non-negative integer value (or infinity), as opposed to languages which only
associate to each input the two values ""inside"" and ""outside"". This theory is a
continuation of the works on distance automata and similar models. These models
of automata have been successfully used for solving the star-height problem,
the finite power property, the finite substitution problem, the relative
inclusion star-height problem and the boundedness problem for monadic-second
order logic over words. Our notion of regularity can be -- as in the classical
theory of regular languages -- equivalently defined in terms of automata,
expressions, algebraic recognisability, and by a variant of the monadic
second-order logic. These equivalences are strict extensions of the
corresponding classical results. The present paper introduces the cost monadic
logic, the quantitative extension to the notion of monadic second-order logic
we use, and show that some problems of existence of bounds are decidable for
this logic. This is achieved by introducing the corresponding algebraic
formalism: stabilisation monoids."
"Linear extended top-down tree transducers (or synchronous tree-substitution
grammars) are popular formal models of tree transformations. The expressive
power of compositions of such transducers with and without regular look-ahead
is investigated. In particular, the restrictions of nondeletion,
epsilon-freeness, and strictness are considered. The composition hierarchy
turns out to be finite for all epsilon-free (all rules consume input) variants
of these transducers except for nondeleting epsilon-free linear extended
top-down tree transducers. The least number of transducers needed for the full
expressive power of arbitrary compositions is presented. In all remaining cases
(including nondeleting epsilon-free linear extended top-down tree transducers)
the composition hierarchy does not collapse."
"Algorithms which compute the coarsest simulation preorder are generally
designed on Kripke structures. Only in a second time they are extended to
labelled transition systems. By doing this, the size of the alphabet appears in
general as a multiplicative factor to both time and space complexities. Let $Q$
denotes the state space, $\rightarrow$ the transition relation, $\Sigma$ the
alphabet and $P_{sim}$ the partition of $Q$ induced by the coarsest simulation
equivalence. In this paper, we propose a base algorithm which minimizes, since
the first stages of its design, the incidence of the size of the alphabet in
both time and space complexities. This base algorithm, inspired by the one of
Paige and Tarjan in 1987 for bisimulation and the one of Ranzato and Tapparo in
2010 for simulation, is then derived in three versions. One of them has the
best bit space complexity up to now,
$O(|P_{sim}|^2+|{\rightarrow}|.\log|{\rightarrow}|)$, while another one has the
best time complexity up to now, $O(|P_{sim}|.|{\rightarrow}|)$. Note the
absence of the alphabet in these complexities. A third version happens to be a
nice compromise between space and time since it runs in
$O(b.|P_{sim}|.|{\rightarrow}|)$ time, with $b$ a branching factor generally
far below $|P_{sim}|$, and uses
$O(|P_{sim}|^2.\log|P_{sim}|+|{\rightarrow}|.\log|{\rightarrow}|)$ bits."
"We present a report from a series of experiments involving computation of the
shortest reset words for automata with small number of states. We confirm that
the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture is true for all automata with at most 11 states on
2 letters. Also some new interesting results were obtained, including the third
gap in the distribution of the shortest reset words and new slowly
synchronizing classes of automata."
"We prove that language equivalence of deterministic one-counter automata is
NL-complete. This improves the superpolynomial time complexity upper bound
shown by Valiant and Paterson in 1975. Our main contribution is to prove that
two deterministic one-counter automata are inequivalent if and only if they can
be distinguished by a word of length polynomial in the size of the two input
automata."
"\omega-languages are becoming more and more relevant nowadays when most
applications are 'ever-running'. Recent literature, mainly under the motivation
of widening the application of model checking techniques, extended the analysis
of these languages from the simple regular ones to various classes of languages
with 'visible syntax structure', such as visibly pushdown languages (VPLs).
Operator precedence languages (OPLs), instead, were originally defined to
support deterministic parsing and, though seemingly unrelated, exhibit
interesting relations with these classes of languages: OPLs strictly include
VPLs, enjoy all relevant closure properties and have been characterized by a
suitable automata family and a logic notation. In this paper we introduce
operator precedence \omega-languages (\omega OPLs), investigating various
acceptance criteria and their closure properties. Whereas some properties are
natural extensions of those holding for regular languages, others required
novel investigation techniques. Application-oriented examples show the gain in
expressiveness and verifiability offered by \omega OPLs w.r.t. smaller classes."
"It is decidable if a set of numbers, whose representation in a base b is a
regular language, is ultimately periodic. This was established by Honkala in
1986.
  We give here a structural description of minimal automata that accept an
ultimately periodic set of numbers. We then show that it can verified in linear
time if a given minimal automaton meets this description.
  This thus yields a O(n log(n)) procedure for deciding whether a general
deterministic automaton accepts an ultimately periodic set of numbers."
"The aim of this paper is to design the polynomial construction of a finite
recognizer for hairpin completions of regular languages. This is achieved by
considering completions as new expression operators and by applying derivation
techniques to the associated extended expressions called hairpin expressions.
More precisely, we extend partial derivation of regular expressions to
two-sided partial derivation of hairpin expressions and we show how to deduce a
recognizer for a hairpin expression from its two-sided derived term automaton,
providing an alternative proof of the fact that hairpin completions of regular
languages are linear context-free."
"We study a model of one-way quantum automaton where only measurement
operations are allowed ($\mon$). We give an algebraic characterization of
$\lmo(\Sigma)$, showing that the syntactic monoids of the languages in
$\lmo(\Sigma)$ are exactly the $J$-trivial literally idempotent syntactic
monoids, where $J$ is the Green's relation determined by two-sided ideals. We
also prove that $\lmo(\Sigma)$ coincides with the literal variety of literally
idempotent piecewise testable regular languages. This allows us to prove the
existence of a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a regular
language belongs to $\lmo(\Sigma)$ and to discuss definability issues in terms
of the existential first-order logic $\Sigma_1[<]$ and the linear temporal
logic without the next operator LTLWN."
"We examine the NFA minimization problem in terms of atomic NFA's, that is,
NFA's in which the right language of every state is a union of atoms, where the
atoms of a regular language are non-empty intersections of complemented and
uncomplemented left quotients of the language. We characterize all reduced
atomic NFA's of a given language, that is, those NFA's that have no equivalent
states. Using atomic NFA's, we formalize Sengoku's approach to NFA minimization
and prove that his method fails to find all minimal NFA's. We also formulate
the Kameda-Weiner NFA minimization in terms of quotients and atoms."
"We propose a generalisation of concurrent Kleene algebra \cite{Hoa09} that
can take account of probabilistic effects in the presence of concurrency. The
algebra is proved sound with respect to a model of automata modulo a variant of
rooted $\eta$-simulation equivalence. Applicability is demonstrated by
algebraic treatments of two examples: algebraic may testing and Rabin's
solution to the choice coordination problem."
"The state complexity of basic operations on finite languages (considering
complete DFAs) has been in studied the literature. In this paper we study the
incomplete (deterministic) state and transition complexity on finite languages
of boolean operations, concatenation, star, and reversal. For all operations we
give tight upper bounds for both description measures. We correct the published
state complexity of concatenation for complete DFAs and provide a tight upper
bound for the case when the right automaton is larger than the left one. For
all binary operations the tightness is proved using family languages with a
variable alphabet size. In general the operational complexities depend not only
on the complexities of the operands but also on other refined measures."
"Complementation of B\""uchi automata, required for checking automata
containment, is of major theoretical and practical interest in formal
verification. We consider two recent approaches to complementation. The first
is the rank-based approach of Kupferman and Vardi, which operates over a DAG
that embodies all runs of the automaton. This approach is based on the
observation that the vertices of this DAG can be ranked in a certain way,
termed an odd ranking, iff all runs are rejecting. The second is the
slice-based approach of K\""ahler and Wilke. This approach tracks levels of
""split trees"" - run trees in which only essential information about the history
of each run is maintained. While the slice-based construction is conceptually
simple, the complementing automata it generates are exponentially larger than
those of the recent rank-based construction of Schewe, and it suffers from the
difficulty of symbolically encoding levels of split trees. In this work we
reformulate the slice-based approach in terms of run DAGs and preorders over
states. In doing so, we begin to draw parallels between the rank-based and
slice-based approaches. Through deeper analysis of the slice-based approach, we
strongly restrict the nondeterminism it generates. We are then able to employ
the slice-based approach to provide a new odd ranking, called a retrospective
ranking, that is different from the one provided by Kupferman and Vardi. This
new ranking allows us to construct a deterministic-in-the-limit rank-based
automaton with a highly restricted transition function. Further, by phrasing
the slice-based approach in terms of ranks, our approach affords a simple
symbolic encoding and achieves the tight bound of Schewe's construction"
"This paper is concerned with the computational complexity of equivalence and
minimisation for automata with transition weights in the field Q of rational
numbers. We use polynomial identity testing and the Isolation Lemma to obtain
complexity bounds, focussing on the class NC of problems within P solvable in
polylogarithmic parallel time. For finite Q-weighted automata, we give a
randomised NC procedure that either outputs that two automata are equivalent or
returns a word on which they differ. We also give an NC procedure for deciding
whether a given automaton is minimal, as well as a randomised NC procedure that
minimises an automaton. We consider probabilistic automata with rewards,
similar to Markov Decision Processes. For these automata we consider two
notions of equivalence: expectation equivalence and distribution equivalence.
The former requires that two automata have the same expected reward on each
input word, while the latter requires that each input word induce the same
distribution on rewards in each automaton. For both notions we give algorithms
for deciding equivalence by reduction to equivalence of Q-weighted automata.
Finally we show that the equivalence problem for Q-weighted visibly pushdown
automata is logspace equivalent to the polynomial identity testing problem."
"A recent result of Haase et al. has shown that reachability in two-clock
timed automata is log-space equivalent to reachability in bounded one-counter
automata. We show that reachability in bounded one-counter automata is
PSPACE-complete."
"The well known Hopcroft's algorithm to minimize deterministic complete
automata runs in $O(kn\log n)$-time, where $k$ is the size of the alphabet and
$n$ the number of states. The main part of this algorithm corresponds to the
computation of a coarsest bisimulation over a finite Deterministic Labelled
Transition System (DLTS). By applying techniques we have developed in the case
of simulations, we design a new algorithm which computes the coarsest
bisimulation over a finite DLTS in $O(m\log n)$-time and $O(k+m+n)$-space, with
$m$ the number of transitions. The underlying DLTS does not need to be complete
and thus: $m\leq kn$. This new algorithm is much simpler than the two others
found in the literature."
"We consider the computational power of silent transitions in one-way automata
with storage. Specifically, we ask which storage mechanisms admit a
transformation of a given automaton into one that accepts the same language and
reads at least one input symbol in each step.
  We study this question using the model of valence automata. Here, a finite
automaton is equipped with a storage mechanism that is given by a monoid.
  This work presents generalizations of known results on silent transitions.
For two classes of monoids, it provides characterizations of those monoids that
allow the removal of \lambda-transitions. Both classes are defined by graph
products of copies of the bicyclic monoid and the group of integers. The first
class contains pushdown storages as well as the blind counters while the second
class contains the blind and the partially blind counters."
"We relate two measures of complexity of regular languages. The first is
syntactic complexity, that is, the cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of
the language. That semigroup is isomorphic to the semigroup of transformations
of states induced by non-empty words in the minimal deterministic finite
automaton accepting the language. If the language has n left quotients (its
minimal automaton has n states), then its syntactic complexity is at most n^n
and this bound is tight. The second measure consists of the quotient (state)
complexities of the atoms of the language, where atoms are non-empty
intersections of complemented and uncomplemented quotients. A regular language
has at most 2^n atoms and this bound is tight. The maximal quotient complexity
of any atom with r complemented quotients is 2^n-1, if r=0 or r=n, and
1+\sum_{k=1}^{r} \sum_{h=k+1}^{k+n-r} \binom{h}{n} \binom{k}{h}, otherwise. We
prove that if a language has maximal syntactic complexity, then it has 2^n
atoms and each atom has maximal quotient complexity, but the converse is false."
"To model Web services handling data from an infinite domain, or with multiple
sessions, we introduce fresh-variable automata, a simple extension of
finite-state automata in which some transitions are labeled with variables that
can be refreshed in some specified states. We prove several closure properties
for this class of automata and study their decision problems. We then introduce
a notion of simulation that enables us to reduce the Web service composition
problem to the construction of a simulation of a target service by the
asynchronous product of existing services, and prove that this construction is
computable."
"We present several infinite series of synchronizing automata for which the
minimum length of reset words is close to the square of the number of states.
All these automata are tightly related to primitive digraphs with large
exponent."
"When can two regular word languages K and L be separated by a simple
language? We investigate this question and consider separation by piecewise-
and suffix-testable languages and variants thereof. We give characterizations
of when two languages can be separated and present an overview of when these
problems can be decided in polynomial time if K and L are given by
nondeterministic automata."
"Separation is a classical problem in mathematics and computer science. It
asks whether, given two sets belonging to some class, it is possible to
separate them by another set of a smaller class. We present and discuss the
separation problem for regular languages. We then give a direct polynomial time
algorithm to check whether two given regular languages are separable by a
piecewise testable language, that is, whether a $B{\Sigma}1(<)$ sentence can
witness that the languages are indeed disjoint. The proof is a reformulation
and a refinement of an algebraic argument already given by Almeida and the
second author."
"We consider the so-called measure once finite quantum automata model
introduced by Moore and Crutchfield in 2000. We show that given a language
recognized by such a device and a linear context-free language, it is
recursively decidable whether or not they have a nonempty intersection. This
extends a result of Blondel et al. which can be interpreted as solving the
problem with the free monoid in place of the family of linear context-free
languages."
"The decidability of determining equivalence of deterministic multitape
automata (or transducers) was a longstanding open problem until it was resolved
by Harju and Karhum\""{a}ki in the early 1990s. Their proof of decidability
yields a co_NP upper bound, but apparently not much more is known about the
complexity of the problem. In this paper we give an alternative proof of
decidability, which follows the basic strategy of Harju and Karhumaki but
replaces their use of group theory with results on matrix algebras. From our
proof we obtain a simple randomised algorithm for deciding language equivalence
of deterministic multitape automata and, more generally, multiplicity
equivalence of nondeterministic multitape automata. The algorithm involves only
matrix exponentiation and runs in polynomial time for each fixed number of
tapes. If the two input automata are inequivalent then the algorithm outputs a
word on which they differ."
"The tight upper bound on the state complexity of the reverse of R-trivial and
J-trivial regular languages of the state complexity n is 2^{n-1}. The witness
is ternary for R-trivial regular languages and (n-1)-ary for J-trivial regular
languages. In this paper, we prove that the bound can be met neither by a
binary R-trivial regular language nor by a J-trivial regular language over an
(n-2)-element alphabet. We provide a characterization of tight bounds for
R-trivial regular languages depending on the state complexity of the language
and the size of its alphabet. We show the tight bound for J-trivial regular
languages over an (n-2)-element alphabet and a few tight bounds for binary
J-trivial regular languages. The case of J-trivial regular languages over an
(n-k)-element alphabet, for 2 <= k <= n-3, is open."
"Bruyere and Carton lifted the notion of finite automata reading infinite
words to finite automata reading words with shape an arbitrary linear order L.
Automata on finite words can be used to represent infinite structures, the
so-called word-automatic structures. Analogously, for a linear order L there is
the class of L-automatic structures. In this paper we prove the following
limitations on the class of L-automatic structures for a fixed L of finite
condensation rank 1+\alpha. Firstly, no scattered linear order with finite
condensation rank above \omega^(\alpha+1) is L-\alpha-automatic. In particular,
every L-automatic ordinal is below \omega^\omega^(\alpha+1). Secondly, we
provide bounds on the (ordinal) height of well-founded order trees that are
L-automatic. If \alpha is finite or L is an ordinal, the height of such a tree
is bounded by \omega^{\alpha+1}. Finally, we separate the class of
tree-automatic structures from that of L-automatic structures for any ordinal
L: the countable atomless boolean algebra is known to be tree-automatic, but we
show that it is not L-automatic."
"Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) have
several similarities and a few differences in both their syntax and semantics,
but they are usually presented through formalisms that hinder a proper
comparison. In this paper we present a new formalism for CFGs that highlights
the similarities and differences between them. The new formalism borrows from
PEGs the use of parsing expressions and the recognition-based semantics. We
show how one way of removing non-determinism from this formalism yields a
formalism with the semantics of PEGs. We also prove, based on these new
formalisms, how LL(1) grammars define the same language whether interpreted as
CFGs or as PEGs, and also show how strong-LL(k), right-linear, and LL-regular
grammars have simple language-preserving translations from CFGs to PEGs."
"We study ideal languages generated by a single word. We provide an algorithm
to construct a strongly connected synchronizing automaton for which such a
language serves as the language of synchronizing words. Also we present a
compact formula to calculate the syntactic complexity of this language."
"One-counter nets (OCN) are Petri nets with exactly one unbounded place. They
are equivalent to a subclass of one-counter automata with only a weak test for
zero. We show that weak simulation preorder is decidable for OCN and that weak
simulation approximants do not converge at level omega, but only at omega^2. In
contrast, other semantic relations like weak bisimulation are undecidable for
OCN, and so are weak (and strong) trace inclusion."
"We investigate some basic questions about the interaction of regular and
rational relations on words. The primary motivation comes from the study of
logics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous
applications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular
languages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational
relations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended
graph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of
rational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,
to the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a
regular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).
  We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the
intersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for
subword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with
non-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its
generalizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph
logics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to
provide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that
has non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for
logics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations
on paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classifies them into
either efficiently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of
rational relations for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic
restrictions."
"We define guarded variable automata (GVAs), a simple extension of finite
automata over infinite alphabets. In this model the transitions are labelled by
letters or variables ranging over an infinite alphabet and guarded by
conjunction of equalities and disequalities. GVAs are well-suited for modeling
component-based applications such as web services. They are closed under
intersection, union, concatenation and Kleene operator, and their nonemptiness
problem is PSPACE-complete. We show that the simulation preorder of GVAs is
decidable. Our proof relies on the characterization of the simulation by means
of games and strategies. This result can be applied to service composition
synthesis."
"We give a Kleene-type operational characterization of Muller context-free
languages (MCFLs) of well-ordered and scattered words."
"Separation is a classical problem asking whether, given two sets belonging to
some class, it is possible to separate them by a set from a smaller class. We
discuss the separation problem for regular languages. We give a Ptime algorithm
to check whether two given regular languages are separable by a piecewise
testable language, that is, whether a $B{\Sigma}1(<)$ sentence can witness that
the languages are disjoint. The proof refines an algebraic argument from
Almeida and the third author. When separation is possible, we also express a
separator by saturating one of the original languages by a suitable congruence.
Following the same line, we show that one can as well decide whether two
regular languages can be separated by an unambiguous language, albeit with a
higher complexity."
"Additive Cost Register Automata (ACRA) map strings to integers using a finite
set of registers that are updated using assignments of the form ""x := y + c"" at
every step. The corresponding class of additive regular functions has multiple
equivalent characterizations, appealing closure properties, and a decidable
equivalence problem. In this paper, we solve two decision problems for this
model. First, we define the register complexity of an additive regular function
to be the minimum number of registers that an ACRA needs to compute it. We
characterize the register complexity by a necessary and sufficient condition
regarding the largest subset of registers whose values can be made far apart
from one another. We then use this condition to design a PSPACE algorithm to
compute the register complexity of a given ACRA, and establish a matching lower
bound. Our results also lead to a machine-independent characterization of the
register complexity of additive regular functions. Second, we consider
two-player games over ACRAs, where the objective of one of the players is to
reach a target set while minimizing the cost. We show the corresponding
decision problem to be EXPTIME-complete when costs are non-negative integers,
but undecidable when costs are integers."
"We study representations of ideal languages by means of strongly connected
synchronizing automata. For every finitely generated ideal language L we
construct such an automaton with at most 2^n states, where n is the maximal
length of words in L. Our constructions are based on the De Bruijn graph."
"Budach's Mouse-in-an-Octant Problem (attributed to Lothar Budach in a 1980
article by van Emde Boas and Karpinski) concerns the behaviour of a very simple
finite-state machine (""the mouse"") moving on the integer two-dimensional grid.
Its decidability is apparently still open. This note sketches a proof that an
extended version of the problem (a super-mouse) is undecidable."
"State minimization is a fundamental problem in automata theory. The problem
is also of great importance in the study of fuzzy automata. However, most work
in the literature considered only state reduction of fuzzy automata, whereas
the state minimization problem is almost untouched for fuzzy automata. Thus in
this paper we focus on the latter problem. Formally, the decision version of
the minimization problem of fuzzy automata is as follows: \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a fuzzy automaton $\mathcal{A}$ and a natural number $k$, that
is, a pair $\langle \mathcal{A}, k\rangle$, is there a $k$-state fuzzy
automaton equivalent to $\mathcal{A}$? \end{itemize} We prove for the first
time that the above problem is decidable for fuzzy automata over totally
ordered lattices. To this end, we first give the concept of systems of fuzzy
polynomial equations and then present a procedure to solve these systems.
Afterwards, we apply the solvability of a system of fuzzy polynomial equations
to the minimization problem mentioned above, obtaining the decidability.
Finally, we point out that the above problem is at least as hard as
PSAPCE-complete."
"In a recent thread of papers, we have introduced FQL, a precise specification
language for test coverage, and developed the test case generation engine
FShell for ANSI C. In essence, an FQL test specification amounts to a set of
regular languages, each of which has to be matched by at least one test
execution. To describe such sets of regular languages, the FQL semantics uses
an automata-theoretic concept known as rational sets of regular languages
(RSRLs). RSRLs are automata whose alphabet consists of regular expressions.
Thus, the language accepted by the automaton is a set of regular expressions.
  In this paper, we study RSRLs from a theoretic point of view. More
specifically, we analyze RSRL closure properties under common set theoretic
operations, and the complexity of membership checking, i.e., whether a regular
language is an element of a RSRL. For all questions we investigate both the
general case and the case of finite sets of regular languages. Although a few
properties are left as open problems, the paper provides a systematic semantic
foundation for the test specification language FQL."
"This work is a contribution to the study of set of the representations of
integers in a rational base number system. This prefix-closed subset of the
free monoid is naturally represented as a highly non regular tree whose nodes
are the integers and whose subtrees are all distinct. With every node of that
tree is then associated a minimal infinite word. The main result is that a
sequential transducer which computes for all n the minimal word associated with
n+1 from the one associated with n, has essentially the same underlying graph
as the tree itself. These infinite words are then interpreted as
representations of real numbers; the difference between the numbers represented
by these two consecutive minimal words is the called the span of a node of the
tree. The preceding construction allows to characterise the topological closure
of the set of spans."
"For any context-free grammar, we build a transition diagram, that is, a
finite directed graph with labeled arcs, which describes the work of the
grammar. This approach is new, and it is different from previously known graph
models. We define the concept of proper walk in this transition diagram and we
prove that a word belongs to a given context-free language if and only if this
word can be obtained with the help of a proper walk."
"Higher-order counter automata (\HOCS) can be either seen as a restriction of
higher-order pushdown automata (\HOPS) to a unary stack alphabet, or as an
extension of counter automata to higher levels. We distinguish two principal
kinds of \HOCS: those that can test whether the topmost counter value is zero
and those which cannot.
  We show that control-state reachability for level $k$ \HOCS with $0$-test is
complete for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential space; leaving out the $0$-test
leads to completeness for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential time. Restricting
\HOCS (without $0$-test) to level $2$, we prove that global (forward or
backward) reachability analysis is $\PTIME$-complete. This enhances the known
result for pushdown systems which are subsumed by level $2$ \HOCS without
$0$-test.
  We transfer our results to the formal language setting. Assuming that $\PTIME
\subsetneq \PSPACE \subsetneq \mathbf{EXPTIME}$, we apply proof ideas of
Engelfriet and conclude that the hierarchies of languages of \HOPS and of \HOCS
form strictly interleaving hierarchies. Interestingly, Engelfriet's
constructions also allow to conclude immediately that the hierarchy of
collapsible pushdown languages is strict level-by-level due to the existing
complexity results for reachability on collapsible pushdown graphs. This
answers an open question independently asked by Parys and by Kobayashi."
"Pushdown automata may contain transitions that are never used in any
accepting run of the automaton. We present an algorithm for detecting such
useless transitions. A finite automaton that captures the possible stack
content during runs of the pushdown automaton, is first constructed in a
forward procedure to determine which transitions are reachable, and then
employed in a backward procedure to determine which of these transitions can
lead to a final stat"
"Eilenberg's holonomy decomposition is useful to ascertain the structural
properties of automata. Using this method, Egri-Nagy and Nehaniv characterized
the absence of certain types of cycles in automata. In the direction of
studying the structure of automata with cycles, this work focuses on a special
class of semi-flower automata and establish the holonomy decompositions of
certain circular semi-flower automata."
"We investigate the syntactic complexity of certain types of finitely
generated submonoids of a free monoid. In fact, we consider those submonoids
which are accepted by circular semi-flower automata (CSFA). Here, we show that
the syntactic complexity of CSFA with at most one `branch point going in' (bpi)
is linear. Further, we prove that the syntactic complexity of $n$-state CSFA
with two bpis over a binary alphabet is $2n(n+1)$."
"Several algorithms have been designed to convert a regular expression into an
equivalent finite automaton. One of the most popular constructions, due to
Glushkov and to McNaughton and Yamada, is based on the computation of the Null,
First, Last and Follow sets (called Glushkov functions) associated with a
linearized version of the expression. Recently Mignot considered a family of
extended expressions called Extended to multi-tilde-bar Regular Expressions
(EmtbREs) and he showed that, under some restrictions, Glushkov functions can
be defined for an EmtbRE. In this paper we present an algorithm which
efficiently computes the Glushkov functions of an unrestricted EmtbRE. Our
approach is based on a recursive definition of the language associated with an
EmtbRE which enlightens the fact that the worst case time complexity of the
conversion of an EmtbRE into an automaton is related to the worst case time
complexity of the computation of the Null function. Finally we show how to
extend the ZPC-structure to EmtbREs, which allows us to apply to this family of
extended expressions the efficient constructions based on this structure (in
particular the construction of the c-continuation automaton, the position
automaton, the follow automaton and the equation automaton)."
"The present work determines the exact nature of {\em linear time computable}
notions which characterise automatic functions (those whose graphs are
recognised by a finite automaton). The paper also determines which type of
linear time notions permit full learnability for learning in the limit of
automatic classes (families of languages which are uniformly recognised by a
finite automaton). In particular it is shown that a function is automatic iff
there is a one-tape Turing machine with a left end which computes the function
in linear time where the input before the computation and the output after the
computation both start at the left end. It is known that learners realised as
automatic update functions are restrictive for learning. In the present work it
is shown that one can overcome the problem by providing work tapes additional
to a resource-bounded base tape while keeping the update-time to be linear in
the length of the largest datum seen so far. In this model, one additional such
work tape provides additional learning power over the automatic learner model
and two additional work tapes give full learning power. Furthermore, one can
also consider additional queues or additional stacks in place of additional
work tapes and for these devices, one queue or two stacks are sufficient for
full learning power while one stack is insufficient."
"A separator for two languages is a third language containing the first one
and disjoint from the second one. We investigate the following decision
problem: given two regular input languages, decide whether there exists a
locally testable (resp. a locally threshold testable) separator. In both cases,
we design a decision procedure based on the occurrence of special patterns in
automata accepting the input languages. We prove that the problem is
computationally harder than deciding membership. The correctness proof of the
algorithm yields a stronger result, namely a description of a possible
separator. Finally, we discuss the same problem for context-free input
languages."
"An abstract numeration system (ANS) is a numeration system that provides a
one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and a regular language.
In this paper, we define an ANS-based compression as an extension of this
correspondence. In addition, we show the following results: 1) an average
compression ratio is computable from a language, 2) an ANS-based compression
runs in sublinear time with respect to the length of the input string, and 3)
an ANS-based compression can be extended to block-based compression using a
factorial language."
"The atoms of a regular language are non-empty intersections of complemented
and uncomplemented quotients of the language. Tight upper bounds on the number
of atoms of a language and on the quotient complexities of atoms are known. We
introduce a new class of regular languages, called the maximally atomic
languages, consisting of all languages meeting these bounds. We prove the
following result: If L is a regular language of quotient complexity n and G is
the subgroup of permutations in the transition semigroup T of the minimal DFA
of L, then L is maximally atomic if and only if G is transitive on k-subsets of
1,...,n for 0 <= k <= n and T contains a transformation of rank n-1."
"This paper includes notes to accompany a reading of Thue's 1914 paper
""Probleme uber Veranderungen von Zeichenreihen nach gegebenen Reglen"", along
with a translation of that paper. Thue's 1914 paper is mainly famous for
proving an early example of an undecidable problem, cited prominently by Post.
However, Post's paper principally makes use of the definition of Thue systems,
described on the first two pages of Thue's paper, and does not depend on the
more specific results in the remainder of Thue's paper. A closer study of the
remaining parts of that paper highlight a number of important themes in the
history of computing: the transition from algebra to formal language theory,
the analysis of the ""computational power"" (in a pre-1936 sense) of rules, and
the development of algorithms to generate rule-sets."
"Back in the 80s, the class of mildly context-sensitive formalisms was
introduced so as to capture the syntax of natural languages. While the
languages generated by such formalisms are constrained by the constant-growth
property, the most well-known and used mildly-context sensitive formalisms,
like tree-adjoining grammars or multiple context-free grammars, generate
languages which verify the stronger property of being semilinear. In (Bourreau
et al., 2012), the operation of IO-ubstitution was created so as to exhibit
mildly context-sensitive classes of languages which are not semilinear,
although they verify the constant-growth property. In the present article, we
extend the notion of semilinearity, and characterise the Parikh image of the
IO-MCFLs (i.e. languages which belong to the closure of MCFLs under
IO-subsitution) as universally-linear. Based on this result and on the work of
Fischer on macro-grammars, we then show IO-MCFLs are not closed under inverse
homomorphism, which proves that the family of IO-MCFLs is not an abstract
family of languages."
"Top-down tree transducers are a convenient formalism for describing tree
transformations. They can be equipped with regular look-ahead, which allows
them to inspect a subtree before processing it. In certain cases, such a
look-ahead can be avoided and the transformation can be realized by a
transducer without look-ahead. Removing the look-ahead from a transducer, if
possible, is technically highly challenging. For a restricted class of
transducers with look-ahead, namely those that are total, deterministic,
ultralinear, and bounded erasing, we present an algorithm that, for a given
transducer from that class, (1) decides whether it is equivalent to a total
deterministic transducer without look-ahead, and (2) constructs such a
transducer if the answer is positive. For the whole class of total
deterministic transducers with look-ahead we present a similar algorithm, which
assumes that a so-called difference bound is known for the given transducer.
The designer of a transducer can usually also determine a difference bound for
it."
"We study some basic properties of sofic-Dyck shifts and finite-type-Dyck
shifts. We prove that the class of sofic-Dyck shifts is stable under proper
conjugacies. We prove a Decomposition Theorem of a proper conjugacy between
edge-Dyck shifts into a sequence of Dyck splittings and amalgamations."
"A right ideal is a language L over an alphabet A that satisfies L = LA*. We
show that there exists a stream (sequence) (R_n : n \ge 3) of regular right
ideal languages, where R_n has n left quotients and is most complex under the
following measures of complexity: the state complexities of the left quotients,
the number of atoms (intersections of complemented and uncomplemented left
quotients), the state complexities of the atoms, the size of the syntactic
semigroup, the state complexities of the operations of reversal, star, and
product, and the state complexities of all binary boolean operations. In that
sense, this stream of right ideals is a universal witness."
"Algorithms for (nondeterministic) finite-state tree automata (FTAs) are often
tested on random FTAs, in which all internal transitions are equiprobable. The
run-time results obtained in this manner are usually overly optimistic as most
such generated random FTAs are trivial in the sense that the number of states
of an equivalent minimal deterministic FTA is extremely small. It is
demonstrated that nontrivial random FTAs are obtained only for a narrow band of
transition probabilities. Moreover, an analytic analysis yields a formula to
approximate the transition probability that yields the most complex random
FTAs, which should be used in experiments."
"Visibly pushdown transducers (VPTs) are visibly pushdown automata extended
with outputs. They have been introduced to model transformations of nested
words, i.e. words with a call/return structure. As trees and more generally
hedges can be linearized into (well) nested words, VPTs are a natural formalism
to express tree transformations evaluated in streaming. This paper aims at
characterizing precisely the expressive power of VPTs with respect to other
tree transducer models."
"In this paper we adapt the well-known Brzozowski determinization method to
fuzzy automata. This method gives better results than all previously known
methods for determinization of fuzzy automata developed by B\v{e}lohl\'avek
[Inform Sciences 143 (2002) 205--209], Li and Pedrycz [Fuzzy Set Syst 156
(2005) 68--92], Ignjatovi\'c et al. [Inform Sciences 178 (2008) 164--180], and
Jan\v{c}i\'c et al. [Inform Sciences 181 (2011) 1358--1368]. Namely, as in the
case of ordinary nondeterministic automata, Brzozowski type determinization of
a fuzzy automaton results in a minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton
equivalent to the starting fuzzy automaton, and we show that there are cases
when all previous methods result in infinite automata, while Brzozowski type
determinization results in a finite one. The paper deals with fuzzy automata
over complete residuated lattices, but identical results can also be obtained
in a more general context, for fuzzy automata over lattice-ordered monoids, and
even for weighted automata over commutative semirings."
"This paper presents a restricted form of linear indexed grammars, called even
linear indexed grammars, which yield the even linear indexed languages. These
languages properly contain the context-free languages and are contained in the
set of linear indexed languages. We show that several patterns found in natural
languages are also generated by these grammars, including crossing
dependencies, copying, and multiple agreements. We discuss the learning problem
for even linear indexed languages and show that it is reducible to that of the
context-free languages. The closure properties for this class of languages are
also presented."
"Let $\Sigma = X\cup X^{-1} = \{ x_1 ,x_2 ,..., x_m ,x_1^{-1} ,x_2^{-1} ,...,
x_m^{-1} \}$ and let $G$ be a group with set of generators $\Sigma$. Let
$\mathfrak{L} (G) =\left\{ \left. \omega \in \Sigma^* \; \right\vert \;\omega
\equiv e \; (\textrm{mod} \; G) \right\} \subseteq \Sigma^*$ be the group
language representing $G$, where $\Sigma^*$ is a free monoid over $\Sigma$ and
$e$ is the identity in $G$. The problem of determining whether a context-free
language is subset of a group language is discussed. Polynomial algorithms are
presented for testing whether a regular language, or a linear language is
included in a group language. A few finite sets are built, such that each of
them is included in the group language $\mathfrak{L} (G)$ if and only if the
respective context-free language is included in $\mathfrak{L} (G)$."
"We define a model of advised computation by finite automata where the advice
is provided on a separate tape. We consider several variants of the model where
the advice is deterministic or randomized, the input tape head is allowed
real-time, one-way, or two-way access, and the automaton is classical or
quantum. We prove several separation results among these variants, demonstrate
an infinite hierarchy of language classes recognized by automata with
increasing advice lengths, and establish the relationships between this and the
previously studied ways of providing advice to finite automata."
"Turing machines and G\""odel numbers are important pillars of the theory of
computation. Thus, any computational architecture needs to show how it could
relate to Turing machines and how stable implementations of Turing computation
are possible. In this chapter, we implement universal Turing computation in a
neural field environment. To this end, we employ the canonical symbologram
representation of a Turing machine obtained from a G\""odel encoding of its
symbolic repertoire and generalized shifts. The resulting nonlinear dynamical
automaton (NDA) is a piecewise affine-linear map acting on the unit square that
is partitioned into rectangular domains. Instead of looking at point dynamics
in phase space, we then consider functional dynamics of probability
distributions functions (p.d.f.s) over phase space. This is generally described
by a Frobenius-Perron integral transformation that can be regarded as a neural
field equation over the unit square as feature space of a dynamic field theory
(DFT). Solving the Frobenius-Perron equation yields that uniform p.d.f.s with
rectangular support are mapped onto uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support,
again. We call the resulting representation \emph{dynamic field automaton}."
"We focus on (partial) functions that map input strings to a monoid such as
the set of integers with addition and the set of output strings with
concatenation. The notion of regularity for such functions has been defined
using two-way finite-state transducers, (one-way) cost register automata, and
MSO-definable graph transformations. In this paper, we give an algebraic and
machine-independent characterization of this class analogous to the definition
of regular languages by regular expressions. When the monoid is commutative, we
prove that every regular function can be constructed from constant functions
using the combinators of choice, split sum, and iterated sum, that are analogs
of union, concatenation, and Kleene-*, respectively, but enforce unique (or
unambiguous) parsing. Our main result is for the general case of
non-commutative monoids, which is of particular interest for capturing regular
string-to-string transformations for document processing. We prove that the
following additional combinators suffice for constructing all regular
functions: (1) the left-additive versions of split sum and iterated sum, which
allow transformations such as string reversal; (2) sum of functions, which
allows transformations such as copying of strings; and (3) function
composition, or alternatively, a new concept of chained sum, which allows
output values from adjacent blocks to mix."
"Mazurkiewicz traces describe concurrent behaviors of distributed systems.
Trace-closed word languages, which are ""linearizations"" of trace languages,
constitute a weaker notion of concurrency but still give us tools to
investigate the latter. In this vein, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we
develop definitions that allow classification of $\omega$-regular trace
languages in terms of the corresponding trace-closed $\omega$-regular word
languages, capturing E-recognizable (reachability) and (deterministically)
B\""uchi recognizable languages. Secondly, we demonstrate the first
automata-theoretic result that shows the equivalence of $\omega$-regular
trace-closed word languages and Boolean combinations of deterministically
$I$-diamond B\""uchi recognizable trace-closed languages."
"We study the problem of revising specifications with preferences for automata
based control synthesis problems. In this class of revision problems, the user
provides a numerical ranking of the desirability of the subgoals in their
specifications. When the specification cannot be satisfied on the system, then
our algorithms automatically revise the specification so that the least
desirable user goals are removed from the specification. We propose two
different versions of the revision problem with preferences. In the first
version, the algorithm returns an exact solution while in the second version
the algorithm is an approximation algorithm with non-constant approximation
ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms and we
experimentally study the approximation ratio of the approximation algorithm on
random problem instances."
"Shallit and Wang studied deterministic automatic complexity of words. They
showed that the automatic Hausdorff dimension $I(\mathbf t)$ of the infinite
Thue word satisfies $1/3\le I(\mathbf t)\le 2/3$. We improve that result by
showing that $I(\mathbf t)\ge 1/2$. For nondeterministic automatic complexity
we show $I(\mathbf t)=1/2$. We prove that such complexity $A_N$ of a word $x$
of length $n$ satisfies $A_N(x)\le b(n):=\lfloor n/2\rfloor + 1$. This enables
us to define the complexity deficiency $D(x)=b(n)-A_N(x)$. If $x$ is
square-free then $D(x)=0$. If $x$ almost square-free in the sense of Fraenkel
and Simpson, or if $x$ is a strongly cube-free binary word such as the infinite
Thue word, then $D(x)\le 1$. On the other hand, there is no constant upper
bound on $D$ for strongly cube-free words in a ternary alphabet, nor for
cube-free words in a binary alphabet. The decision problem whether $D(x)\ge d$
for given $x$, $d$ belongs to $NP\cap E$."
"In this paper we study the word problem of groups corresponding to
tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. In particular using the Fibonacci
technology developed by the second author we show that groups corresponding to
the pentagrid or the heptagrid are not automatic."
"In this paper we combine determinization and state reduction methods into
two-in-one algorithms that simultaneously perform determinization and state
reduction. These algorithms perform better than all previous determinization
algorithms for fuzzy finite automata, developed by Belohlavek [Inform Sciences
143 (2002) 205-209], Li and Pedrycz [Fuzzy Set Syst 156 (2005) 68-92],
Ignjatovi\'c et al. [Inform Sciences 178 (2008) 164-180], and Jan\v{c}i\'c et
al. [Inform Sciences 181 (2011) 1358-1368], in the sense that they produce
smaller automata, while require the same computation time. The only exception
is the Brzozowski type determinization algorithm developed recently by
Jan\v{c}i\'c and \'Ciri\'c [Fuzzy Set Syst (2014), to appear], which produces a
minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton, but the algorithms created here
can also be used within the Brzozowski type algorithm and improve its
performances."
"Timed pushdown automata are pushdown automata extended with a finite set of
real-valued clocks. Additionaly, each symbol in the stack is equipped with a
value representing its age. The enabledness of a transition may depend on the
values of the clocks and the age of the topmost symbol. Therefore, dense-timed
pushdown automata subsume both pushdown automata and timed automata. We have
previously shown that the reachability problem for this model is decidable. In
this paper, we study the zenoness problem and show that it is EXPTIME-complete."
"We give an upper bound of $n((n-1)!-(n-3)!)$ for the possible largest size of
a subsemigroup of the full transformational semigroup over $n$ elements
consisting only of nonpermutational transformations. As an application we gain
the same upper bound for the syntactic complexity of (generalized) definite
languages as well."
"We solve two open problems concerning syntactic complexity: We prove that the
cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a left ideal or a suffix-closed
language with $n$ left quotients (that is, with state complexity $n$) is at
most $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and that of a two-sided ideal or a factor-closed language
is at most $n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$. Since these bounds are known to be
reachable, this settles the problems."
"We present a strongly exponential lower bound that applies both to the subset
synchronization threshold for binary deterministic automata and to the careful
synchronization threshold for binary partial automata. In the later form, the
result finishes the research initiated by Martyugin (2013). Moreover, we show
that both the thresholds remain strongly exponential even if restricted to
strongly connected binary automata. In addition, we apply our methods to
computational complexity. Existence of a subset reset word is known to be
PSPACE-complete; we show that this holds even under the restriction to strongly
connected binary automata. The results apply also to the corresponding
thresholds in two more general settings: D1- and D3-directable nondeterministic
automata and composition sequences over finite domains."
"We present several series of synchronizing automata with multiple parameters,
generalizing previously known results. Let p and q be two arbitrary co-prime
positive integers, q > p. We describe reset thresholds of the colorings of
primitive digraphs with exactly one cycle of length p and one cycle of length
q. Also, we study reset thresholds of the colorings of primitive digraphs with
exactly one cycle of length q and two cycles of length p."
"First, we close the multivariate analysis of a canonical problem concerning
short reset words (SYN), as it was started by Fernau et al. (2013). Namely, we
prove that the problem, parameterized by the number of states, does not admit a
polynomial kernel unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Second, we
consider a related canonical problem concerning synchronizing road colorings
(SRCP). Here we give a similar complete multivariate analysis. Namely, we show
that the problem, parameterized by the number of states, admits a polynomial
kernel and we close the previous research of restrictions to particular values
of both the alphabet size and the maximum word length."
"We present an algorithm which modifies a deterministic pushdown automaton
(DPDA) such that (i) the marked language is preserved, (ii) lifelocks are
removed, (iii) deadlocks are removed, (iv) all states and edges are accessible,
and (v) operational blockfreeness is established (i.e., coaccessibility in the
sense that every initial derivation can be continued to a marking
configuration). This problem can be trivially solved for deterministic finite
automata (DFA) but is not solvable for standard petri net classes. The
algorithm is required for an operational extension of the supervisory control
problem (SCP) to the situation where the specification in modeled by a DPDA."
"This work builds on the notion of breadth-first signature of infinite trees
and (prefix-closed) languages introduced by the authors in a previous work. We
focus here on periodic signatures, a case coming from the study of rational
base numeration systems; the language of integer representations in
base~$\frac{p}{q}$ has a purely periodic signature whose period is derived from
the Christoffel word of slope~$\frac{p}{q}$. Conversely, we characterise
languages whose signature are purely periodic as representations of integers in
such number systems with non-canonical alphabets of digits."
"We introduce two generalizations of synchronizability to automata with
transitions weighted in an arbitrary semiring K=(K,+,*,0,1). (or equivalently,
to finite sets of matrices in K^nxn.) Let us call a matrix A
location-synchronizing if there exists a column in A consisting of nonzero
entries such that all the other columns of A are filled by zeros. If
additionally all the entries of this designated column are the same, we call A
synchronizing. Note that these notions coincide for stochastic matrices and
also in the Boolean semiring. A set M of matrices in K^nxn is called
(location-)synchronizing if M generates a matrix subsemigroup containing a
(location-)synchronizing matrix. The K-(location-)synchronizability problem is
the following: given a finite set M of nxn matrices with entries in K, is it
(location-)synchronizing?
  Both problems are PSPACE-hard for any nontrivial semiring. We give sufficient
conditions for the semiring K when the problems are PSPACE-complete and show
several undecidability results as well, e.g. synchronizability is undecidable
if 1 has infinite order in (K,+,0) or when the free semigroup on two generators
can be embedded into (K,*,1)."
"This work considers a natural generalization of primitivity with respect to a
language. Given a language $L$, a nonempty word $w$ is said to be $L$-primitive
if $w$ is not a proper power of any word in $L$. After ascertaining the number
of primitive words in submonoids of a free monoid, the work proceeds to count
$L$-primitive words in submonoids of a free monoid. The work also studies the
distribution of $L$-primitive words in certain subsets of free monoids."
"In this paper we propose two behavioral distances that support approximate
reasoning on Stochastic Markov Models (SMMs), that are continuous-time
stochastic transition systems where the residence time on each state is
described by a generic probability measure on the positive real line. In
particular, we study the problem of measuring the behavioral dissimilarity of
two SMMs against linear real-time specifications expressed as Metric Temporal
Logic (MTL) formulas or Deterministic Timed-Automata (DTA). The most natural
choice for such a distance is the one that measures the maximal difference that
can be observed comparing two SMMs with respect to their probability of
satisfying an arbitrary specification. We show that computing this metric is
NP-hard. In addition, we show that any algorithm that approximates the distance
within a certain absolute error, depending on the size of the SMMs, is NP-hard.
Nevertheless, we introduce an alternative distance, based on the Kantorovich
metric, that is an over-approximation of the former and we show that, under
mild assumptions on the residence time distributions, it can be computed in
polynomial time."
"In 2007 Kambites presented an algebraic interpretation of
Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem for context-free languages. We give an
interpretation of the corresponding theorem for the class of displacement
context-free languages which are equivalent to well-nested multiple
context-free languages. We also obtain a characterization of k-displacement
context-free languages in terms of monoid automata and show how such automata
can be simulated on two stacks. We introduce the simultaneous two-stack
automata and compare different variants of its definition. All the definitions
considered are shown to be equivalent basing on the geometric interpretation of
memory operations of these automata."
"The pumping lemma and Ogden lemma offer a powerful method to prove that a
particular language is not context-free. In 2008 Kanazawa proved an analogue of
pumping lemma for well-nested multiple-context free languages. However, the
statement of lemma is too weak for practical usage. We prove a stronger variant
of pumping lemma and an analogue of Ogden lemma for this language family. We
also use these statements to prove that some natural context-sensitive
languages cannot be generated by tree-adjoining grammars."
"There exist several methods of computing an automaton recognizing the
language denoted by a given regular expression: In the case of words, the
position automaton P due to Glushkov, the c-continuation automaton C due to
Champarnaud and Ziadi, the follow automaton F due to Ilie and Yu and the
equation automaton E due to Antimirov. It has been shown that P and C are
isomorphic and that E (resp. F) is a quotient of C (resp. of P). In this paper,
we define from a given regular tree expression the k-position tree automaton P
and the follow tree automaton F . Using the definition of the equation tree
automaton E of Kuske and Meinecke and our previously defined k-C-continuation
tree automaton C, we show that the previous morphic relations are still valid
on tree expressions."
"We present a disambiguation algorithm for weighted automata. The algorithm
admits two main stages: a pre-disambiguation stage followed by a transition
removal stage. We give a detailed description of the algorithm and the proof of
its correctness. The algorithm is not applicable to all weighted automata but
we prove sufficient conditions for its applicability in the case of the
tropical semiring by introducing the *weak twins property*. In particular, the
algorithm can be used with all acyclic weighted automata, relevant to
applications. While disambiguation can sometimes be achieved using
determinization, our disambiguation algorithm in some cases can return a result
that is exponentially smaller than any equivalent deterministic automaton. We
also present some empirical evidence of the space benefits of disambiguation
over determinization in speech recognition and machine translation
applications."
"Automata play important roles in wide area of computing and the growth of
multicores calls for their efficient parallel implementation. Though it is
known in theory that we can perform the computation of a finite automaton in
parallel by simulating transitions, its implementation has a large overhead due
to the simulation. In this paper we propose a new automaton called simultaneous
finite automaton (SFA) for efficient parallel computation of an automaton. The
key idea is to extend an automaton so that it involves the simulation of
transitions. Since an SFA itself has a good property of parallelism, we can
develop easily a parallel implementation without overheads. We have implemented
a regular expression matcher based on SFA, and it has achieved over 10-times
speedups on an environment with dual hexa-core CPUs in a typical case."
"It has been conjectured in 2011 by Brzozowski et al. that if $K$ and $L$ are
factor-free regular languages over a binary alphabet having state complexity
$m$ and $n$, resp, then the state complexity of $K\cup L$ is at most
$mn-(m+n)+3-\min\{m,n\}$.
  We disprove this conjecture by giving a lower bound of
$mn-(m+n)-2-\lfloor\frac{\min\{m,n\}-2}{2}\rfloor$, which exceeds the
conjectured bound whenever $\min\{m,n\}\geq 10$."
"We prove that a minimal automaton has a minimal adjacency matrix rank and a
minimal adjacency matrix nullity using equitable partition (from graph spectra
theory) and Nerode partition (from automata theory). This result naturally
introduces the notion of matrix rank into a regular language L, the minimal
adjacency matrix rank of a deterministic automaton that recognises L. We then
define and focus on rank-one languages: the class of languages for which the
rank of minimal automaton is one. We also define the expanded canonical
automaton of a rank-one language."
"We study programs with integer data, procedure calls and arbitrary call
graphs. We show that, whenever the guards and updates are given by octagonal
relations, the reachability problem along control flow paths within some
language w1* ... wd* over program statements is decidable in Nexptime. To
achieve this upper bound, we combine a program transformation into the same
class of programs but without procedures, with an Np-completeness result for
the reachability problem of procedure-less programs. Besides the program, the
expression w1* ... wd* is also mapped onto an expression of a similar form but
this time over the transformed program statements. Several arguments involving
context-free grammars and their generative process enable us to give tight
bounds on the size of the resulting expression. The currently existing gap
between Np-hard and Nexptime can be closed to Np-complete when a certain
parameter of the analysis is assumed to be constant."
"A deterministic finite automaton is said to be synchronizing if it has a
reset word, i.e. a word that brings all states of the automaton to a particular
one. We prove that it is a PSPACE-complete problem to check whether the
language of reset words for a given automaton coincides with the language of
reset words for some particular automaton."
"This paper introduces a new memoized derivative parsing algorithm for
recognition of parsing expression grammars. The algorithm runs in worst case
quartic time and cubic space. However, existing research suggests that due to
the limited amount of backtracking and recursion in real-world grammars and
input, practical performance may be closer to linear time and constant space;
experimental validation of this conjecture is in progress."
"The 14th International Conference Automata and Formal Languages (AFL 2014)
was held in Szeged, Hungary, from the 27th to the 29th of May, 2014. The
conference was organized by the Department of Foundations of Computer Science
of the University of Szeged. Topics of interest covered the theory and
applications of automata and formal languages and related areas."
"Eilenberg correspondence, based on the concept of syntactic monoids, relates
varieties of regular languages with pseudovarieties of finite monoids. Various
modifications of this correspondence related more general classes of regular
languages with classes of more complex algebraic objects. Such generalized
varieties also have natural counterparts formed by classes of finite automata
equipped with a certain additional algebraic structure. In this survey, we
overview several variants of such varieties of enriched automata."
"The article surveys some decidability results for DPDAs on infinite words
(omega-DPDA). We summarize some recent results on the decidability of the
regularity and the equivalence problem for the class of weak omega-DPDAs.
Furthermore, we present some new results on the parity index problem for
omega-DPDAs. For the specification of a parity condition, the states of the
omega-DPDA are assigned priorities (natural numbers), and a run is accepting if
the highest priority that appears infinitely often during a run is even. The
basic simplification question asks whether one can determine the minimal number
of priorities that are needed to accept the language of a given omega-DPDA. We
provide some decidability results on variations of this question for some
classes of omega-DPDAs."
"The decidability of equivalence for three important classes of tree
transducers is discussed. Each class can be obtained as a natural restriction
of deterministic macro tree transducers (MTTs): (1) no context parameters,
i.e., top-down tree transducers, (2) linear size increase, i.e., MSO definable
tree transducers, and (3) monadic input and output ranked alphabets. For the
full class of MTTs, decidability of equivalence remains a long-standing open
problem."
"In a recent paper (M. Barash, A. Okhotin, ""Defining contexts in context-free
grammars"", LATA 2012), the authors introduced an extension of the context-free
grammars equipped with an operator for referring to the left context of the
substring being defined. This paper proposes a more general model, in which
context specifications may be two-sided, that is, both the left and the right
contexts can be specified by the corresponding operators. The paper gives the
definitions and establishes the basic theory of such grammars, leading to a
normal form and a parsing algorithm working in time O(n^4), where n is the
length of the input string."
"We develop a formal perspective on how regular expression matching works in
Java, a popular representative of the category of regex-directed matching
engines. In particular, we define an automata model which captures all the
aspects needed to study such matching engines in a formal way. Based on this,
we propose two types of static analysis, which take a regular expression and
tell whether there exists a family of strings which makes Java-style matching
run in exponential time."
"Systems of deterministic finite automata communicating by sending their
states upon request are investigated, when the amount of communication is
restricted. The computational power and decidability properties are studied for
the case of returning centralized systems, when the number of necessary
communications during the computations of the system is bounded by a function
depending on the length of the input. It is proved that an infinite hierarchy
of language families exists, depending on the number of messages sent during
their most economical recognitions. Moreover, several properties are shown to
be not semi-decidable for the systems under consideration."
"The concept of Deterministic Finite Cover Automata (DFCA) was introduced at
WIA '98, as a more compact representation than Deterministic Finite Automata
(DFA) for finite languages. In some cases representing a finite language,
Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) may significantly reduce the number of
states used. The combined power of the succinctness of the representation of
finite languages using both cover languages and non-determinism has been
suggested, but never systematically studied. In the present paper, for
nondeterministic finite cover automata (NFCA) and l-nondeterministic finite
cover automaton (l-NFCA), we show that minimization can be as hard as
minimizing NFAs for regular languages, even in the case of NFCAs using unary
alphabets. Moreover, we show how we can adapt the methods used to reduce, or
minimize the size of NFAs/DFCAs/l-DFCAs, for simplifying NFCAs/l-NFCAs."
"In this paper, we first study the conversion of weighted two-way automata to
one-way automata. We show that this conversion preserves the unambiguity but
does not preserve the determinism. Yet, we prove that the conversion of an
unambiguous weighted one-way automaton into a two-way automaton leads to a
deterministic two-way automaton. As a consequence, we prove that unambiguous
weighted two-way automata are equivalent to deterministic weighted two-way
automata in commutative semirings."
"We study the complexity of basic regular operations on languages represented
by incomplete deterministic or nondeterministic automata, in which all states
are final. Such languages are known to be prefix-closed. We get tight bounds on
both incomplete and nondeterministic state complexity of complement,
intersection, union, concatenation, star, and reversal on prefix-closed
languages."
"Commutative languages with the semilinear property (SLIP) can be naturally
recognized by real-time NLOG-SPACE multi-counter machines. We show that unions
and concatenations of such languages can be similarly recognized, relying on --
and further developing, our recent results on the family of consensually
regular (CREG) languages. A CREG language is defined by a regular language on
the alphabet that includes the terminal alphabet and its marked copy. New
conditions, for ensuring that the union or concatenation of CREG languages is
closed, are presented and applied to the commutative SLIP languages. The paper
contributes to the knowledge of the CREG family, and introduces novel
techniques for language composition, based on arithmetic congruences that act
as language signatures. Open problems are listed."
"In this article we give two different ways of representations of circular
words. Representations with tuples are intended as a compact notation, while
representations with trees give a way to easily process all conjugates of a
word. The latter form can also be used as a graphical representation of
periodic properties of finite (in some cases, infinite) words. We also define
iterative representations which can be seen as an encoding utilizing the
flexible properties of circular words. Every word over the two letter alphabet
can be constructed starting from ab by applying the fractional power and the
cyclic shift operators one after the other, iteratively."
"We study structural restrictions on biautomata such as, e.g., acyclicity,
permutation-freeness, strongly permutation-freeness, and orderability, to
mention a few. We compare the obtained language families with those induced by
deterministic finite automata with the same property. In some cases, it is
shown that there is no difference in characterization between deterministic
finite automata and biautomata as for the permutation-freeness, but there are
also other cases, where it makes a big difference whether one considers
deterministic finite automata or biautomata. This is, for instance, the case
when comparing strongly permutation-freeness, which results in the family of
definite language for deterministic finite automata, while biautomata induce
the family of finite and co-finite languages. The obtained results nicely fall
into the known landscape on classical language families."
"In this paper we define a new descriptional complexity measure for
Deterministic Finite Automata, BC-complexity, as an alternative to the state
complexity. We prove that for two DFAs with the same number of states
BC-complexity can differ exponentially. In some cases minimization of DFA can
lead to an exponential increase in BC-complexity, on the other hand
BC-complexity of DFAs with a large state space which are obtained by some
standard constructions (determinization of NFA, language operations), is
reasonably small. But our main result is the analogue of the ""Shannon effect""
for finite automata: almost all DFAs with a fixed number of states have
BC-complexity that is close to the maximum."
"The downward and upward closures of a regular language $L$ are obtained by
collecting all the subwords and superwords of its elements, respectively. The
downward and upward interiors of $L$ are obtained dually by collecting words
having all their subwords and superwords in $L$, respectively. We provide lower
and upper bounds on the size of the smallest automata recognizing these
closures and interiors. We also consider the computational complexity of
decision problems for closures of regular languages."
"This paper revisits the solution of the word problem for $\omega$-terms
interpreted over finite aperiodic semigroups, obtained by J. McCammond. The
original proof of correctness of McCammond's algorithm, based on normal forms
for such terms, uses McCammond's solution of the word problem for certain
Burnside semigroups. In this paper, we establish a new, simpler, correctness
proof of McCammond's algorithm, based on properties of certain regular
languages associated with the normal forms. This method leads to new
applications."
"We revisit the problem of computing the edit distance of a regular language
given via an NFA. This problem relates to the inherent maximal error-detecting
capability of the language in question. We present an efficient algorithm for
solving this problem which executes in time $O(r^2n^2d)$, where $r$ is the
cardinality of the alphabet involved, $n$ is the number of transitions in the
given NFA, and $d$ is the computed edit distance. We have implemented the
algorithm and present here performance tests. The correctness of the algorithm
is based on the result (also presented here) that the particular
error-detection property related to our problem can be defined via an
input-altering transducer."
"We follow a connection between tight determinisation and complementation and
establish a complementation procedure from parity automata to nondeterministic
B\""uchi automata and prove it to be tight up to an $O(n)$ factor, where $n$ is
the size of the nondeterministic parity automaton. This factor does not depend
on the number of priorities."
"We study finite state transduction of automatic and morphic sequences.
Dekking proved that morphic sequences are closed under transduction and in
particular morphic images. We present a simple proof of this fact, and use the
construction in the proof to show that non-erasing transductions preserve a
condition called alpha-substitutivity. Roughly, a sequence is
alpha-substitutive if the sequence can be obtained as the limit of iterating a
substitution with dominant eigenvalue alpha. Our results culminate in the
following fact: for multiplicatively independent real numbers alpha and beta,
if v is an alpha-substitutive sequence and w is a beta-substitutive sequence,
then v and w have no common non-erasing transducts except for the ultimately
periodic sequences. We rely on Cobham's theorem for substitutions, a recent
result of Durand."
"This paper studies reachability, coverability and inclusion problems for
Integer Vector Addition Systems with States (ZVASS) and extensions and
restrictions thereof. A ZVASS comprises a finite-state controller with a finite
number of counters ranging over the integers. Although it is folklore that
reachability in ZVASS is NP-complete, it turns out that despite their
naturalness, from a complexity point of view this class has received little
attention in the literature. We fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis
of the computational complexity of the aforementioned decision problems. Most
interestingly, it turns out that while the addition of reset operations to
ordinary VASS leads to undecidability and Ackermann-hardness of reachability
and coverability, respectively, they can be added to ZVASS while retaining
NP-completness of both coverability and reachability."
"We focus on the family of $(k,l)$-unambiguous automata that encompasses the
one of deterministic $k$-lookahead automata introduced by Han and Wood. We show
that this family presents nice theoretical properties that allow us to compute
quasi-deterministic structures. These structures are smaller than DFAs and can
be used to solve the membership problem faster than NFAs."
"We characterize the infinite words determined by indexed languages. An
infinite language $L$ determines an infinite word $\alpha$ if every string in
$L$ is a prefix of $\alpha$. If $L$ is regular or context-free, it is known
that $\alpha$ must be ultimately periodic. We show that if $L$ is an indexed
language, then $\alpha$ is a morphic word, i.e., $\alpha$ can be generated by
iterating a morphism under a coding. Since the other direction, that every
morphic word is determined by some indexed language, also holds, this implies
that the infinite words determined by indexed languages are exactly the morphic
words. To obtain this result, we prove a new pumping lemma for the indexed
languages, which may be of independent interest."
"This paper proposes an extension to classical regular expressions by the
addition of two operators allowing the inclusion of boolean formulae from the
zeroth order logic. These expressions are called constrained expressions. The
associated language is defined thanks to the notion of interpretation and of
realization.
  We show that the language associated when both interpretation and realization
are fixed is stricly regular and can be not regular otherwise.
  Furthermore, we use an extension of Antimirov partial derivatives in order to
solve the membership test in the general case. Finally, we show that once the
interpretation is fixed, the membership test of a word in the language denoted
by a constrained expression can be undecidable whereas it is always decidable
when the interpretation is not fixed."
"Given a regular language $L$, we study the language of words $\mathsf{D}(L)$,
that distinguish between pairs of different left-quotients of $L$. We
characterize this distinguishability operation, show that its iteration has
always a fixed point, and we generalize this result to operations derived from
closure operators and Boolean operators. We give an upper bound for the state
complexity of the distinguishability operation, and prove its tightness. We
show that the set of minimal words that can be used to distinguish between
different left-quotients of a language $L$ has at most $n-1$ elements, where
$n$ is the state complexity of $L$, and we also study the properties of its
iteration. We generalize the results for the languages of words that
distinguish between pairs of different right-quotients and two-sided quotients
of a language $L$."
"The notion of linear finite transducer (LFT) plays a crucial role in some
cryptographic systems. In this paper we present a way to get an approximate
value, by random sampling, for the number of non-equivalent injective LFTs. By
introducing a recurrence relation to count canonical LFTs, we show how to
estimate the percentage of $\tau$-injective LFTs. Several experimental results
are presented, which by themselves constitute an important step towards the
evaluation of the key space of those systems."
"Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are used to define distributions
over strings, and are powerful modelling tools in a number of areas, including
natural language processing, software engineering, model checking,
bio-informatics, and pattern recognition. A common important question is that
of comparing the distributions generated or modelled by these grammars: this is
done through checking language equivalence and computing distances. Two PCFGs
are language equivalent if every string has identical probability with both
grammars. This also means that the distance (whichever norm is used) is null.
It is known that the language equivalence problem is interreducible with that
of multiple ambiguity for context-free grammars, a long-standing open question.
In this work, we prove that computing distances corresponds to solving
undecidable questions: this is the case for the L1, L2 norm, the variation
distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Two more results are less
negative: 1. The most probable string can be computed, and, 2. The Chebyshev
distance (where the distance between two distributions is the maximum
difference of probabilities over all strings) is interreducible with the
language equivalence problem."
"An automaton is monotonic if its states can be arranged in a linear order
that is preserved by the action of every letter. We prove that the problem of
deciding whether a given automaton is monotonic is NP-complete. The same result
is obtained for oriented automata, whose states can be arranged in a cyclic
order. Moreover, both problems remain hard under the restriction to binary
input alphabets."
"Brzozowski derivatives of a regular expression are developed for constructing
deterministic automata from the given regular expression in the algebraic way.
In this paper,some lemmas of the regular expressions are discussed and the
regular languages of the derivatives are illustrated. Also the generalizations
of the Brzozowski derivatives are proved as theorems with help of properties
and known results."
"Context-free S grammars are introduced, for arbitrary (storage) type S, as a
uniform framework for recursion-based grammars, automata, and transducers,
viewed as programs. To each occurrence of a nonterminal of a context-free S
grammar an object of type S is associated, that can be acted upon by tests and
operations, as indicated in the rules of the grammar. Taking particular storage
types gives particular formalisms, such as indexed grammars, top-down tree
transducers, attribute grammars, etc. Context-free S grammars are equivalent to
pushdown S automata. The context-free S languages can be obtained from the
deterministic one-way S automaton languages by way of the delta operations on
languages, introduced in this paper."
"We report on simulation, hierarchy, and decidability results for Practical
Regular Expressions (PRE), which may include back references in addition to the
standard operations union, concatenation, and star.
  The following results are obtained:
  PRE can be simulated by the classical model of nondeterministic finite
automata with sensing one-way heads. The number of heads depends on the number
of different variables in the expressions.
  A space bound O(n log m) for matching a text of length m with a PRE with n
variables based on the previous simulation. This improves the bound O(nm) from
(C\^ampeanu and Santean 2009).
  PRE cannot be simulated by deterministic finite automata with at most three
sensing one-way heads or deterministic finite automata with any number of
non-sensing one-way heads.
  PRE with a bounded number of occurrences of variables in any match can be
simulated by nondeterministic finite automata with one-way heads.
  There is a tight hierarchy of PRE with a growing number of non-nested
variables over a fixed alphabet. A previously known hierarchy was based on
nested variables and growing alphabets (Larsen 1998).
  Matching of PRE without star over a single-letter alphabet is NP-complete.
This strengthens the corresponding result for expressions over larger alphabets
and with star (Aho 1990).
  Inequivalence of PRE without closure operators is Sigma^P_2-complete.
  The decidability of universality of PRE over a single letter alphabet is
linked to the existence of Fermat Primes.
  Greibach's Theorem applies to languages characterized by PRE."
"A celebrated result of Sch\""utzenberger says that a language is star-free if
and only if it is is recognized by a finite aperiodic monoid. We give a new
proof for this theorem using local divisors."
"The \v{C}ern\'y conjecture states that every $n$-state synchronizing
automaton has a reset word of length at most $(n-1)^2$. We study the hardness
of finding short reset words. It is known that the exact version of the
problem, i.e., finding the shortest reset word, is NP-hard and coNP-hard, and
complete for the DP class, and that approximating the length of the shortest
reset word within a factor of $O(\log n)$ is NP-hard [Gerbush and Heeringa,
CIAA'10], even for the binary alphabet [Berlinkov, DLT'13]. We significantly
improve on these results by showing that, for every $\epsilon>0$, it is NP-hard
to approximate the length of the shortest reset word within a factor of
$n^{1-\epsilon}$. This is essentially tight since a simple $O(n)$-approximation
algorithm exists."
"We consider the synthesis of deterministic tree transducers from automaton
definable specifications, given as binary relations, over finite trees. We
consider the case of specifications that are deterministic top-down tree
automatic, meaning the specification is recognizable by a deterministic
top-down tree automaton that reads the two given trees synchronously in
parallel. In this setting we study tree transducers that are allowed to have
either bounded delay or arbitrary delay. Delay is caused whenever the
transducer reads a symbol from the input tree but does not produce output. We
provide decision procedures for both bounded and arbitrary delay that yield
deterministic top-down tree transducers which realize the specification for
valid input trees. Similar to the case of relations over words, we use
two-player games to obtain our results."
"In this paper, we define the class of hourglass automata, which are timed
automata with bounded clocks that can be made to progress backwards as well as
forwards at a constant rate. We then introduce a new clock update for timed
automata that allows hourglass automata to be expressed. This allows us to show
that language emptiness remains decidable with this update when the number of
clocks is two or less. This is done by showing that we can construct a finite
untimed graph using clock regions from any timed automaton that use this new
update."
"Automata for unordered unranked trees are relevant for defining schemas and
queries for data trees in Json or Xml format. While the existing notions are
well-investigated concerning expressiveness, they all lack a proper notion of
determinism, which makes it difficult to distinguish subclasses of automata for
which problems such as inclusion, equivalence, and minimization can be solved
efficiently. In this paper, we propose and investigate different notions of
""horizontal determinism"", starting from automata for unranked trees in which
the horizontal evaluation is performed by finite state automata. We show that a
restriction to confluent horizontal evaluation leads to polynomial-time
emptiness and universality, but still suffers from coNP-completeness of the
emptiness of binary intersections. Finally, efficient algorithms can be
obtained by imposing an order of horizontal evaluation globally for all
automata in the class. Depending on the choice of the order, we obtain
different classes of automata, each of which has the same expressiveness as
CMso."
"There has been a growing interest in defining models of automata enriched
with time. For instance, timed automata were introduced as automata extended
with clocks. In this paper, we study models of timed finite state machines
(TFSMs), i.e., FSMs enriched with time, which accept timed input words and
generate timed output words. Here we discuss some models of TFSMs with a single
clock: TFSMs with timed guards, TFSMs with timeouts, and TFSMs with both timed
guards and timeouts. We solve the problem of equivalence checking for all three
models, and we compare their expressive power, characterizing subclasses of
TFSMs with timed guards and of TFSMs with timeouts that are equivalent to each
other."
"In this article, we study classes of multidimensional subshifts defined by
multihead finite automata, in particular the hierarchy of classes of subshifts
defined as the number of heads grows. The hierarchy collapses on the third
level, where all co-recursively enumerable subshifts are obtained in every
dimension. We also compare these classes to SFTs and sofic shifts. We are
unable to separate the second and third level of the hierarchy in one and two
dimensions, and suggest a related open problem for two-counter machines."
"The separability problem for word languages of a class $\mathcal{C}$ by
languages of a class $\mathcal{S}$ asks, for two given languages $I$ and $E$
from $\mathcal{C}$, whether there exists a language $S$ from $\mathcal{S}$ that
includes $I$ and excludes $E$, that is, $I \subseteq S$ and $S\cap E =
\emptyset$. In this work, we assume some mild closure properties for
$\mathcal{C}$ and study for which such classes $\mathcal{C}$ separability by
piecewise testable languages (PTL) is decidable. We characterize these classes
in terms of decidability of (two variants of) an unboundedness problem. From
this we deduce that separability by PTL is decidable for a number of language
classes, such as the context-free languages and languages of labeled vector
addition systems. Furthermore, it follows that separability by PTL is decidable
if and only if one can compute for any language of the class its downward
closure with respect to the scattered substring ordering (i.e., if the set of
scattered substrings of any language of the class is effectively regular).
  The obtained decidability results contrast known undecidability results. In
fact, for all the (non-regular) language classes we present as examples with
decidable separability, it is undecidable whether a given language is a PTL
itself.
  Our characterization involves a result of independent interest, which states
that for any kind of languages $I$ and $E$, non-separability is equivalent to
the existence of common patterns in $I$ and $E$."
"In this paper we prove the equivalence of sequential, Mealy-type and
Moore-type weighted finite automata with output, with respect to various
semantics which are defined here."
"We answer two open questions by (Gruber, Holzer, Kutrib, 2009) on the
state-complexity of representing sub- or superword closures of context-free
grammars (CFGs): (1) We prove a (tight) upper bound of $2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$ on
the size of nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) representing the subword
closure of a CFG of size $n$. (2) We present a family of CFGs for which the
minimal deterministic finite automata representing their subword closure
matches the upper-bound of $2^{2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ following from (1).
Furthermore, we prove that the inequivalence problem for NFAs representing sub-
or superword-closed languages is only NP-complete as opposed to PSPACE-complete
for general NFAs. Finally, we extend our results into an approximation method
to attack inequivalence problems for CFGs."
"This paper presents a new solution to the containment problem for extended
regular expressions that extends basic regular expressions with intersection
and complement operators and consider regular expressions on infinite alphabets
based on potentially infinite character sets. Standard approaches deciding the
containment do not take extended operators or character sets into account. The
algorithm avoids the translation to an expression-equivalent automaton and
provides a purely symbolic term rewriting systems for solving regular
expressions inequalities.
  We give a new symbolic decision procedure for the containment problem based
on Brzozowski's regular expression derivatives and Antimirov's rewriting
approach to check containment. We generalize Brzozowski's syntactic derivative
operator to two derivative operators that work with respect to (potentially
infinite) representable character sets."
"The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over
finite words: are there words accepted by the automaton with arbitrarily high
probability? Although undecidable, this problem attracted a lot of attention
over the last few years. The aim of this paper is to review and relate the
results pertaining to the value 1 problem. In particular, several algorithms
have been proposed to partially solve this problem. We show the relations
between them, leading to the following conclusion: the Markov Monoid Algorithm
is the most correct algorithm known to (partially) solve the value 1 problem."
"Cerny's conjecture is a longstanding open problem in automata theory. We
study two different concepts, which allow to approach it from a new angle. The
first one is the triple rendezvous time, i.e., the length of the shortest word
mapping three states onto a single one. The second one is the synchronizing
probability function of an automaton, a recently introduced tool which
reinterprets the synchronizing phenomenon as a two-player game, and allows to
obtain optimal strategies through a Linear Program.
  Our contribution is twofold. First, by coupling two different novel
approaches based on the synchronizing probability function and properties of
linear programming, we obtain a new upper bound on the triple rendezvous time.
Second, by exhibiting a family of counterexamples, we disprove a conjecture on
the growth of the synchronizing probability function. We then suggest natural
follow-ups towards Cernys conjecture."
"We model collapsible and ordered pushdown systems with term rewriting, by
encoding higher-order stacks and multiple stacks into trees. We show a uniform
inverse preservation of recognizability result for the resulting class of term
rewriting systems, which is obtained by extending the classic saturation-based
approach. This result subsumes and unifies similar analyses on collapsible and
ordered pushdown systems. Despite the rich literature on inverse preservation
of recognizability for term rewrite systems, our result does not seem to follow
from any previous study."
"Recently, Schlicht and Stephan lifted the notion of automatic-structures to
the notion of (finite-word) ordinal-automatic structures. These are structures
whose domain and relations can be represented by automata reading finite words
whose shape is some fixed ordinal $\alpha$. We lift Delhomm\'e's
relative-growth-technique from the automatic and tree-automatic setting to the
ordinal-automatic setting. This result implies that the random graph is not
ordinal-automatic and infinite integral domains are not ordinal-automatic with
respect to ordinals below $\omega_1+\omega^\omega$ where $\omega_1$ is the
first uncountable ordinal."
"We consider the problem of minimising the number of states in a multiplicity
tree automaton over the field of rational numbers. We give a minimisation
algorithm that runs in polynomial time assuming unit-cost arithmetic. We also
show that a polynomial bound in the standard Turing model would require a
breakthrough in the complexity of polynomial identity testing by proving that
the latter problem is logspace equivalent to the decision version of
minimisation. The developed techniques also improve the state of the art in
multiplicity word automata: we give an NC algorithm for minimising multiplicity
word automata. Finally, we consider the minimal consistency problem: does there
exist an automaton with $n$ states that is consistent with a given finite
sample of weight-labelled words or trees? We show that this decision problem is
complete for the existential theory of the rationals, both for words and for
trees of a fixed alphabet rank."
"Determinization of fuzzy finite automata is understood here as a procedure of
their conversion into equivalent crisp-deterministic fuzzy automata, which can
be viewed as being deterministic with possibly infinitely many states, but with
fuzzy sets of terminal states. Particularly significant determinization methods
are those that provide a minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton equivalent
to the original fuzzy finite automaton, called canonization methods. One
canonization method for fuzzy finite automata, the Brzozowski type
determinization, has been developed recently by Jan\v{c}i\'{c} and
\'{C}iri\'{c} in [10]. Here we provide another canonization method for a fuzzy
finite automaton $\cal A=(A,\sigma, \delta,\tau)$ over a complete residuated
lattice $\cal L$, based on the degrees of inclusion of the right fuzzy
languages associated with states of $\cal A$ into the left derivatives of the
fuzzy language recognized by $\cal A$. The proposed procedure terminates in a
finite number of steps whenever the membership values taken by $\delta $,
$\sigma $ and $\tau $ generate a finite subsemiring of the semiring reduct of
$\cal L$. This procedure is generally faster than the Brzozowski type
determinization, and if the basic operations in the residuated lattice $\cal L$
can be performed in constant time, it has the same computational time as all
other determinization procedures provided in [8], [11], [12]."
"We formalize and analyze a new automata-theoretic problem termed control
improvisation. Given an automaton, the problem is to produce an improviser, a
probabilistic algorithm that randomly generates words in its language, subject
to two additional constraints: the satisfaction of an admissibility predicate,
and the exhibition of a specified amount of randomness. Control improvisation
has multiple applications, including, for example, generating musical
improvisations that satisfy rhythmic and melodic constraints, where
admissibility is determined by some bounded divergence from a reference melody.
We analyze the complexity of the control improvisation problem, giving cases
where it is efficiently solvable and cases where it is #P-hard or undecidable.
We also show how symbolic techniques based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
solvers can be used to approximately solve some of the intractable cases."
"We present here the proof for an alternative procedure to convert a Push Down
Automata (PDA) into a Context Free Grammar (CFG). The procedure involves
intermediate conversion to a single state PDA. In view of the authors, this
conversion is conceptually intuitive and can serve as a teaching aid for the
relevant topics."
"To deal with system uncertainty, finite automata have been generalized into
fuzzy automata. Stamenkovic and Ciric proposed an approach using the position
automata for the construction of fuzzy automata from fuzzy regular expressions.
There exist multifarious methodologies for the construction of finite automata
from regular expressions known as Thompson construction, Antimirov partial
derivatives, Glushkov automata and follow automata etc. In this paper, we
propose an approach for the conversion of fuzzy regular expressions into fuzzy
automata using the concept of follow automata. The number of states of the
obtained Fuzzy automata using the proposed approach is lesser than the extant
approaches in the literature."
"Often, when analyzing the behaviour of systems modelled as context-free
languages, we wish to know if two languages overlap. To this end, we present an
effective semi-decision procedure for regular separability of context-free
languages, based on counter-example guided abstraction refinement. We propose
two refinement methods, one inexpensive but incomplete, and the other complete
but more expensive. We provide an experimental evaluation of this procedure,
and demonstrate its practicality on a range of verification and
language-theoretic instances."
"This paper explores and clarifies several issues surrounding Zeno machines
and the issue of running a Turing machine for infinite time. Without a minimum
hypothetical bound on physical conditions, any magical machine can be created,
and therefore, a thesis on the bound is formulated. This paper then proves that
the halting problem algorithm for every Turing-recognizable program and every
input cannot be devised whatever method is used to exploit infinite
running-time of Turing machine."
"We present a new and powerful class of automata which are explicitly
concurrent and allow a very simple definition of composition. The novelty of
these automata is their time-synchronous message-asynchronous communication
mechanism. Time synchrony is obtained by using global clock. Message asynchrony
is obtained by requiring the automata to react to every input. Explicit
concurrency is obtained by marking each transition with a set of input and
output messages. We compare these automata with a history based approach which
uses the same communication mechanism and show that they are equivalent."
"The quotient operation, which is dual to the composition, is crucial in
specification theories as it allows the synthesis of missing specifications and
thus enables incremental design. In this paper, we consider a specification
theory based on marked acceptance specifications (MAS) which are automata
enriched with variability information encoded by acceptance sets and with
reachability constraints on states. We define a sound and complete quotient for
MAS hence ensuring reachability properties by construction."
"We investigate the length $\ell(n,k)$ of a shortest preset distinguishing
sequence (PDS) in the worst case for a $k$-element subset of an $n$-state Mealy
automaton. It was mentioned by Sokolovskii that this problem is closely related
to the problem of finding the maximal subsemigroup diameter
$\ell(\mathbf{T}_n)$ for the full transformation semigroup $\mathbf{T}_n$ of an
$n$-element set. We prove that
$\ell(\mathbf{T}_n)=2^n\exp\{\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}\ln n}(1+ o(1))\}$ as
$n\to\infty$ and, using approach of Sokolovskii, find the asymptotics of
$\log_2 \ell(n,k)$ as $n,k\to\infty$ and $k/n\to a\in (0,1)$."
"By the Road Coloring Theorem (Trahtman, 2008), the edges of any aperiodic
directed multigraph with a constant out-degree can be colored such that the
resulting automaton admits a reset word. There may also be a need for a
particular reset word to be admitted. For certain words it is NP-complete to
decide whether there is a suitable coloring of a given multigraph. We present a
classification of all words over the binary alphabet that separates such words
from those that make the problem solvable in polynomial time. We show that the
classification becomes different if we consider only strongly connected
multigraphs. In this restricted setting the classification remains incomplete."
"The model of tree automata with equality and disequality constraints was
introduced in 2007 by Filiot, Talbot and Tison. In this paper we show that if
there is at least one disequality constraint, the emptiness problem is NP-hard."
"We provide a counterexample to a lemma used in a recent tentative improvement
of the the Pin-Frankl bound for synchronizing automata. This example naturally
leads us to formulate an open question, whose answer could fix the line of
proof, and improve the bound."
"For a non-negative integer $k$, a language is $k$-piecewise test\-able
($k$-PT) if it is a finite boolean combination of languages of the form
$\Sigma^* a_1 \Sigma^* \cdots \Sigma^* a_n \Sigma^*$ for $a_i\in\Sigma$ and
$0\le n \le k$. We study the following problem: Given a DFA recognizing a
piecewise testable language, decide whether the language is $k$-PT. We provide
a complexity bound and a detailed analysis for small $k$'s. The result can be
used to find the minimal $k$ for which the language is $k$-PT. We show that the
upper bound on $k$ given by the depth of the minimal DFA can be exponentially
bigger than the minimal possible $k$, and provide a tight upper bound on the
depth of the minimal DFA recognizing a $k$-PT language."
"We solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We prove that the
cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a suffix-free language with $n$ left
quotients (that is, with state complexity $n$) is at most $(n-1)^{n-2}+n-2$ for
$n\ge 6$. Since this bound is known to be reachable, this settles the problem.
We also reduce the alphabet of the witness languages reaching this bound to
five letters instead of $n+2$, and show that it cannot be any smaller. Finally,
we prove that the transition semigroup of a minimal deterministic automaton
accepting a witness language is unique for each $n$."
"We consider the cyclic closure of a language, and its generalisation to the
operators $C^k$ introduced by Brandst\""adt. We prove that the cyclic closure of
an indexed language is indexed, and that if $L$ is a context-free language then
$C^k(L)$ is indexed."
"Given a non-deterministic timed automaton with silent transitions (eNTA), we
compute its timestamp: the set of all time values on which any observable
transition occurs, and also a deterministic timed automaton with the same
timestamp. The timestamp is eventually periodic and is constructed via a finite
periodic augmented region automaton. A consequence of this construction is the
periodicity of the language of timed automata with respect to suffixes.
Applications include the decidability of the 1-bounded language inclusion
problem for eNTA, and a partial method, not bounded by time or number of steps,
for the general language non-inclusion problem for eNTA."
"We follow language theoretic approach to synchronizing automata and
\v{C}ern\'{y}'s conjecture initiated in a series of recent papers. We find a
precise lower bound for the reset complexity of a principal ideal languages.
Also we show a strict connection between principal left ideals and
synchronizing automata. We characterize regular languages whose minimal
deterministic finite automaton is synchronizing and possesses a reset word
belonging to the recognized language."
"We refine a uniform algebraic approach for deriving upper bounds on reset
thresholds of synchronizing automata. We express the condition that an
automaton is synchronizing in terms of linear algebra, and obtain upper bounds
for the reset thresholds of automata with a short word of a small rank. The
results are applied to make several improvements in the area.
  We improve the best general upper bound for reset thresholds of finite prefix
codes (Huffman codes): we show that an $n$-state synchronizing decoder has a
reset word of length at most $O(n \log^3 n)$. In addition to that, we prove
that the expected reset threshold of a uniformly random synchronizing binary
$n$-state decoder is at most $O(n \log n)$. We also show that for any non-unary
alphabet there exist decoders whose reset threshold is in $\varTheta(n)$.
  We prove the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture for $n$-state automata with a letter of
rank at most $\sqrt[3]{6n-6}$. In another corollary, based on the recent
results of Nicaud, we show that the probability that the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture
does not hold for a random synchronizing binary automaton is exponentially
small in terms of the number of states, and also that the expected value of the
reset threshold of an $n$-state random synchronizing binary automaton is at
most $n^{3/2+o(1)}$.
  Moreover, reset words of lengths within all of our bounds are computable in
polynomial time. We present suitable algorithms for this task for various
classes of automata, such as (quasi-)one-cluster and (quasi-)Eulerian automata,
for which our results can be applied."
A sequence function alternative representation of state machines.
"We investigate two problems for a class C of regular word languages. The
C-membership problem asks for an algorithm to decide whether an input language
belongs to C. The C-separation problem asks for an algorithm that, given as
input two regular languages, decides whether there exists a third language in C
containing the first language, while being disjoint from the second. These
problems are considered as means to obtain a deep understanding of the class C.
  It is usual for such classes to be defined by logical formalisms. Logics are
often built on top of each other, by adding new predicates. A natural
construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this paper,
we obtain simple self-contained proofs of two transfer results: we show that
for suitable logically defined classes, the membership, resp. the separation
problem for a class enriched with the successor relation reduces to the same
problem for the original class.
  Our reductions work both for languages of finite words and infinite words.
The proofs are mostly self-contained, and only require a basic background on
regular languages. This paper therefore gives new, simple proofs of results
that were considered as difficult, such as the decid- ability of the membership
problem for the levels 1, 3/2, 2 and 5/2 of the dot-depth hierarchy."
"We define and study basic properties of *-continuous Kleene $\omega$-algebras
that involve a *-continuous Kleene algebra with a *-continuous action on a
semimodule and an infinite product operation that is also *-continuous. We show
that *-continuous Kleene $\omega$-algebras give rise to iteration
semiring-semimodule pairs. We show how our work can be applied to solve certain
energy problems for hybrid systems."
"Traditional language processing tools constrain language designers to
specific kinds of grammars. In contrast, model-based language processing tools
decouple language design from language processing. These tools allow the
occurrence of lexical and syntactic ambiguities in language specifications and
the declarative specification of constraints for resolving them. As a result,
these techniques require scanners and parsers able to parse context-free
grammars, handle ambiguities, and enforce constraints for disambiguation. In
this paper, we present Lamb and Fence. Lamb is a scanning algorithm that
supports ambiguous token definitions and the specification of custom pattern
matchers and constraints. Fence is a chart parsing algorithm that supports
ambiguous context-free grammars and the definition of constraints on
associativity, composition, and precedence, as well as custom constraints. Lamb
and Fence, in conjunction, enable the implementation of the ModelCC model-based
language processing tool."
"We will prove that the word $a^ib^ja^k$ is periodicity forcing if $j \geq 3$
and $i+k \geq 3$, where $i$ and $k$ are positive integers. Also we will give
examples showing that both bounds are optimal."
"In this paper, we define a new kind of weighted tree automata where the
weights are only supported by final states. We show that these automata are
sequentializable and we study their closures under classical regular and
algebraic operations. We then use these automata to compute the subtree kernel
of two finite tree languages in an efficient way. Finally, we present some
perspectives involving the root-weighted tree automata."
"We consider commutative regular and context-free grammars, or, in other
words, Parikh images of regular and context-free languages. By using linear
algebra and a branching analog of the classic Euler theorem, we show that,
under an assumption that the terminal alphabet is fixed, the membership problem
for regular grammars (given v in binary and a regular commutative grammar G,
does G generate v?) is P, and that the equivalence problem for context free
grammars (do G_1 and G_2 generate the same language?) is in $\mathrm{\Pi_2^P}$."
"Linear constraint transformation is an essential step to solve the forbidden
state problem in Petri nets that contain uncontrollable transitions. This work
studies the equivalent transformation from a legal-marking set to its
admissible-marking set given such a net. First, the concepts of an
escaping-marking set and a transforming marking set are defined. Based on them,
two algorithms are given to compute the admissible-marking set and the
transforming marking set, which establish the theoretical foundation for the
equivalent transformation of linear constraints. Second, the theory about the
equivalent transformation of a disjunction of linear constraints imposed to
Petri nets with uncontrollable transitions is established. Third, two rules are
given to decide the priority of transitions for transformation. Finally, the
transformation procedure from a given linear constraint to a logic expression
of linear constraints that can describe its entire admissible-marking set is
illustrated via two examples."
"Encodings, that is, injective functions from words to words, have been
studied extensively in several settings. In computability theory the notion of
encoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as
for comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much
attention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions.
  A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective
encoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but
its pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the
affirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective
encoding f such that for every language L in C its image f[L] is regular.
  Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences.
Firstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect
to a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not
required to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented,
in this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence
deterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine
deciders.
  A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers
via number representations and finite automata. A set of numbers is said to be
recognizable with respect to a representation if an automaton accepts the
language of representations. Our result entails that there is one number
representation with respect to which every recursive set is recognizable."
"We prove that the multivariate zeta function of a sofic-Dyck shift is the
commutative series of some visibly pushdown language. As a consequence the zeta
function of a sofic-Dyck shift is the generating function of a visibly pushdown
language and is thus an $\mathbb{N}$-algebraic series."
"We study the problem of constructing approximations to a weighted automaton.
Weighted finite automata (WFA) are closely related to the theory of rational
series. A rational series is a function from strings to real numbers that can
be computed by a finite WFA. Among others, this includes probability
distributions generated by hidden Markov models and probabilistic automata. The
relationship between rational series and WFA is analogous to the relationship
between regular languages and ordinary automata. Associated with such rational
series are infinite matrices called Hankel matrices which play a fundamental
role in the theory of minimal WFA. Our contributions are: (1) an effective
procedure for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of such infinite
Hankel matrices based on their representation in terms of finite WFA; (2) a new
canonical form for finite WFA based on this SVD decomposition; and, (3) an
algorithm to construct approximate minimizations of a given WFA. The goal of
our approximate minimization algorithm is to start from a minimal WFA and
produce a smaller WFA that is close to the given one in a certain sense. The
desired size of the approximating automaton is given as input. We give bounds
describing how well the approximation emulates the behavior of the original
WFA."
"Arden's Lemma is a classical result in language theory allowing the
computation of a rational expression denoting the language recognized by a
finite string automaton. In this paper we generalize this important lemma to
the rational tree languages. Moreover, we propose also a construction of a
rational tree expression which denotes the accepted tree language of a finite
tree automaton."
"Yamakami [2011, Theoret. Comput. Sci.] studies context-free languages with
advice functions. Here, the length of an advice is assumed to be the same as
that of an input. Let CFL and CFL/n denote the class of all context-free
languages and that with advice functions, respectively. We let CFL(2) denote
the class of intersections of two context-free languages. An interesting
direction of a research is asking how complex CFL(2) is, relative to CFL.
Yamakami raised a problem whether there is a CFL-immune set in CFL(2) - CFL/n.
The best known so far is that LSPACE - CFL/n has a CFL-immune set, where LSPACE
denotes the class of languages recognized in logarithmic-space. We present an
affirmative solution to his problem. Two key concepts of our proof are the
nested palindrome and Yamakami's swapping lemma. The swapping lemma is
applicable to the setting where the pumping lemma (Bar-Hillel's lemma) does not
work. Our proof is an example showing how useful the swapping lemma is."
"This paper investigates reversibility properties of 1-dimensional
3-neighborhood d-state finite cellular automata (CAs) under periodic boundary
condition. A tool named reachability tree has been developed from de Bruijn
graph which represents all possible reachable configurations of an n-cell CA.
This tool has been used to test reversibility of CAs. We have identified a
large set of reversible CAs using this tool by following some greedy
strategies. Our conjecture is that the reversible CAs, defined over infinite
lattice, are always reversible when the CAs are finite. However, the reverse
may not be true."
"This text is an extended version of the chapter 'Automata and rational
expressions' in the AutoMathA Handbook that will appear soon, published by the
European Science Foundation and edited by JeanEricPin."
"This text is devoted to the theory of varieties, which provides an important
tool, based in universal algebra, for the classification of regular languages.
In the introductory section, we present a number of examples that illustrate
and motivate the fundamental concepts. We do this for the most part without
proofs, and often without precise definitions, leaving these to the formal
development of the theory that begins in Section 2. Our presentation of the
theory draws heavily on the work of Gehrke, Grigorieff and Pin (2008) on the
equational theory of lattices of regular languages. In the subsequent sections
we consider in more detail aspects of varieties that were only briefly evoked
in the introduction: Decidability, operations on languages, and
characterizations in formal logic."
"Higher-order pushdown systems and ground tree rewriting systems can be seen
as extensions of suffix word rewriting systems. Both classes generate infinite
graphs with interesting logical properties. Indeed, the model-checking problem
for monadic second order logic (respectively first order logic with a
reachability predicate) is decidable on such graphs. We unify both models by
introducing the notion of stack trees, trees whose nodes are labelled by
higher-order stacks, and define the corresponding class of higher-order ground
tree rewriting systems. We show that these graphs retain the decidability
properties of ground tree rewriting graphs while generalising the pushdown
hierarchy of graphs."
"Annotated pushdown automata provide an automaton model of higher-order
recursion schemes, which may in turn be used to model higher-order programs for
the purposes of verification. We study Ground Annotated Stack Tree Rewrite
Systems -- a tree rewrite system where each node is labelled by the
configuration of an annotated pushdown automaton. This allows the modelling of
fork and join constructs in higher-order programs and is a generalisation of
higher-order stack trees recently introduced by Penelle.
  We show that, given a regular set of annotated stack trees, the set of trees
that can reach this set is also regular, and constructible in n-EXPTIME for an
order-n system, which is optimal. We also show that our construction can be
extended to allow a global state through which unrelated nodes of the tree may
communicate, provided the number of communications is subject to a fixed bound."
"The word position automaton was introduced by Glushkov and McNaughton in the
early 1960. This automaton is homogeneous and has (||\E||+1) states for a word
expression of alphabetic width ||\E||. This kind of automata is extended to
regular tree expressions.
  In this paper, we give an efficient algorithm that computes the \Follow sets,
which are used in different algorithms of conversion of a regular expression
into tree automata. In the following, we consider the k-position tree automaton
construction. We prove that for a regular expression \E of a size |\E| and
alphabetic width ||\E||, the \Follow sets can be computed in O(||\E||\cdot
|\E|) time complexity."
"Consider the set of those binary words with no non-empty factors of the form
$xxx^R$. Du, Mousavi, Schaeffer, and Shallit asked whether this set of words
grows polynomially or exponentially with length. In this paper, we demonstrate
the existence of upper and lower bounds on the number of such words of length
$n$, where each of these bounds is asymptotically equivalent to a (different)
function of the form $Cn^{\lg n+c}$, where $C$, $c$ are constants."
"We generalize the partial derivative automaton to regular expressions with
shuffle and study its size in the worst and in the average case. The number of
states of the partial derivative automata is in the worst case at most 2^m,
where m is the number of letters in the expression, while asymptotically and on
average it is no more than (4/3)^m."
"We investigate regular realizability (RR) problems, which are the problems of
verifying whether intersection of a regular language -- the input of the
problem -- and fixed language called filter is non-empty. In this paper we
focus on the case of context-free filters. Algorithmic complexity of the RR
problem is a very coarse measure of context-free languages complexity. This
characteristic is compatible with rational dominance. We present examples of
P-complete RR problems as well as examples of RR problems in the class NL. Also
we discuss RR problems with context-free filters that might have intermediate
complexity. Possible candidates are the languages with polynomially bounded
rational indices."
"The downward closure of a word language is the set of all (not necessarily
contiguous) subwords of its members. It is well-known that the downward closure
of any language is regular. While the downward closure appears to be a powerful
abstraction, algorithms for computing a finite automaton for the downward
closure of a given language have been established only for few language
classes.
  This work presents a simple general method for computing downward closures.
For language classes that are closed under rational transductions, it is shown
that the computation of downward closures can be reduced to checking a certain
unboundedness property.
  This result is used to prove that downward closures are computable for (i)
every language class with effectively semilinear Parikh images that are closed
under rational transductions, (ii) matrix languages, and (iii) indexed
languages (equivalently, languages accepted by higher-order pushdown automata
of order 2)."
"A (left) quotient of a language $L$ by a word $w$ is the language
$w^{-1}L=\{x\mid wx\in L\}$. The quotient complexity of a regular language $L$
is the number of quotients of $L$; it is equal to the state complexity of $L$,
which is the number of states in a minimal deterministic finite automaton
accepting $L$. An atom of $L$ is an equivalence class of the relation in which
two words are equivalent if for each quotient, they either are both in the
quotient or both not in it; hence it is a non-empty intersection of
complemented and uncomplemented quotients of $L$. A right (respectively, left
and two-sided) ideal is a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ that satisfies
$L=L\Sigma^*$ (respectively, $L=\Sigma^*L$ and $L=\Sigma^*L\Sigma^*$). We
compute the maximal number of atoms and the maximal quotient complexities of
atoms of right, left and two-sided regular ideals."
"It has been shown recently (Shalygo, 2014) that stationary and dynamic
patterns can arise in the proposed one-component model of the analog
(continuous state) kinetic automaton, or kinon for short, defined as a
reflexive dynamical system with active transport. This paper presents
extensions of the model, which increase further its complexity and tunability,
and shows that the extended kinon model can produce spatio-temporal patterns
pertaining not only to pattern formation but also to morphogenesis in real
physical and biological systems. The possible applicability of the model to
morphogenetic engineering and swarm robotics is also discussed."
"Does the trace language of a given vector addition system (VAS) intersect
with a given context-free language? This question lies at the heart of several
verification questions involving recursive programs with integer parameters. In
particular, it is equivalent to the coverability problem for VAS that operate
on a pushdown stack. We show decidability in dimension one, based on an
analysis of a new model called grammar-controlled vector addition systems."
"We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given string can be
factored into palindromes that are each unique in the factorization."
"We consider several novel aspects of unique factorization in formal
languages. We reprove the familiar fact that the set uf(L) of words having
unique factorization into elements of L is regular if L is regular, and from
this deduce an quadratic upper and lower bound on the length of the shortest
word not in uf(L). We observe that uf(L) need not be context-free if L is
context-free.
  Next, we consider variations on unique factorization. We define a notion of
""semi-unique"" factorization, where every factorization has the same number of
terms, and show that, if L is regular or even finite, the set of words having
such a factorization need not be context-free. Finally, we consider additional
variations, such as unique factorization ""up to permutation"" and ""up to
subset""."
"Shuffle projection is motivated by the verification of safety properties of
special parameterized systems. Basic definitions and properties, especially
related to alphabetic homomorphisms, are presented. The relation between
iterated shuffle products and shuffle projections is shown. A special class of
multi-counter automata is introduced, to formulate shuffle projection in terms
of computations of these automata represented by transductions. This
reformulation of shuffle projection leads to construction principles for pairs
of languages closed under shuffle projection. Additionally, it is shown that
under certain conditions these transductions are rational, which implies
decidability of closure against shuffle projection. Decidability of these
conditions is proven for regular languages. Finally, without additional
conditions, decidability of the question, whether a pair of regular languages
is closed under shuffle projection, is shown. In an appendix the relation
between shuffle projection and the shuffle product of two languages is
discussed. Additionally, a kind of shuffle product for computations in
S-automata is defined."
"There are languages A such that there is a Pushdown Automata (PDA) that
recognizes A which is much smaller than any Deterministic Pushdown Automata
(DPDA) that recognizes A. There are languages A such that there is a Linear
Bounded Automata (Linear Space Turing Machine, henceforth LBA) that recognizes
A which is much smaller than ny PDA that recognizes A. There are languages A
such that both A and compliment(A) are recognizable by a PDA, but the PDA for A
is much smaller than the PDA for compliment(A). There are languages A1, A2 such
that A1,A2,A1 INTERSECT A_2 are recognizable by a PDA, but the PDA for A1 and
A2 are much smaller than the PDA for A1 INTERSECT A2. We investigate these
phenomenon and show that, in all these cases, the size difference is captured
by a function whose Turing degree is on the second level of the arithmetic
hierarchy.
  Our theorems lead to infinitely-often results. For example: for infinitely
many $n$ there exists a language An recognized by a DPDA such that there is a
small PDA for An, but any DPDA for An is large. We look at cases where we can
get almost-all results, though with much smaller size differences."
"We prove a number of results on the structure and enumeration of palindromes
and antipalindromes. In particular, we study conjugates of palindromes,
palindromic pairs, rich words, and the counterparts of these notions for
antipalindromes."
"We show that equivalence of deterministic top-down tree-to-string transducers
is decidable, thus solving a long standing open problem in formal language
theory. We also present efficient algorithms for subclasses: polynomial time
for total transducers with unary output alphabet (over a given top-down regular
domain language), and co-randomized polynomial time for linear transducers;
these results are obtained using techniques from multi-linear algebra.
  For our main result, we prove that equivalence can be certified by means of
inductive invariants using polynomial ideals. This allows us to construct two
semi-algorithms, one searching for a proof of equivalence, one for a witness of
non-equivalence. Furthermore, we extend our result to deterministic top-down
tree-to-string transducers which produce output not in a free monoid but in a
free group."
"Cost register automata (CRA) were proposed by Alur et all as an alternative
model for weighted automata. In hope of finding decidable subclasses of CRA,
they proposed to restrict their model with the copyless restriction but nothing
is really know about the structure or properties of this new computational
model called copyless CRA.
  In this paper we study the properties and expressiveness of copyless CRA. We
propose a normal form for copyless CRA and we study the properties of a special
group of registers (called stable registers). Furthermore, we find that
copyless CRA do not have good closure properties since we show that they are
not closed under reverse operation. Finally, we propose a subclass of copyless
CRA and we show that this subclass is closed under regular-lookahead."
"Rational relations are binary relations of finite words that are realised by
non-deterministic finite state transducers (NFT). A particular kind of rational
relations is the sequential functions. Sequential functions are the functions
that can be realised by input-deterministic transducers. Some rational
functions are not sequential. However, based on a property on transducers
called the twinning property, it is decidable in PTime whether a rational
function given by an NFT is sequential. In this paper, we investigate the
generalisation of this result to multi-sequential relations, i.e. relations
that are equal to a finite union of sequential functions. We show that given an
NFT, it is decidable in PTime whether the relation it defines is
multi-sequential, based on a property called the weak twinning property. If the
weak twinning property is satisfied, we give a procedure that effectively
constructs a finite set of input-deterministic transducers whose union defines
the relation. This procedure generalises to arbitrary NFT the determinisation
procedure of functional NFT."
"The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over
finite words: given a probabilistic automaton, are there words accepted with
probability arbitrarily close to 1? This problem was proved undecidable
recently; to overcome this, several classes of probabilistic automata of
different nature were proposed, for which the value 1 problem has been shown
decidable. In this paper, we introduce yet another class of probabilistic
automata, called leaktight automata, which strictly subsumes all classes of
probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable. We prove
that for leaktight automata, the value 1 problem is decidable (in fact,
PSPACE-complete) by constructing a saturation algorithm based on the
computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton. We rely on
algebraic techniques developed by Simon to prove that this abstraction is
complete. Furthermore, we adapt this saturation algorithm to decide whether an
automaton is leaktight. Finally, we show a reduction allowing to extend our
decidability results from finite words to infinite ones, implying that the
value 1 problem for probabilistic leaktight parity automata is decidable."
"Interrupt Timed Automata (ITA) form a subclass of stopwatch automata where
reachability and some variants of timed model checking are decidable even in
presence of parameters. They are well suited to model and analyze real-time
operating systems. Here we extend ITA with polynomial guards and updates,
leading to the class of polynomial ITA (PolITA). We prove the decidability of
the reachability and model checking of a timed version of CTL by an adaptation
of the cylindrical decomposition method for the first-order theory of reals.
Compared to previous approaches, our procedure handles parameters and clocks in
a unified way. Moreover, we show that PolITA are incomparable with stopwatch
automata. Finally additional features are introduced while preserving
decidability."
"The FAdo system is a symbolic manipulator of formal languages objects,
implemented in Python. In this work, we extend its capabilities by implementing
methods to manipulate transducers and we go one level higher than existing
formal language systems and implement methods to manipulate objects
representing classes of independent languages (widely known as code
properties). Our methods allow users to define their own code properties and
combine them between themselves or with fixed properties such as prefix codes,
suffix codes, error detecting codes, etc. The satisfaction and maximality
decision questions are solvable for any of the definable properties. The new
online system LaSer allows to query about code properties and obtain the answer
in a batch mode. Our work is founded on independence theory as well as the
theory of rational relations and transducers and contributes with improveded
algorithms on these objects."
"We introduce homing vector automata, which are finite automata augmented by a
vector that is multiplied at each step by a matrix determined by the current
transition, and have to return the vector to its original setting in order to
accept the input. The computational power of the deterministic,
nondeterministic and blind versions of these real-time machines are examined
and compared to various related types of automata. A generalized version of the
Stern-Brocot encoding method, suitable for representing strings on arbitrary
alphabets, is also developed."
"We study various complexity properties of suffix-free regular languages. The
quotient complexity of a regular language $L$ is the number of left quotients
of $L$; this is the same as the state complexity of $L$. A regular language
$L'$ is a dialect of a regular language $L$ if it differs only slightly from
$L$. The quotient complexity of an operation on regular languages is the
maximal quotient complexity of the result of the operation expressed as a
function of the quotient complexities of the operands. A sequence
$(L_k,L_{k+1},\dots)$ of regular languages in some class ${\mathcal C}$, where
$n$ is the quotient complexity of $L_n$, is called a stream. A stream is most
complex in class ${\mathcal C}$ if its languages $L_n$ meet the complexity
upper bounds for all basic measures. It is known that there exist such most
complex streams in the class of regular languages, in the class of prefix-free
languages, and also in the classes of right, left, and two-sided ideals. In
contrast to this, we prove that there does not exist a most complex stream in
the class of suffix-free regular languages. However, we do exhibit one ternary
suffix-free stream that meets the bound for product and whose restrictions to
binary alphabets meet the bounds for star and boolean operations. We also
exhibit a quinary stream that meets the bounds for boolean operations,
reversal, size of syntactic semigroup, and atom complexities. Moreover, we
solve an open problem about the bound for the product of two languages of
quotient complexities $m$ and $n$ in the binary case by showing that it can be
met for infinitely many $m$ and $n$."
"Recently there has been a significant effort to handle quantitative
properties in formal verification and synthesis. While weighted automata over
finite and infinite words provide a natural and flexible framework to express
quantitative properties, perhaps surprisingly, some basic system properties
such as average response time cannot be expressed using weighted automata, nor
in any other know decidable formalism. In this work, we introduce nested
weighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes it
possible to express important quantitative properties such as average response
time. In nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collects
results from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along a
finite portion of an infinite word. Nested weighted automata can be viewed as
the quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-time
verification. We establish an almost complete decidability picture for the
basic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate their
applicability in several domains. In particular, nested weighted automata can
be used to decide average response time properties."
"Parametric timed automata extend the standard timed automata with the
possibility to use parameters in the clock guards. In general, if the
parameters are real-valued, the problem of language emptiness of such automata
is undecidable even for various restricted subclasses. We thus focus on the
case where parameters are assumed to be integer-valued, while the time still
remains continuous. On the one hand, we show that the problem remains
undecidable for parametric timed automata with three clocks and one parameter.
On the other hand, for the case with arbitrary many clocks where only one of
these clocks is compared with (an arbitrary number of) parameters, we show that
the parametric language emptiness is decidable. The undecidability result
tightens the bounds of a previous result which assumed six parameters, while
the decidability result extends the existing approaches that deal with
discrete-time semantics only. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
positive result in the case of continuous-time and unbounded integer
parameters, except for the rather simple case of single-clock automata."
"The edit distance between two words $w_1, w_2$ is the minimal number of word
operations (letter insertions, deletions, and substitutions) necessary to
transform $w_1$ to $w_2$. The edit distance generalizes to languages
$\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2$, where the edit distance from $\mathcal{L}_1$ to
$\mathcal{L}_2$ is the minimal number $k$ such that for every word from
$\mathcal{L}_1$ there exists a word in $\mathcal{L}_2$ with edit distance at
most $k$. We study the edit distance computation problem between pushdown
automata and their subclasses. The problem of computing edit distance to a
pushdown automaton is undecidable, and in practice, the interesting question is
to compute the edit distance from a pushdown automaton (the implementation, a
standard model for programs with recursion) to a regular language (the
specification). In this work, we present a complete picture of decidability and
complexity for the following problems: (1)~deciding whether, for a given
threshold $k$, the edit distance from a pushdown automaton to a finite
automaton is at most $k$, and (2)~deciding whether the edit distance from a
pushdown automaton to a finite automaton is finite."
"A regular language has the zero-one law if its asymptotic density converges
to either zero or one. We prove that the class of all zero-one languages is
closed under Boolean operations and quotients. Moreover, we prove that a
regular language has the zero-one law if and only if its syntactic monoid has a
zero element. Our proof gives both algebraic and automata characterisation of
the zero-one law for regular languages, and it leads the following two
corollaries: (i) There is an O(n log n) algorithm for testing whether a given
regular language has the zero-one law. (ii) The Boolean closure of existential
first-order logic over finite words has the zero-one law."
"We study finite automata running over infinite binary trees. A run of such an
automaton is usually said to be accepting if all its branches are accepting. In
this article, we relax the notion of accepting run by allowing a certain
quantity of rejecting branches.
  More precisely we study the following criteria for a run to be accepting: -
it contains at most finitely (resp countably) many rejecting branches; - it
contains infinitely (resp uncountably) many accepting branches; - the set of
accepting branches is topologically ""big"".
  In all situations we provide a simple acceptance game that later permits to
prove that the languages accepted by automata with cardinality constraints are
always $\omega$-regular. In the case (ii) where one counts accepting branches
it leads to new proofs (without appealing to logic) of an old result of
Beauquier and Niwinski."
"We answer an open question in the theory of degrees of infinite sequences
with respect to transducibility by finite-state transducers. An initial study
of this partial order of degrees was carried out in (Endrullis, Hendriks, Klop,
2011), but many basic questions remain unanswered. One of the central questions
concerns the existence of atom degrees, other than the degree of the `identity
sequence' 1 0^0 1 0^1 1 0^2 1 0^3 .... A degree is called an `atom' if below it
there is only the bottom degree 0, which consists of the ultimately periodic
sequences. We show that also the degree of the `squares sequence' 1 0^0 1 0^1 1
0^4 1 0^9 1 0^{16} ... is an atom. As the main tool for this result we
characterise the transducts of `spiralling' sequences and their degrees. We use
this to show that every transduct of a `polynomial sequence' either is in 0 or
can be transduced back to a polynomial sequence for a polynomial of the same
order."
"We present the first study of robustness of systems that are both timed as
well as reactive (I/O). We study the behavior of such timed I/O systems in the
presence of ""uncertain inputs"" and formalize their robustness using the
analytic notion of Lipschitz continuity. Thus, a timed I/O system is
K-(Lipschitz) robust if the perturbation in its output is at most K times the
perturbation in its input. We quantify input and output perturbation using
""similarity functions"" over timed words such as the timed version of the
Manhattan distance and the Skorokhod distance. We consider two models of timed
I/O systems --- timed transducers and asynchronous sequential circuits. While
K-robustness is undecidable even for discrete transducers, we identify a class
of timed transducers which admits a polynomial space decision procedure for
K-robustness. For asynchronous sequential circuits, we reduce K-robustness
w.r.t. timed Manhattan distances to K-robusness of discrete letter-to-letter
transducers and show PSPACE-compeleteness of the problem."
"For a given regular language of infinite trees, one can ask about the minimal
number of priorities needed to recognize this language with a
non-deterministic, alternating, or weak alternating parity automaton. These
questions are known as, respectively, the non-deterministic, alternating, and
weak Rabin-Mostowski index problems. Whether they can be answered effectively
is a long-standing open problem, solved so far only for languages recognizable
by deterministic automata (the alternating variant trivializes).
  We investigate a wider class of regular languages, recognizable by so-called
game automata, which can be seen as the closure of deterministic ones under
complementation and composition. Game automata are known to recognize languages
arbitrarily high in the alternating Rabin-Mostowski index hierarchy; that is,
the alternating index problem does not trivialize any more.
  Our main contribution is that all three index problems are decidable for
languages recognizable by game automata. Additionally, we show that it is
decidable whether a given regular language can be recognized by a game
automaton."
"We consider the problem of random uniform generation of traces (the elements
of a free partially commutative monoid) in light of the uniform measure on the
boundary at infinity of the associated monoid. We obtain a product
decomposition of the uniform measure at infinity if the trace monoid has
several irreducible components-a case where other notions such as Parry
measures, are not defined. Random generation algorithms are then examined."
"In this paper, we extend the notion of tree language quotients to bottom-up
quotients. Instead of computing the residual of a tree language from top to
bottom and producing a list of tree languages, we show how to compute a set of
k-ary trees, where k is an arbitrary integer. We define the quotient formula
for different combinations of tree languages: union, symbol products,
compositions, iterated symbol products and iterated composition. These
computations lead to the definition of the bottom-up quotient tree automaton,
that turns out to be the minimal deterministic tree automaton associated with a
regular tree language in the case of the 0-ary trees."
"The syntactic semigroup problem is to decide whether a given finite semigroup
is syntactic or not. This work investigates the syntactic semigroup problem for
both the semigroup reducts of $A^+(B_n)$, the affine near-semiring over a
Brandt semigroup $B_n$. It is ascertained that both the semigroup reducts of
$A^+(B_n)$ are syntactic semigroups."
"Context-free language theory is a well-established area of mathematics,
relevant to computer science foundations and technology. This paper presents
the preliminary results of an ongoing formalization project using context-free
grammars and the Coq proof assistant. The results obtained so far include the
representation of context-free grammars, the description of algorithms for some
operations on them (union, concatenation and closure) and the proof of related
theorems (e.g. the correctness of these algorithms). A brief survey of related
works is presented, as well as plans for further development."
"In this paper we define future-time branching temporal logics evaluated over
forests, that is, ordered tuples of ordered, but unranked, finite trees. We
associate a rich class FL[$\mathcal{L}$] of temporal logics to each set L of
(regular) modalities. Then, we define an algebraic product operation which we
call the Moore product, which operates on forest automata, algebraic devices
recognizing forest languages. We show a lattice isomorphism between the
pseudovarieties of finite forest automata, closed under the Moore product, and
the classes of languages of the form FL[$\mathcal{L}$]. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the algebraic approach by showing the decidability of the
membership problem of a specific pseudovariety of finite forest automata,
implying the decidability of the definability problem of the FL[EF] fragment of
the logic CTL. Then, using the same approach, we also formulate a conjecture
regarding a decidable characterization of the FL[AF] fragment which has
currently an unknown decidability status (also in the setting of ranked trees)."
"Regular string-to-string functions enjoy a nice triple characterization
through deterministic two-way transducers (2DFT), streaming string transducers
(SST) and MSO definable functions. This result has recently been lifted to FO
definable functions, with equivalent representations by means of aperiodic 2DFT
and aperiodic 1-bounded SST, extending a well-known result on regular
languages. In this paper, we give three direct transformations: i) from
1-bounded SST to 2DFT, ii) from 2DFT to copyless SST, and iii) from k-bounded
to 1-bounded SST. We give the complexity of each construction and also prove
that they preserve the aperiodicity of transducers. As corollaries, we obtain
that FO definable string-to-string functions are equivalent to SST whose
transition monoid is finite and aperiodic, and to aperiodic copyless SST."
"In this paper we propose a research programme for getting structural
characterisations for 2-dimensional languages generated by self-assembling
tiles. This is part of a larger programme on getting a formal foundation of
parallel, interactive, distributed systems."
"We address the problem of verifying timed properties of Markovian models of
large populations of interacting agents, modelled as finite state automata. In
particular, we focus on time-bounded properties of (random) individual agents
specified by Deterministic Timed Automata (DTA) endowed with a single clock.
Exploiting ideas from fluid approximation, we estimate the satisfaction
probability of the DTA properties by reducing it to the computation of the
transient probability of a subclass of Time-Inhomogeneous Markov Renewal
Processes with exponentially and deterministically-timed transitions, and a
small state space. For this subclass of models, we show how to derive a set of
Delay Differential Equations (DDE), whose numerical solution provides a fast
and accurate estimate of the satisfaction probability. In the paper, we also
prove the asymptotic convergence of the approach, and exemplify the method on a
simple epidemic spreading model. Finally, we also show how to construct a
system of DDEs to efficiently approximate the average number of agents that
satisfy the DTA specification."
"Weighted timed automata (WTA) model quantitative aspects of real-time systems
like continuous consumption of memory, power or financial resources. They
accept quantitative timed languages where every timed word is mapped to a
value, e.g., a real number. In this paper, we prove a Nivat theorem for WTA
which states that recognizable quantitative timed languages are exactly those
which can be obtained from recognizable boolean timed languages with the help
of several simple operations. We also introduce a weighted extension of
relative distance logic developed by Wilke, and we show that our weighted
relative distance logic and WTA are equally expressive. The proof of this
result can be derived from our Nivat theorem and Wilke's theorem for relative
distance logic. Since the proof of our Nivat theorem is constructive, the
translation process from logic to automata and vice versa is also constructive.
This leads to decidability results for weighted relative distance logic."
"In formal language theory, several different models characterize regular
languages, such as finite automata, congruences of finite index, or monadic
second-order logic (MSO). Moreover, several fragments of MSO have effective
characterizations based on algebraic properties. When we consider transducers
instead of automata, such characterizations are much more challenging, because
many of the properties of regular languages do not generalize to regular word
functions.
  In this paper we consider word functions that are definable by one-way
transducers (rational functions). We show that the canonical bimachine of
Reutenauer and Sch\""utzenberger preserves certain algebraic properties of
rational functions, similar to the case of word languages. In particular, we
give an effective characterization of functions that can be defined by an
aperiodic one-way transducer."
"We consider the embedding problem in coding theory: given an independence (a
code-related property) and an independent language $L$, find a maximal
independent language containing $L$. We consider the case where the
code-related property is defined via a rational binary relation that is
decreasing with respect to any fixed total order on the set of words. Our
method works by iterating a max-min operator that has been used before for the
embedding problem for properties defined by length-increasing-and-transitive
binary relations. By going to order-decreasing rational relations, represented
by input-decreasing transducers, we are able to include many known properties
from both the noiseless and noisy domains of coding theory, as well as any
combination of such properties. Moreover, in many cases the desired maximal
embedding is effectively computable."
"When a property needs to be checked against an unknown or very complex
system, classical exploration techniques like model-checking are not applicable
anymore. Sometimes a~monitor can be used, that checks a given property on the
underlying system at runtime. A monitor for a property $L$ is a deterministic
finite automaton $M_L$ that after each finite execution tells whether (1) every
possible extension of the execution is in $L$, or (2) every possible extension
is in the complement of $L$, or neither (1) nor (2) holds. Moreover, $L$ being
monitorable means that it is always possible that in some future the monitor
reaches (1) or (2). Classical examples for monitorable properties are safety
and cosafety properties. On the other hand, deterministic liveness properties
like ""infinitely many $a$'s"" are not monitorable. We discuss various monitor
constructions with a focus on deterministic omega-regular languages. We locate
a proper subclass of of deterministic omega-regular languages but also strictly
large than the subclass of languages which are deterministic and
codeterministic, and for this subclass there exists a canonical monitor which
also accepts the language itself.
  We also address the problem to decide monitorability in comparison with
deciding liveness. The state of the art is as follows. Given a B\""uchi
automaton, it is PSPACE-complete to decide liveness or monitorability. Given an
LTL formula, deciding liveness becomes EXPSPACE-complete, but the complexity to
decide monitorability remains open."
"We show the diagonal problem for higher-order pushdown automata (HOPDA), and
hence the simultaneous unboundedness problem, is decidable. From recent work by
Zetzsche this means that we can construct the downward closure of the set of
words accepted by a given HOPDA. This also means we can construct the downward
closure of the Parikh image of a HOPDA. Both of these consequences play an
important role in verifying concurrent higher-order programs expressed as HOPDA
or safe higher-order recursion schemes."
In the book we present main concepts of probabilistic automata theory.
"1-way quantum finite automata are deterministic and reversible in nature,
which greatly reduces its accepting property. In fact the set of languages
accepted by 1-way quantum finite automata is a proper subset of regular
languages. In this paper we replace the tape head of 1-way quantum finite
automata with DNA double strand and name the model Watson-Crick quantum finite
automata. The non-injective complementarity relation of Watson-Crick automata
introduces non-determinism in the quantum model. We show that this introduction
of non-determinism increases the computational power of 1-way Quantum finite
automata significantly. We establish that Watson-Crick quantum finite automata
can accept all regular languages and that it also accepts some languages not
accepted by any multihead deterministic finite automata. Exploiting the
superposition property of quantum finite automata we show that Watson-Crick
quantum finite automata accept the language L=ww where w belongs to {a,b}*."
"Watson-Crick automata are finite automata working on double strands.
Extensive research work has already been done on non-deterministic Watson-Crick
automata and on deterministic Watson-Crick automata. In this paper, we
introduce a new model of Watson-Crick automata which is reversible in nature
named reversible Watson-Crick automata and explore its computational power. We
show even though the model is reversible and one way it accepts all regular
languages and also analyze the state complexity of the above stated model with
respect to non-deterministic block automata and non-deterministic finite
automata and establish its superiority. We further explore the relation of the
reversible model with twin-shuffle language and recursively enumerable
languages."
"In this paper, we have introduced the deterministic variant of parallel
communicating Watson-Crick automata systems. We show that similar to the
non-deterministic version, the deterministic version can also recognise some
non-regular uniletter languages. We further establish that strongly
deterministic Watson-Crick automata systems and deterministic Watson-Crick
automata system are incomparable in terms of their computational ability. We
have also compared the computational ability of our system with multihead
finite automata and parallel communicating finite automata systems."
"We study pushdown vector addition systems, which are synchronized products of
pushdown automata with vector addition systems. The question of the boundedness
of the reachability set for this model can be refined into two decision
problems that ask if infinitely many counter values or stack configurations are
reachable, respectively.
  Counter boundedness seems to be the more intricate problem. We show
decidability in exponential time for one-dimensional systems. The proof is via
a small witness property derived from an analysis of derivation trees of
grammar-controlled vector addition systems."
"In this paper we prove several results on normal forms for linear
displacement context-free grammars. The results themselves are rather simple
and use well-known techniques, but they are extensively used in more complex
constructions. Therefore this article mostly serves educational and referential
purposes."
"We deal with $k$-out-regular directed multigraphs with loops (called simply
\emph{digraphs}). The edges of such a digraph can be colored by elements of
some fixed $k$-element set in such a way that outgoing edges of every vertex
have different colors. Such a coloring corresponds naturally to an automaton.
The road coloring theorem states that every primitive digraph has a
synchronizing coloring.
  In the present paper we study how many synchronizing colorings can exist for
a digraph with $n$ vertices. We performed an extensive experimental
investigation of digraphs with small number of vertices. This was done by using
our dedicated algorithm exhaustively enumerating all small digraphs. We also
present a series of digraphs whose fraction of synchronizing colorings is equal
to $1-1/k^d$, for every $d \ge 1$ and the number of vertices large enough.
  On the basis of our results we state several conjectures and open problems.
In particular, we conjecture that $1-1/k$ is the smallest possible fraction of
synchronizing colorings, except for a single exceptional example on 6 vertices
for $k=2$."
"Deterministic timed automata are strictly less expressive than their
non-deterministic counterparts, which are again less expressive than those with
silent transitions. As a consequence, timed automata are in general
non-determinizable. This is unfortunate since deterministic automata play a
major role in model-based testing, observability and implementability. However,
by bounding the length of the traces in the automaton, effective
determinization becomes possible. We propose a novel procedure for bounded
determinization of timed automata. The procedure unfolds the automata to
bounded trees, removes all silent transitions and determinizes via disjunction
of guards. The proposed algorithms are optimized to the bounded setting and
thus are more efficient and can handle a larger class of timed automata than
the general algorithms. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool and
evaluated on several examples. To our best knowledge, this is the first
implementation of this type of procedure for timed automata."
"In this note we present a characterisation of all unary and binary patterns
that do not only contain variables, but also reversals of their instances.
These types of variables were studied recently in either more general or
particular cases. We show that the results are not surprising at all in the
general case, and extend the avoidability of these patterns to enforce
aperiodic words."
"Let $\alpha,\beta$ be real numbers and $b\geq2$ be an integer. Allouche and
Shallit showed that the sequence $\{\lfloor\alpha n+\beta\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$ is
$b$-regular if and only if $\alpha$ is rational. In this paper, using a
base-independent regular language, we prove a similar result that the sequence
$\{\lfloor\log_b(\alpha n+\beta)\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$ is $b$-regular if and only
if $\alpha$ is rational. In particular, when $\alpha=\sqrt{2},\beta=0$ and
$b=2$, we answer the question of Allouche and Shallit that the sequence
$\{\lfloor\frac{1}{2}+\log_2n\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$ is not $2$-regular, which has
been proved by Bell, Moshe and Rowland respectively."
"Two words $w_1$ and $w_2$ are said to be $k$-binomial equivalent if every
non-empty word $x$ of length at most $k$ over the alphabet of $w_1$ and $w_2$
appears as a scattered factor of $w_1$ exactly as many times as it appears as a
scattered factor of $w_2$. We give two different polynomial-time algorithms
testing the $k$-binomial equivalence of two words. The first one is
deterministic (but the degree of the corresponding polynomial is too high) and
the second one is randomised (it is more direct and more efficient). These are
the first known algorithms for the problem which run in polynomial time."
"Following (Kolpakov et al., 2013; Gawrychowski and Manea, 2015), we continue
the study of {\em $\alpha$-gapped repeats} in strings, defined as factors $uvu$
with $|uv|\leq \alpha |u|$. Our main result is the $O(\alpha n)$ bound on the
number of {\em maximal} $\alpha$-gapped repeats in a string of length $n$,
previously proved to be $O(\alpha^2 n)$ in (Kolpakov et al., 2013). For a
closely related notion of maximal $\delta$-subrepetition (maximal factors of
exponent between $1+\delta$ and $2$), our result implies the $O(n/\delta)$
bound on their number, which improves the bound of (Kolpakov et al., 2010) by a
$\log n$ factor.
  We also prove an algorithmic time bound $O(\alpha n+S)$ ($S$ size of the
output) for computing all maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats. Our solution,
inspired by (Gawrychowski and Manea, 2015), is different from the recently
published proof by (Tanimura et al., 2015) of the same bound. Together with our
bound on $S$, this implies an $O(\alpha n)$-time algorithm for computing all
maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats."
"Context-free grammar simplification is a subject of high importance in
computer language processing technology as well as in formal language theory.
This paper presents a formalization, using the Coq proof assistant, of the fact
that general context-free grammars generate languages that can be also
generated by simpler and equivalent context-free grammars. Namely, useless
symbol elimination, inaccessible symbol elimination, unit rules elimination and
empty rules elimination operations were described and proven correct with
respect to the preservation of the language generated by the original grammar."
"Descriptional complexity is the study of the conciseness of the various
models representing formal languages. The state complexity of a regular
language is the size, measured by the number of states of the smallest, either
deterministic or nondeterministic, finite automaton that recognises it.
Operational state complexity is the study of the state complexity of operations
over languages. In this survey, we review the state complexities of individual
regularity preserving language operations on regular and some subregular
languages. Then we revisit the state complexities of the combination of
individual operations. We also review methods of estimation and approximation
of state complexity of more complex combined operations."
"The state complexity of a regular language is the number of states in a
minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting the language. The syntactic
complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup.
The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case
syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of
languages in that class. We prove that $n^{n-1}$, $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and
$n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$ are tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexities
of right ideals and prefix-closed languages, left ideals and suffix-closed
languages, and two-sided ideals and factor-closed languages, respectively.
Moreover, we show that the transition semigroups meeting the upper bounds for
all three types of ideals are unique, and the numbers of generators (4, 5, and
6, respectively) cannot be reduced."
"This is a reissue of the book Tree Automata by F. G\'ecseg and M. Steinby
originally published in 1984 by Akad\'emiai Kiad\'o, Budapest. Some mistakes
have been corrected and a few obscure passages have been clarified. Moreover,
some more recent contributions and current lines of research are reviewed in an
appendix that also contains several new references."
"We define a new subclass of nondeterministic finite automata for
prefix-closed languages called Flanked Finite Automata (FFA). We show that this
class enjoys good complexity properties while preserving the succinctness of
nondeterministic automata. In particular, we show that the universality problem
for FFA is in linear time and that language inclusion can be checked in
polynomial time. A useful application of FFA is to provide an efficient way to
compute the quotient and inclusion of regular languages without the need to use
the powerset construction. These operations are the building blocks of several
verification algorithms."
"Extensions to finite-state automata on strings, such as multi-head automata
or multi-counter automata, have been successfully used to encode many
infinite-state non-regular verification problems. In this paper, we consider a
generalization of automata-theoretic infinite-state verification from strings
to labeled series-parallel graphs. We define a model of non-deterministic,
2-way, concurrent automata working on series-parallel graphs and communicating
through shared registers on the nodes of the graph. We consider the following
verification problem: given a family of series-parallel graphs described by a
context-free graph transformation system (GTS), and a concurrent automaton over
series-parallel graphs, is some graph generated by the GTS accepted by the
automaton? The general problem is undecidable already for (one-way) multi-head
automata over strings. We show that a bounded version, where the automata make
a fixed number of reversals along the graph and use a fixed number of shared
registers is decidable, even though there is no bound on the sizes of
series-parallel graphs generated by the GTS. Our decidability result is based
on establishing that the number of context switches is bounded and on an
encoding of the computation of bounded concurrent automata to reduce the
emptiness problem to the emptiness problem for pushdown automata."
"An automaton $\bf A$ is called a retractable automaton if, for every
subautomaton $\bf B$ of $\bf A$, there is at least one homomorphism of $\bf A$
onto $\bf B$ which leaves the elements of $B$ fixed (such homomorphism is
called a retract homomorphism of $\bf A$ onto $\bf B$). We say that a
retractable automaton ${\bf A}$=(A,X,$\delta$) is Boolean-type if there exists
a family $\{\lambda_B \mid \textrm{ B is a subautomaton of A } \}$ of retract
homomorphisms $\lambda _B$ of $\bf A$ such that, for arbitrary subautomata
${\bf B}_1$ and ${\bf B}_2$ of $\bf A$, the condition $B_1\subseteq B_2$
implies $Ker\lambda _{B_2}\subseteq Ker\lambda _{B_1}$. In this paper we
describe the Boolean-type retractable state-finite automata without outputs."
"A homomorphism of an automaton ${\bf A}$ without outputs onto a subautomaton
${\bf B}$ of ${\bf A}$ is called a retract homomorphism if it leaves the
elements of $B$ fixed. An automaton ${\bf A}$ is called a retractable automaton
if, for every subautomaton ${\bf B}$ of ${\bf A}$, there is a retract
homomorphism of ${\bf A}$ onto ${\bf B}$. In [1] and [3], special retractable
automata are examined. The purpose of this paper is to give a complete
description of state-finite retractable automata without outputs."
"We consider the problem of computing the probability of regular languages of
infinite trees with respect to the natural coin-flipping measure. We propose an
algorithm which computes the probability of languages recognizable by
\emph{game automata}. In particular this algorithm is applicable to all
deterministic automata. We then use the algorithm to prove through examples
three properties of measure: (1) there exist regular sets having irrational
probability, (2) there exist comeager regular sets having probability $0$ and
(3) the probability of \emph{game languages} $W_{i,k}$, from automata theory,
is $0$ if $k$ is odd and is $1$ otherwise."

languages and finite state tree transformations."
"In 2006, Czeizler et.al. introduced parallel communicating Watson-Crick
automata system. They showed that parallel communicating Watson-Crick automata
system can accept the non-regular unary language L={a^(n^2 ),where n>1} using
non-injective complementarity relation and three components. In this paper, we
improve on Czeizler et.al. work by showing that parallel communicating
Watson-Crick automata system can accept the same language L using just two
components."
"We propose to study value automata with filters, a natural generalization of
regular cost automata to nondeterminism. Models such as weighted automata and
Parikh automata appear naturally as specializations. Results on the
expressiveness of this model offer a general understanding of the behavior of
the models that arise as special cases. A landscape of such restrictions is
drawn."
"We introduce a new notion of a relational word as a finite totally ordered
set of positions endowed with three binary relations that describe which
positions are labeled by equal data, by unequal data and those having an
undefined relation between their labels. We define the operations of insertion
and deletion on relational words generalizing corresponding operations on
strings. We prove that the transitive and reflexive closure of these operations
has a decidable membership problem for the case of short insertion-deletion
rules (of size two/three and three/two). At the same time, we show that in the
general case such systems can produce a coding of any recursively enumerable
language leading to undecidabilty of reachability questions."
"We define a new class of pushdown systems where the pushdown is a tree
instead of a word. We allow a limited form of lookahead on the pushdown
conforming to a certain ordering restriction, and we show that the resulting
class enjoys a decidable reachability problem. This follows from a preservation
of recognizability result for the backward reachability relation of such
systems. As an application, we show that our simple model can encode several
formalisms generalizing pushdown systems, such as ordered multi-pushdown
systems, annotated higher-order pushdown systems, the Krivine machine, and
ordered annotated multi-pushdown systems. In each case, our procedure yields
tight complexity."
"In this paper we consider pushdown graphs, i.e. infinite graphs that can be
described as transition graphs of deterministic real-time pushdown automata. We
consider the case where some vertices are designated as being final and we
built, in a breadth-first manner, a marking of edges that lead to such vertices
(i.e., for every vertex that can reach a final one, we mark all out-going edges
laying on some shortest path to a final vertex).
  Our main result is that the edge-marked version of a pushdown graph may
itself no longer be a pushdown graph, as we prove that this enrich graph may
have an undecidable MSO theory.

"Inspired by multi-head finite automata and Watson-Crick automata in this
paper, we introduce new structure namely multi-head Watson-Crick automata where
we replace the single tape of multi-head finite automaton by a DNA double
strand. The content of the second tape is determined using a complementarity
relation similar to Watson-Crick complementarity relation. We establish the
superiority of our model over multi-head finite automata and also show that
both the deterministic and non-deterministic variant of the model can accept
non-regular unary languages. We also compare our model with parallel
communicating Watson-Crick automata systems and prove that both of them have
the same computational power."
"Context-free languages (CFLs) are highly important in computer language
processing technology as well as in formal language theory. The Pumping Lemma
is a property that is valid for all context-free languages, and is used to show
the existence of non context-free languages. This paper presents a
formalization, using the Coq proof assistant, of the Pumping Lemma for
context-free languages."
"We prove that the class of linear context-free tree languages is not closed
under inverse linear tree homomorphisms. The proof is by contradiction: we
encode Dyck words into a context-free tree language and prove that its preimage
under a certain linear tree homomorphism cannot be generated by any
context-free tree grammar. A positive result can still be obtained: the linear
monadic context-free tree languages are closed under inverse linear tree
homomorphisms."
"We study varieties that contain unranked tree languages over all alphabets.
Trees are labeled with symbols from two alphabets, an unranked operator
alphabet and an alphabet used for leaves only. Syntactic algebras of unranked
tree languages are defined similarly as for ranked tree languages, and an
unranked tree language is shown to be recognizable iff its syntactic algebra is
regular, i.e., a finite unranked algebra in which the operations are defined by
regular languages over its set of elements. We establish a bijective
correspondence between varieties of unranked tree languages and varieties of
regular algebras. For this, we develop a basic theory of unranked algebras in
which algebras over all operator alphabets are considered together. Finally, we
show that the natural unranked counterparts of several general varieties of
ranked tree languages form varieties in our sense.
  This work parallels closely the theory of general varieties of ranked tree
languages and general varieties of finite algebras, but many nontrivial
modifications are required. For example, principal varieties as the basic
building blocks of varieties of tree languages have to be replaced by what we
call quasi-principal varieties, and we device a general scheme for defining
these by certain systems of congruences."
"Context-free language theory is a subject of high importance in computer
language processing technology as well as in formal language theory. This paper
presents a formalization, using the Coq proof assistant, of fundamental results
related to context-free grammars and languages. These include closure
properties (union, concatenation and Kleene star), grammar simplification
(elimination of useless symbols inaccessible symbols, empty rules and unit
rules) and the existence of a Chomsky Normal Form for context-free grammars."
"A right ideal (left ideal, two-sided ideal) is a non-empty language $L$ over
an alphabet $\Sigma$ such that $L=L\Sigma^*$ ($L=\Sigma^*L$,
$L=\Sigma^*L\Sigma^*$). Let $k=3$ for right ideals, 4 for left ideals and 5 for
two-sided ideals. We show that there exist sequences ($L_n \mid n \ge k $) of
right, left, and two-sided regular ideals, where $L_n$ has quotient complexity
(state complexity) $n$, such that $L_n$ is most complex in its class under the
following measures of complexity: the size of the syntactic semigroup, the
quotient complexities of the left quotients of $L_n$, the number of atoms
(intersections of complemented and uncomplemented left quotients), the quotient
complexities of the atoms, and the quotient complexities of reversal, star,
product (concatenation), and all binary boolean operations. In that sense,
these ideals are ""most complex"" languages in their classes, or ""universal
witnesses"" to the complexity of the various operations."
"Context free languages allow one to express data with hierarchical structure,
at the cost of losing some of the useful properties of languages recognized by
finite automata on words. However, it is possible to restore some of these
properties by making the structure of the tree visible, such as is done by
visibly pushdown languages, or finite automata on trees. In this paper, we show
that the structure given by such approaches remains invisible when it is read
by a finite automaton (on word). In particular, we show that separability with
a regular language is undecidable for visibly pushdown languages, just as it is
undecidable for general context free languages."
"Unstructured data have to be parsed in order to become usable. The complexity
of grammar notations and the difficulty of grammar debugging limit the use of
parsers for data preprocessing. We introduce a notation in which grammars are
defined by simply dividing terminals into predefined classes and then splitting
elements of some classes into multiple layered sub-groups. These LL(1) grammars
are designed for data languages. They simplify the task of developing data
parsers."
"Determinisation is an important concept in the theory of finite tree
automata. However the complexity of the textbook procedure for determinisation
is such that it is not viewed as a being a practical procedure for manipulating
tree automata, even fairly small ones. The computational problems are
exacerbated when an automaton has to be both determinised and completed, for
instance to compute the complement of an automaton. In this paper we develop an
algorithm for determinisation and completion of finite tree automata, whose
worst-case complexity remains unchanged, but which performs dramatically better
than existing algorithms in practice. The algorithm is developed in stages by
optimising the textbook algorithm. A critical aspect of the algorithm is that
the transitions of the determinised automaton are generated in a potentially
very compact form called product form, which can often be used directly when
manipulating the determinised automaton. The paper contains an experimental
evaluation of the algorithm on a large set of tree automata examples.
Applications of the algorithm include static analysis of term rewriting systems
and logic programs, and checking containment of languages defined by tree
automata such as XML schemata."
"We study the computational complexity of reachability, coverability and
inclusion for extensions of context-free commutative grammars with integer
counters and reset operations on them. Those grammars can alternatively be
viewed as an extension of communication-free Petri nets. Our main results are
that reachability and coverability are inter-reducible and both NP-complete. In
particular, this class of commutative grammars enjoys semi-linear reachability
sets. We also show that the inclusion problem is, in general, coNEXP-complete
and already $\Pi_2^\text{P}$-complete for grammars with only one non-terminal
symbol. Showing the lower bound for the latter result requires us to develop a
novel $\Pi_2^\text{P}$-complete variant of the classic subset sum problem."
"B\""uchi automaton of records (BAR) has been proposed as a basic operational
semantics for Reo coordination language. It is an extension of B\""uchi
automaton by using a set of records as its alphabet or transition labels.
Records are used to express the synchrony between the externally visible
actions of coordinated components modeled by BARs. The main composition
operator on the set of BARs is called as join which is the semantics of its
counterpart in Reo. In this paper, we define the notion of labeled transition
systems of records as a generalization of the notion of BAR, abstracting away
from acceptance or rejection of strings. Then, we consider four equivalence
relations (semantics) over the set of labeled transition systems of records and
investigate their congruency with respect to the join composition operator. In
fact, we prove that the finite-traces-based, infinite-traces-based, and
nondeterministic finite automata (NFA)-based equivalence relations all are
congruence relations over the set of all labeled transition systems of records
with respect to the join operation. However, the equivalence relation using
B\""uchi acceptance condition is not so. In addition, using these results, we
introduce the language-theoretic definitions of the join operation considering
both finite and infinite strings notions. Also, we show that there is no
language-based and structure-independent definition of the join operation on
B\""uchi automata of records."
"Usually, a parser for an $LR(k)$-grammar $G$ is a deterministic pushdown
transducer which produces backwards the unique rightmost derivation for a given
input string $x \in L(G)$. The best known upper bound for the size of such a
parser is $O(2^{|G||\Sigma|^k+k\log |\Sigma| + \log |G|})$ where $|G|$ and
$|\Sigma|$ are the sizes of the grammar $G$ and the terminal alphabet $\Sigma$,
respectively. If we add to a parser the possibility to manipulate a directed
graph of size $O(|G|n)$ where $n$ is the length of the input then we obtain an
extended parser. The graph is used for an efficient parallel simulation of all
potential leftmost derivations of the current right sentential form such that
the unique rightmost derivation of the input can be computed. Given an
arbitrary $LR(k)$-grammar $G$, we show how to construct an extended parser of
$O(|G| + \#LA |N|2^k k \log k)$ size where $|N|$ is the number of nonterminal
symbols and $\#LA$ is the number of relevant lookaheads with respect to the
grammar $G$. As the usual parser, this extended parser uses only tables as data
structure. Using some ingenious data structures and increasing the parsing time
by a small constant factor, the size of the extended parser can be reduced to
$O(|G| + \#LA|N|k^2)$. The parsing time is $O(ld(input) + k|G|n)$ where
$ld(input)$ is the length of the derivation of the input. Moreover, we have
constructed a one pass parser."
"We complete the initial study of jumping finite automata, which was started
in a former article of Meduna and Zemek \citep{athMED1}. The open questions
about basic closure properties are solved. Besides this, we correct erroneous
results presented in the article. Finally, we point out important relations
between jumping finite automata and some other models studied in the
literature."
"First, we show that universality and other properties of general jumping
finite automata are undecidable, which answers a question asked by Meduna and
Zemek in 2012. Second, we close the study raised by \v{C}erno and Mr\'{a}z in
2010 by proving that clearing restarting automata using contexts of size two
can accept binary non-context-free languages."
"We investigate the expressive power of quantifier alternation hierarchy of
first-order logic over words. This hierarchy includes the classes ${\Sigma}_i$
(sentences having at most $i$ blocks of quantifiers starting with an $\exists$)
and $\mathcal{B}{\Sigma}_i$ (Boolean combinations of ${\Sigma}_i$ sentences).
So far, this expressive power has been effectively characterized for the lower
levels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made over finite words, and decidable
characterizations were obtained for $\mathcal{B}{\Sigma}_2$ and ${\Sigma}_3$,
by relying on a decision problem called separation, and solving it for
${\Sigma}_2$. The contribution of this paper is a generalization of these
results to the setting of infinite words: we solve separation for ${\Sigma}_2$
and ${\Sigma}_3$, and obtain decidable characterizations of
$\mathcal{B}{\Sigma}_2$ and ${\Sigma}_3$ as consequences."
"A coloring of a digraph with a fixed out-degree k is a distribution of k
labels over the edges resulting in a deterministic finite automaton. An
automaton is called synchronizing if there exists a word which sends all states
of the automaton to a single state. In the present paper we study connections
between spectral and synchronizing properties of digraphs. We show that if a
coloring of a digraph is not synchronizing, then the stationary distribution of
an associated Markov chain has a partition of coordinates into blocks of equal
sum. Moreover, if there exists such a partition, then there exists a
non-synchronizing automaton with such stationary distribution. We extend these
results to bound the number of non-synchronizing colorings for digraphs with
particular eigenvectors. We also demonstrate that the length of the shortest
synchronizing word of any coloring is at most $w^2 - 3w + 3$, where $w$ is the
sum of the coordinates of the integer principal eigenvector of the digraph."
"The article continues the study of the genus of regular languages that the
authors introduced in a 2012 paper. Generalizing a previous result, we produce
a new family of regular languages on a two-letter alphabet having arbitrary
high genus. Let $L$ be a regular language. In order to understand the genus
$g(L)$ of $L$, we introduce the topological size of $|L|_{\rm{top}}$ to be the
minimal size of all finite deterministic automata of genus $g(L)$ computing
$L$. We show that the minimal finite deterministic automaton of a regular
language can be arbitrary far away from a finite deterministic automaton
realizing the minimal genus and computing the same language, both in terms of
the difference of genera and in terms of the difference in size. In particular,
we show that the topological size $|L|_{\rm{top}}$ can grow at least
exponentially in size $|L|$. We conjecture however the genus of every regular
language to be computable. This conjecture implies in particular that the
planarity of a regular language is decidable, a question asked in 1976 by R.V.
Book and A.K. Chandra. We prove here the conjecture for a fairly generic class
of regular languages having no short cycles."
"Dipole words are sequences of magnetic dipoles, in which alike elements repel
and opposite elements attract. Magnetic dipoles contrast with more general sets
of bonding types, called glues, in which pairwise bonding strength is specified
by a glue function. We prove that every glue function $g$ has a set of dipole
words, called a dipole code, that attractively encodes $g$: the pairwise
attractions (positive or non-positive bond strength) between the words are
identical to those of $g$. Moreover, we give such word sets of asymptotically
optimal length. Similar results are obtained for a commonly used subclass of
glue functions."
"We investigate the shuffle operation on regular languages represented by
complete deterministic finite automata. We prove that $f(m,n)=2^{mn-1} +
2^{(m-1)(n-1)}(2^{m-1}-1)(2^{n-1}-1)$ is an upper bound on the state complexity
of the shuffle of two regular languages having state complexities $m$ and $n$,
respectively. We also state partial results about the tightness of this bound.
We show that there exist witness languages meeting the bound if $2\le m\le 5$
and $n\ge2$, and also if $m=n=6$. Moreover, we prove that in the subset
automaton of the NFA accepting the shuffle, all $2^{mn}$ states can be
distinguishable, and an alphabet of size three suffices for that. It follows
that the bound can be met if all $f(m,n)$ states are reachable. We know that an
alphabet of size at least $mn$ is required provided that $m,n \ge 2$. The
question of reachability, and hence also of the tightness of the bound $f(m,n)$
in general, remains open."
"Hankel matrices (aka connection matrices) of word functions and graph
parameters have wide applications in automata theory, graph theory, and machine
learning. We give a characterization of real-valued functions on nested words
recognized by weighted visibly pushdown automata in terms of Hankel matrices on
nested words. This complements C. Mathissen's characterization in terms of
weighted monadic second order logic."
"In this paper we address the problem of the uniform random generation of non
deterministic automata (NFA) up to isomorphism. First, we show how to use a
Monte-Carlo approach to uniformly sample a NFA. Secondly, we show how to use
the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to uniformly generate NFAs up to isomorphism.
Using labeling techniques, we show that in practice it is possible to move into
the modified Markov Chain efficiently, allowing the random generation of NFAs
up to isomorphism with dozens of states. This general approach is also applied
to several interesting subclasses of NFAs (up to isomorphism), such as NFAs
having a unique initial states and a bounded output degree. Finally, we prove
that for these interesting subclasses of NFAs, moving into the Metropolis
Markov chain can be done in polynomial time. Promising experimental results
constitute a practical contribution."
"Probabilistic automata were introduced by Rabin in 1963 as language
acceptors. Two automata are equivalent if and only if they accept each word
with the same probability. On the other side, in the process algebra community,
probabilistic automata were re-proposed by Segala in 1995 which are more
general than Rabin's automata. Bisimulations have been proposed for Segala's
automata to characterize the equivalence between them. So far the two notions
of equivalences and their characteristics have been studied mostly
independently. In this paper, we consider Segala's automata, and propose a
novel notion of distribution-based bisimulation by joining the existing
equivalence and bisimilarities. We demonstrate the utility of our definition by
studying distribution-based bisimulation metrics, which gives rise to a robust
notion of equivalence for Rabin's automata. We compare our notions of
bisimulation to some existing distribution-based bisimulations and discuss
their compositionality and relations to trace equivalence. Finally, we show the
decidability and complexity of all relations."
"A regular language is $k$-lookahead deterministic (resp. $k$-block
deterministic) if it is specified by a $k$-lookahead deterministic (resp.
$k$-block deterministic) regular expression. These two subclasses of regular
languages have been respectively introduced by Han and Wood ($k$-lookahead
determinism) and by Giammarresi et al. ($k$-block determinism) as a possible
extension of one-unambiguous languages defined and characterized by
Br\""uggemann-Klein and Wood. In this paper, we study the hierarchy and the
inclusion links of these families. We first show that each $k$-block
deterministic language is the alphabetic image of some one-unambiguous
language. Moreover, we show that the conversion from a minimal DFA of a
$k$-block deterministic regular language to a $k$-block deterministic automaton
not only requires state elimination, and that the proof given by Han and Wood
of a proper hierarchy in $k$-block deterministic languages based on this result
is erroneous. Despite these results, we show by giving a parameterized family
that there is a proper hierarchy in $k$-block deterministic regular languages.
We also prove that there is a proper hierarchy in $k$-lookahead deterministic
regular languages by studying particular properties of unary regular
expressions. Finally, using our valid results, we confirm that the family of
$k$-block deterministic regular languages is strictly included into the one of
$k$-lookahead deterministic regular languages by showing that any $k$-block
deterministic unary language is one-unambiguous."
"This papers presents a general framework for the uniform random generation of
deterministic real-time accessible pushdown automata. A polynomial time
algorithm to randomly generate a pushdown automaton having a fixed stack
operations total size is proposed. The influence of the accepting condition
(empty stack, final state) on the reachability of the generated automata is
investigated."
"This paper introduces methods for describing properties of possibly very
large state machines in terms of solutions to recursive functions and applies
those methods to computer systems."
"Given a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ and a deterministic finite automaton on
$\Sigma$, the problem of determining whether the language recognized by the
automaton contains any pangram is \NP-complete. Various other language classes
and problems around pangrams are analyzed."
"We present an efficient algorithm to reduce the size of nondeterministic tree
automata, while retaining their language. It is based on new transition pruning
techniques, and quotienting of the state space w.r.t. suitable equivalences. It
uses criteria based on combinations of downward and upward simulation preorder
on trees, and the more general downward and upward language inclusions. Since
tree-language inclusion is EXPTIME-complete, we describe methods to compute
good approximations in polynomial time. We implemented our algorithm as a
module of the well-known libvata tree automata library, and tested its
performance on a given collection of tree automata from various applications of
libvata in regular model checking and shape analysis, as well as on various
classes of randomly generated tree automata. Our algorithm yields substantially
smaller and sparser automata than all previously known reduction techniques,
and it is still fast enough to handle large instances."
"We introduce a normal form for context-free grammars, called Dyck normal
form. This is a syntactical restriction of the Chomsky normal form, in which
the two nonterminals occurring on the right-hand side of a rule are paired
nonterminals. This pairwise property allows to define a homomorphism from Dyck
words to words generated by a grammar in Dyck normal form. We prove that for
each context-free language L, there exist an integer K and a homomorphism h
such that L=h(D'_K), where D'_K is a subset of the one-sided Dyck language over
K letters. Through a transition-like diagram for a context-free grammar in Dyck
normal form, we effectively build a regular language R that satisfies the
Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem. Using graphical approaches we refine R such
that the Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem still holds. Based on this readjustment
we sketch a transition diagram for a regular grammar that generates a regular
superset approximation for the initial context-free language."
"A data tree is an unranked ordered tree where each node carries a label from
a finite alphabet and a datum from some infinite domain. We consider the two
variable first order logic FO2(<,+1,~) over data trees. Here +1 refers to the
child and the next sibling relations while < refers to the descendant and
following sibling relations. Moreover, ~ is a binary predicate testing data
equality. We exhibit an automata model, denoted DAD# that is more expressive
than FO2(<,+1,~) but such that emptiness of DAD# and satisfiability of
FO2(<,+1,~) are inter-reducible. This is proved via a model of counter tree
automata, denoted EBVASS, that extends Branching Vector Addition Systems with
States (BVASS) with extra features for merging counters. We show that, as
decision problems, reachability for EBVASS, satisfiability of FO2(<,+1,~) and
emptiness of DAD# are equivalent."
"I study the state complexity of binary operations on regular languages over
different alphabets. It is well known that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are languages
restricted to be over the same alphabet, with $m$ and $n$ quotients,
respectively, the state complexity of any binary boolean operation on $L'_m$
and $L_n$ is $mn$, and that of the product (concatenation) is $(m-1)2^n
+2^{n-1}$. In contrast to this, I show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over their
own different alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference
is $mn+m+n+1$, that of intersection is $mn$, that of difference is $mn+m$, and
that of the product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$."
"The busy beaver is a well-known specific example of a non-computable
function. Whilst many aspect of this problem have been investigated, it is not
always easy to find thorough and convincing evidence for the claims made about
the maximality of particular machines, and the phenomenal size of some of the
numbers involved means that it is not obvious that the problem can be feasibly
addressed at all. In this paper we address both of these issues. We discuss a
framework in which the busy beaver problem and similar problems may be
addressed, and the appropriate processes for providing evidence of claims made.
We also show how a simple heuristic, which we call the observant otter, can be
used to evaluate machines with an extremely large number of execution steps
required to terminate. We also show empirical results for an implementation of
this heuristic which show how this heuristic is effective for all known
`monster' machines."
"In this paper, we introduce a new model of deterministic Watson-Crick
automaton namely restricted deterministic Watson- Crick automaton which is a
deterministic Watson-Crick automaton where the complementarity string in the
lower strand is restricted to a language L. We examine the computational power
of the restricted model with respect to L being in different language classes
such as regular, unary regular, finite, context free and context sensitive. We
also show that computational power of restricted deterministic Watson- Crick
automata with L in regular languages is same as that of deterministic
Watson-Crick automata and that the set of all languages accepted by restricted
deterministic Watson-Crick automata with L in unary regular languages is a
proper subset of context free languages."
"This note corrects a technical error in the ACM Computing Surveys paper
mentioned in the title. The flaw involved constructions for showing that timed
automata with urgent locations have the same expressiveness as timed automata
that allow false location invariants. Corrected con- structions are presented
in this note, and the affected results are reproved."
"Transductions are binary relations of finite words. For rational
transductions, i.e., transductions defined by finite transducers, the
inclusion, equivalence and sequential uniformisation problems are known to be
undecidable. In this paper, we investigate stronger variants of inclusion,
equivalence and sequential uniformisation, based on a general notion of
transducer resynchronisation, and show their decidability. We also investigate
the classes of finite-valued rational transductions and deterministic rational
transductions, which are known to have a decidable equivalence problem. We show
that sequential uniformisation is also decidable for them."
"Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers,
that are both of modulus~$\geq \sqrt 5$. We prove that there exist a $X\subset
\mathbb Z[i]$ which is $a$-automatic but not $b$-automatic. This settles a
problem of Allouche, Cateland, Gilbert, Peitgen, Shallit, and Skordev."
"In this paper we continue a classical work of Sch\""utzenberger on codes with
bounded synchronization delay. He was interested to characterize those regular
languages where the groups in the syntactic monoid belong to a variety $H$. He
allowed operations on the language side which are union, intersection,
concatenation and modified Kleene-star involving a mapping of a prefix code of
bounded synchronization delay to a group $G\in H$, but no complementation. In
our notation this leads to the language classes $SD_G(A^\infty)$ and
$SD_H(A^\infty$). Our main result shows that $SD_H(A^\infty)$ always
corresponds to the languages having syntactic monoids where all subgroups are
in $H$. Sch\""utzenberger showed this for a variety $H$ if $H$ contains Abelian
groups, only. Our method shows the general result for all $H$ directly on
finite and infinite words. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of local Rees
products which refers to a simple type of classical Rees extensions. We give a
decomposition of a monoid in terms of its groups and local Rees products. This
gives a somewhat similar, but simpler decomposition than in Rhodes' synthesis
theorem. Moreover, we need a singly exponential number of operations, only.
Finally, our decomposition yields an answer to a question in a recent paper of
Almeida and Kl\'ima about varieties that are closed under Rees products."
"A regular language is $k$-piecewise testable if it is a finite boolean
combination of languages of the form $\Sigma^* a_1 \Sigma^* \cdots \Sigma^* a_n
\Sigma^*$, where $a_i\in\Sigma$ and $0\le n \le k$. Given a DFA $A$ and $k\ge
0$, it is an NL-complete problem to decide whether the language $L(A)$ is
piecewise testable and, for $k\ge 4$, it is coNP-complete to decide whether the
language $L(A)$ is $k$-piecewise testable. It is known that the depth of the
minimal DFA serves as an upper bound on $k$. Namely, if $L(A)$ is piecewise
testable, then it is $k$-piecewise testable for $k$ equal to the depth of $A$.
In this paper, we show that some form of nondeterminism does not violate this
upper bound result. Specifically, we define a class of NFAs, called ptNFAs,
that recognize piecewise testable languages and show that the depth of a ptNFA
provides an (up to exponentially better) upper bound on $k$ than the minimal
DFA. We provide an application of our result, discuss the relationship between
$k$-piecewise testability and the depth of NFAs, and study the complexity of
$k$-piecewise testability for ptNFAs."
"We present a general framework to define an application-dependent weight
measure on terms that subsumes e.g. total simplification orderings, and an O(n
log n) algorithm for the simultaneous computation of the minimal weight of a
term in the language of each nonterminal of a regular tree grammar, based on
Barzdins' liquid-flow technique."
"We solve a problem of Petrova, finalizing the classification of letter
patterns avoidable by ternary square-free words; we show that there is a
ternary square-free word avoiding letter pattern $xyzxzyx$. In fact, we: (1)
characterize all the (two-way) infinite ternary square-free words avoiding
letter pattern $xyzxzyx$ (2) characterize the lexicographically least (one-way)
infinite ternary square-free word avoiding letter pattern $xyzxzyx$ (3) show
that the number of ternary square-free words of length $n$ avoiding letter
pattern $xyzxzyx$ grows exponentially with $n$."
"We give a new version of fuzzy alternating $\mathrm{B\ddot{u}chi}$ automata
over distributive lattices: weights are putting in every leaf node of run trees
rather than along with edges from every node to its children. Such settings are
great benefit to obtain complement just by taking dual operation and replacing
each final weight with its complement. We prove that $L$-fuzzy nondeterministic
$\mathrm{B\ddot{u}chi}$ automata have the same expressive power as $L$-fuzzy
alternating $\mathrm{B\ddot{u}chi}$ ones. A direct construction (without
related knowledge about $L$-fuzzy nondeterministic $\mathrm{B\ddot{u}chi}$ ones
such as: above equivalence relation and their closure properties) is given to
show that the languages recognized by $L$-fuzzy alternating
co-$\mathrm{B\ddot{u}chi}$ automata are also $L$-fuzzy $\omega$-regular.
Furthermore, the closure properties and the discussion about decision problems
for fuzzy alternating $\mathrm{B\ddot{u}chi}$ automata are illustrated in our
paper."
"Weakly recognizing morphisms from free semigroups onto finite semigroups are
a classical way for defining the class of omega-regular languages, i.e., a set
of infinite words is weakly recognizable by such a morphism if and only if it
is accepted by some B\""uchi automaton. We consider the descriptional complexity
of various constructions for weakly recognizing morphisms. This includes the
conversion from and to B\""uchi automata, the conversion into strongly
recognizing morphisms, and complementation. For some problems, we are able to
give more precise bounds in the case of binary alphabets or simple semigroups."
"We prove that a trace monoid embeds into the queue monoid if and only if it
embeds into the direct product of two free monoids. We also give a decidable
characterization of these trace monoids."
"We introduce homing vector automata, which are finite automata augmented by a
vector that is multiplied at each step by a matrix determined by the current
transition, and have to return the vector to its original setting in order to
accept the input. The computational power and properties of deterministic,
nondeterministic, blind, non-blind, real-time and one-way versions of these
machines are examined and compared to various related types of automata. A
generalized version of the Stern-Brocot encoding method, suitable for
representing strings on arbitrary alphabets, is also developed."
"Higher-order grammars are extensions of regular and context-free grammars,
where non-terminals may take parameters. They have been extensively studied in
1980's, and restudied recently in the context of model checking and program
verification. We show that the class of unsafe order-(n+1) word languages
coincides with the class of frontier languages of unsafe order-n tree
languages. We use intersection types for transforming an order-(n+1) word
grammar to a corresponding order-n tree grammar. The result has been proved for
safe languages by Damm in 1982, but it has been open for unsafe languages, to
our knowledge. Various known results on higher-order grammars can be obtained
as almost immediate corollaries of our result."
"Codes with various kinds of decipherability, weaker than the usual unique
decipherability, have been studied since multiset decipherability was
introduced in mid-1980s. We consider decipherability of directed figure codes,
where directed figures are defined as labelled polyominoes with designated
start and end points, equipped with catenation operation that may use a merging
function to resolve possible conflicts. This is one of possible extensions
generalizing words and variable-length codes to planar structures. Here,
verification whether a given set is a code is no longer decidable in general.
We study the decidability status of figure codes depending on catenation type
(with or without a merging function), decipherability kind (unique, multiset,
set or numeric) and code geometry (several classes determined by relative
positions of start and end points of figures). We give decidability or
undecidability proofs in all but two cases that remain open."
"We present an infinite series of $n$-state Eulerian automata whose reset
words have length at least $(n^2-3)/2$. This improves the current lower bound
on the length of shortest reset words in Eulerian automata. We conjecture that
$(n^2-3)/2$ also forms an upper bound for this class and we experimentally
verify it for small automata by an exhaustive computation."
"A theorem of Eilenberg establishes that there exists a bijection between the
set of all varieties of regular languages and the set of all varieties of
finite monoids. In this article after defining, for a fixed set of sorts $S$
and a fixed $S$-sorted signature $\Sigma$, the concepts of formation of
congruences with respect to $\Sigma$ and of formation of $\Sigma$-algebras, we
prove that the algebraic lattices of all $\Sigma$-congruence formations and of
all $\Sigma$-algebra formations are isomorphic, which is an Eilenberg's type
theorem. Moreover, under a suitable condition on the free $\Sigma$-algebras and
after defining the concepts of formation of congruences of finite index with
respect to $\Sigma$, of formation of finite $\Sigma$-algebras, and of formation
of regular languages with respect to $\Sigma$, we prove that the algebraic
lattices of all $\Sigma$-finite index congruence formations, of all
$\Sigma$-finite algebra formations, and of all $\Sigma$-regular language
formations are isomorphic, which is also an Eilenberg's type theorem."
"For a language $L$, we consider its cyclic closure, and more generally the
language $C^k(L)$, which consists of all words obtained by partitioning words
from $L$ into $k$ factors and permuting them. We prove that the classes of ET0L
and EDT0L languages are closed under the operators $C^k$. This both sharpens
and generalises Brandst\""adt's result that if $L$ is context-free then $C^k(L)$
is context-sensitive and not context-free in general for $k\geq 3$. We also
show that the cyclic closure of an indexed language is indexed."
"This paper studies the number conservation property of 1-dimensional
non-uniform cellular automata (CAs). In a non-uniform cellular automaton (CA),
different cells may follow different rules. The present work considers that the
cells follow Wolfram's CAs rules. A characterization tool, named Reachability
tree is used to discover the number conservation property of non-uniform CAs.
Then a decision algorithm is reported to conclude whether a given non-uniform
CA with $n$ cells is number conserving or not. Finally, a synthesis scheme is
developed to get an $n$-cell number conserving non-uniform CA."
"Regular expressions are often ambiguous. We present a novel method based on
Brzozowski's derivatives to aid the user in diagnosing ambiguous regular
expressions. We introduce a derivative-based finite state transducer to
generate parse trees and minimal counter-examples. The transducer can be easily
customized to either follow the POSIX or Greedy disambiguation policy and based
on a finite set of examples it is possible to examine if there are any
differences among POSIX and Greedy."
"Automata with monitor counters, where the transitions do not depend on
counter values, and nested weighted automata are two expressive
automata-theoretic frameworks for quantitative properties. For a well-studied
and wide class of quantitative functions, we establish that automata with
monitor counters and nested weighted automata are equivalent. We study for the
first time such quantitative automata under probabilistic semantics. We show
that several problems that are undecidable for the classical questions of
emptiness and universality become decidable under the probabilistic semantics.
We present a complete picture of decidability for such automata, and even an
almost-complete picture of computational complexity, for the probabilistic
questions we consider."
"We study the properties of syntactic monoids of bifix-free regular languages.
In particular, we solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We
prove that the cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a bifix-free language
with state complexity $n$ is at most $(n-1)^{n-3}+(n-2)^{n-3}+(n-3)2^{n-3}$ for
$n\ge 6$. The main proof uses a large construction with the method of injective
function. Since this bound is known to be reachable, and the values for $n \le
5$ are known, this completely settles the problem. We also prove that
$(n-2)^{n-3} + (n-3)2^{n-3} - 1$ is the minimal size of the alphabet required
to meet the bound for $n \ge 6$. Finally, we show that the largest transition
semigroups of minimal DFAs which recognize bifix-free languages are unique up
to renaming the states."
"We characterize the complexity of the PATS problem for patterns of fixed
height and color count in variants of the model where seed glues are either
chosen or fixed and identical (so-called non-uniform and uniform variants). We
prove that both variants are NP-complete for patterns of height 2 or more and
admit O(n)-time algorithms for patterns of height 1. We also prove that if the
height and number of colors in the pattern is fixed, the non-uniform variant
admits a O(n)-time algorithm while the uniform variant remains NP-complete. The
NP-completeness results use a new reduction from a constrained version of a
problem on finite state transducers."
"We investigate the question of computational resources (such as stacks and
counters) necessary to perform radix conversions. To this end it is shown that
no PDA can compute the significand of the best $n$-digit floating point
approximation of a power of an incommensurable radix. This extends the results
of W.~Clinger. We also prove that a two counter machine with input is capable
of such conversions. On the other hand we note a curious asymmetry with respect
to the order in which the digits are input by showing that a two counter
machine can decode its input online if the digits are presented in the
most-to-least significant order while no such machine can decode its input in
this manner if the digits are presented in the least-to-most significant order.
Some structural results about two counter machines (with input) are also
established."
"We introduce a general class of distances (metrics) between Markov chains,
which are based on linear behaviour. This class encompasses distances given
topologically (such as the total variation distance or trace distance) as well
as by temporal logics or automata. We investigate which of the distances can be
approximated by observing the systems, i.e. by black-box testing or simulation,
and we provide both negative and positive results."
"Regular languages are closed under a wealth of formal language operators.
Incorporating such operators in regular expressions leads to concise language
specifications, but the transformation of such enhanced regular expressions to
finite automata becomes more involved.
  We present an approach that enables the direct construction of finite
automata from regular expressions enhanced with further operators that preserve
regularity. Our construction is based on an extension of the theory of
derivatives for regular expressions. To retain the standard results about
derivatives, we develop a derivability criterion for the compatibility of the
extra operators with derivatives.
  Some derivable operators do not preserve regularity. Derivatives provide a
decision procedure for the word problem of regular expressions enhanced with
such operators."
"MapReduce is a popular programming model for data parallel computation. In
MapReduce, the reducer produces an output from a list of inputs. Due to the
scheduling policy of the platform, the inputs may arrive at the reducers in
different order. The commutativity problem of reducers asks if the output of a
reducer is independent of the order of its inputs. Although the problem is
undecidable in general, the MapReduce programs in practice are usually used for
data analytics and thus require very simple control flow. By exploiting the
simplicity, we propose a programming language for reducers where the
commutativity problem is decidable. The main idea of the reducer language is to
separate the control and data flow of programs and disallow arithmetic
operations in the control flow. The decision procedure for the commutativity
problem is obtained through a reduction to the equivalence problem of streaming
numerical transducers (SNTs), a novel automata model over infinite alphabets
introduced in this paper. The design of SNTs is inspired by streaming
transducers (Alur and Cerny, POPL 2011). Nevertheless, the two models are
intrinsically different since the outputs of SNTs are integers while those of
streaming transducers are data words. The decidability of the equivalence of
SNTs is achieved with an involved combinatorial analysis of the evolvement of
the values of the integer variables during the runs of SNTs."
"We present an algorithm to build an automaton from a rational expression.
This approach introduces support for extended weighted expressions. Inspired by
derived-term based algorithms, its core relies on a different construct,
rational expansions. We introduce an inductive algorithm to compute the
expansion of an expression from which the automaton follows. This algorithm is
independent of the size of the alphabet, and actually even supports infinite
alphabets. It can easily be accommodated to generate deterministic (weighted)
automata. These constructs are implemented in Vcsn, a free-software platform
dedicated to weighted automata and rational expressions."
"The Sch\""utzenberger product of monoids is a key tool for the algebraic
treatment of language concatenation. In this paper we generalize the
Sch\""utzenberger product to the level of monoids in an algebraic category
$\mathscr{D}$, leading to a uniform view of the corresponding constructions for
monoids (Sch\""utzenberger), ordered monoids (Pin), idempotent semirings
(Kl\'ima and Pol\'ak) and algebras over a field (Reutenauer). In addition,
assuming that $\mathscr{D}$ is part of a Stone-type duality, we derive a
characterization of the languages recognized by Sch\""utzenberger products."
"The downward closure of a language is the set of all (not necessarily
contiguous) subwords of its members. It is well-known that the downward closure
of every language is regular. Moreover, recent results show that downward
closures are computable for quite powerful system models.
  One advantage of abstracting a language by its downward closure is that then
equivalence and inclusion become decidable. In this work, we study the
complexity of these two problems. More precisely, we consider the following
decision problems: Given languages $K$ and $L$ from classes $\mathcal{C}$ and
$\mathcal{D}$, respectively, does the downward closure of $K$ include (equal)
that of $L$?
  These problems are investigated for finite automata, one-counter automata,
context-free grammars, and reversal-bounded counter automata. For each
combination, we prove a completeness result either for fixed or for arbitrary
alphabets. Moreover, for Petri net languages, we show that both problems are
Ackermann-hard and for higher-order pushdown automata of order~$k$, we prove
hardness for complements of nondeterministic $k$-fold exponential time."
"The function $sep(w,x)$ is defined as the size of the smallest deterministic
finite automaton that accepts $w$ and rejects $x$. It has remained unsolved
until now that whether the difference $|sep(w,x) - sep(w^R, x^R)|$ is bounded
or not. In this paper, we prove by construction that this difference is
unbounded."
"A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is prefix-convex if, for any words
$x,y,z\in\Sigma^*$, whenever $x$ and $xyz$ are in $L$, then so is $xy$.
Prefix-convex languages include right-ideal, prefix-closed, and prefix-free
languages. We study complexity properties of prefix-convex regular languages.
In particular, we find the quotient/state complexity of boolean operations,
product (concatenation), star, and reversal, the size of the syntactic
semigroup, and the quotient complexity of atoms. For binary operations we use
arguments with different alphabets when appropriate; this leads to higher tight
upper bounds than those obtained with equal alphabets. We exhibit most complex
prefix-convex languages that meet the complexity bounds for all the measures
listed above."
"This paper develops a free energy theory from physics including the
variational principles for automata and languages and also provides algorithms
to compute the energy as well as efficient algorithms for estimating the
nondeterminism in a nondeterministic finite automaton. This theory is then used
as a foundation to define a semantic similarity metric for automata and
languages. Since automata are a fundamental model for all modern programs while
languages are a fundamental model for the programs' behaviors, we believe that
the theory and the metric developed in this paper can be further used for
real-word programs as well."
"The non-overlapping sets of pictures are sets such that no two pictures in
the set (properly) overlap. They are the generalization to two dimensions of
the cross-bifix-free sets of strings. Non-overlapping sets of pictures are
non-expandable when no other picture can be added without violating the
property. We present a construction of non-expandable non-overlapping (NENO)
sets of pictures and show some examples of application."
"Automata-logic connections are pillars of the theory of regular languages.
Such connections are harder to obtain for transducers, but important results
have been obtained recently for word-to-word transformations, showing that the
three following models are equivalent: deterministic two-way transducers,
monadic second-order (MSO) transducers, and deterministic one-way automata
equipped with a finite number of registers. Nested words are words with a
nesting structure, allowing to model unranked trees as their depth-first-search
linearisations. In this paper, we consider transformations from nested words to
words, allowing in particular to produce unranked trees if output words have a
nesting structure. The model of visibly pushdown transducers allows to describe
such transformations, and we propose a simple deterministic extension of this
model with two-way moves that has the following properties: i) it is a simple
computational model, that naturally has a good evaluation complexity; ii) it is
expressive: it subsumes nested word-to-word MSO transducers, and the exact
expressiveness of MSO transducers is recovered using a simple syntactic
restriction; iii) it has good algorithmic/closure properties: the model is
closed under composition with a unambiguous one-way letter-to-letter transducer
which gives closure under regular look-around, and has a decidable equivalence
problem."
"The complexity and decidability of various decision problems involving the
shuffle operation are studied. The following three problems are all shown to be
$NP$-complete: given a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) $M$, and two
words $u$ and $v$, is $L(M)$ not a subset of $u$ shuffled with $v$, is $u$
shuffled with $v$ not a subset of $L(M)$, and is $L(M)$ not equal to $u$
shuffled with $v$? It is also shown that there is a polynomial-time algorithm
to determine, for $NFA$s $M_1, M_2$ and a deterministic pushdown automaton
$M_3$, whether $L(M_1)$ shuffled with $L(M_2)$ is a subset of $L(M_3)$. The
same is true when $M_1, M_2,M_3$ are one-way nondeterministic
$l$-reversal-bounded $k$-counter machines, with $M_3$ being deterministic.
Other decidability and complexity results are presented for testing whether
given languages $L_1, L_2$ and $R$ from various languages families satisfy
$L_1$ shuffled with $L_2$ is a subset of $R$, and $R$ is a subset of $L_1$
shuffled with $L_2$. Several closure results on shuffle are also shown."
"Context-free games are two-player rewriting games that are played on nested
strings representing XML documents with embedded function symbols. These games
were introduced to model rewriting processes for intensional documents in the
Active XML framework, where input documents are to be rewritten into a given
target schema by calls to external services.
  This paper studies the setting where dependencies between inputs and outputs
of service calls are modelled by transducers, which has not been examined
previously. It defines transducer models operating on nested words and studies
their properties, as well as the computational complexity of the winning
problem for transducer-based context-free games in several scenarios. While the
complexity of this problem is quite high in most settings (ranging from
NP-complete to undecidable), some tractable restrictions are also identified."
"We introduce tree stack automata as a new class of automata with storage and
identify a restricted form of tree stack automata that recognises exactly the
multiple context-free languages."
"Several years ago Th\'erien and Wilke exhibited a decidable characterization
of the languages of words that are definable in FO2(<,+1). Their proof relies
on three separate ingredients. The first one is the characterization of the
languages that are definable in FO2(<) as those whose syntactic semigroup
belongs to the variety DA. Then, this result is combined with a wreath product
argument showing that being definable in FO2(<,+1) corresponds to having a
syntactic semigroup in DA*D. Finally, proving that membership of a semigroup in
DA*D is decidable requires a third ingredient: the ""locality"" of DA, a result
proved by Almeida. In this note we present a new self-contained and simple
proof that definability in FO2(<,+1) is decidable. We obtain the locality of DA
as a corollary."
"We show that the equivalence of deterministic linear top-down tree-to-word
transducers is decidable in polynomial time. Linear tree-to-word transducers
are non-copying but not necessarily order-preserving and can be used to express
XML and other document transformations. The result is based on a partial normal
form that provides a basic characterization of the languages produced by linear
tree-to-word transducers."
"We prove a Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger representation theorem for multiple
context-free languages weighted over complete commutative strong bimonoids."
"The timed pattern matching problem is formulated by Ulus et al. and has been
actively studied since, with its evident application in monitoring real-time
systems. The problem takes as input a timed word/signal and a timed pattern
(specified either by a timed regular expression or by a timed automaton); and
it returns the set of those intervals for which the given timed word, when
restricted to the interval, matches the given pattern. We contribute a
Boyer-Moore type optimization in timed pattern matching, relying on the classic
Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm and its extension to (untimed) pattern
matching by Watson and Watson. We assess its effect through experiments; for
some problem instances our Boyer-Moore type optimization achieves speed-up by
two times, indicating its potential in real-world monitoring tasks where data
sets tend to be massive."
"We present a few results and several open problems concerning complete
deterministic finite automata in which every non-empty subset of the state set
occurs as the image of the whole state set under the action of a suitable input
word."
"1-way quantum finite state automata are reversible in nature, which greatly
reduces its accepting property. In fact, the set of languages accepted by 1-way
quantum finite automata is a proper subset of regular languages. We introduce
2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton (2T1QFA(2))which is a modified
version of 1-way 2-head quantum finite state automaton(1QFA(2)). In this paper,
we replace the single tape of 1-way 2-head quantum finite state automaton with
two tapes. The content of the second tape is determined using a relation
defined on input alphabet. The main claims of this paper are as follows: (1)We
establish that 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) can
accept all regular languages (2)A language which cannot be accepted by any
multi-head deterministic finite automaton can be accepted by 2-tape 1-way
quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) .(3) Exploiting the superposition
property of quantum automata we show that 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state
automaton(2T1QFA(2)) can accept the language L=ww."
"Many different deletion operations are investigated applied to languages
accepted by one-way and two-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter
machines, deterministic pushdown automata, and finite automata. Operations
studied include the prefix, suffix, infix and outfix operations, as well as
left and right quotient with languages from different families. It is often
expected that language families defined from deterministic machines will not be
closed under deletion operations. However, here, it is shown that one-way
deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages are closed under right
quotient with languages from many different language families; even those
defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages. Also,
it is shown that when starting with one-way deterministic machines with one
counter that makes only one reversal, taking the left quotient with languages
from many different language families -- again including those defined by
nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages -- yields only
one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages (by increasing
the number of counters). However, if there are two more reversals on the
counter, or a second 1-reversal-bounded counter, taking the left quotient (or
even just the suffix operation) yields languages that can neither be accepted
by deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines, nor by 2-way
nondeterministic machines with one reversal-bounded counter."
"We investigate the number of nested string replacements required to reduce a
string of identical characters to one character."
"We have improved an algorithm generating synchronizing automata with a large
length of the shortest reset words. This has been done by refining some known
results concerning bounds on the reset length. Our improvements make possible
to consider a number of conjectures and open questions concerning synchronizing
automata, checking them for automata with a small number of states and
discussing the results. In particular, we have verified the \v{C}ern\'y
conjecture for all binary automata with at most 12 states, and all ternary
automata with at most 8 states."
"We improve some results relative to the state complexity of the multiple
catenation described by Gao and Yu. In particular we nearly divide by 2 the
size of the alphabet needed for witnesses. We also give some refinements to the
algebraic expression of the state complexity, which is especially complex with
this operation. We obtain these results by using peculiar DFAs defined by
Brzozowski."
"We present an Angluin-style algorithm to learn nominal automata, which are
acceptors of languages over infinite (structured) alphabets. The abstract
approach we take allows us to seamlessly extend known variations of the
algorithm to this new setting. In particular we can learn a subclass of nominal
non-deterministic automata. An implementation using a recently developed
Haskell library for nominal computation is provided for preliminary
experiments."
"We introduce (weighted) rational expressions to denote series over Cartesian
products of monoids. To this end, we propose the operator $|$ to build
multitape expressions such as $(a^+|x + b^+|y)^*$. We define expansions, which
generalize the concept of derivative of a rational expression, but relieved
from the need of a free monoid. We propose an algorithm based on expansions to
build multitape automata from multitape expressions."
"We present a few classes of synchronizing automata exhibiting certain
extremal properties with regard to synchronization. The first is a series of
automata with subsets whose shortest extending words are of length
$\varTheta(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of states of the automaton. This
disproves a conjecture that every subset in a strongly connected synchronizing
automaton is $cn$-extendable, for some constant $c$, and in particular, shows
that the cubic upper bound on the length of the shortest reset words cannot be
improved generally by means of the extension method. A detailed analysis shows
that the automata in the series have subsets that require words as long as
$n^2/4+O(n)$ in order to be extended by at least one element.
  We also discuss possible relaxations of the conjecture, and propose the
image-extension conjecture, which would lead to a quadratic upper bound on the
length of the shortest reset words. In this regard we present another class of
automata, which turn out to be counterexamples to a key claim in a recent
attempt to improve the Pin-Frankl bound for reset words.
  Finally, we present two new series of slowly irreducibly synchronizing
automata over a ternary alphabet, whose lengths of the shortest reset words are
$n^2-3n+3$ and $n^2-3n+2$, respectively. These are the first examples of such
series of automata for alphabets of size larger than two."
"We consider the problem of finding an optimal statistical model for a given
binary string. Following Kolmogorov, we use structure functions. In order to
get concrete results, we replace Turing machines by finite automata and
Kolmogorov complexity by Shallit and Wang's automatic complexity.
  The $p$-value of a model for given data $x$ is the probability that there
exists a model with as few states, accepting as few words, fitting uniformly
randomly selected data $y$.
  Deterministic and nondeterministic automata can give different optimal
models. For $x=011\, 110\, 110\, 11$, the best deterministic model has
$p$-value $0.3$, whereas the best nondeterministic model has $p$-value $0.04$.
  In the nondeterministic case, counting paths and counting words can give
different optimal models. For $x=01100\, 01000$, the best path-counting model
has $p$-value $0.79$, whereas the best word-counting model has $p$-value
$0.60$."
"We characterize the finite sets S of words such that that the iterated
shuffle of S is co-finite and we give some bounds on the length of a longest
word not in the iterated shuffle of S."
"We consider the language consisting of all words such that it is possible to
obtain the empty word by iteratively deleting powers. It turns out that in the
case of deleting squares in binary words this language is regular, and in the
case of deleting squares in words over a larger alphabet the language is not
regular. However, for deleting squares over any alphabet we find that this
language can be generated by a linear index grammar which is a mildly context
sensitive grammar formalism. In the general case we show that this language is
generated by an indexed grammar."
"Given two families of sets $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$, the $\mathcal{F}$
separability problem for $\mathcal{G}$ asks whether for two given sets $U, V
\in \mathcal{G}$ there exists a set $S \in \mathcal{F}$, such that $U$ is
included in $S$ and $V$ is disjoint with $S$. We consider two families of sets
$\mathcal{F}$: modular sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}^d$, defined as unions of
equivalence classes modulo some natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and unary
sets. Our main result is decidability of modular and unary separability for the
class $\mathcal{G}$ of reachability sets of Vector Addition Systems, Petri
Nets, Vector Addition Systems with States, and for sections thereof."
"We investigate the language classes recognized by group automata over matrix
groups. We present a summary of the results obtained so far together with a
number of new results. We look at the computational power of time-bounded group
automata where the group under consideration has polynomial growth."
"Software development is an iterative process which includes a set of
development steps that transform the initial high level specification of the
system into its final, fully specified, implementation. This report discusses
the theoretical foundations that allow Incomplete B\""uchi Automata (IBAs) to be
used in the iterative development of a sequential system."
"This paper gives a concise introduction into the basic theory of
{\omega}-automata (as of March 2014). The starting point are the different
types of recurrence conditions, modes of operation (deterministic,
nondeterministic, alternating automata), and directions (forward or backward
automata). The main focus is on fundamental automata constructions, for
instance, for boolean operations, determinization, disambiguation, and removing
alternation. It also covers some algebraic aspects such as congruences for
{\omega}-automata (and {\omega}-languages), basic structure theory (loops), and
applications in mathematical logic. This paper may eventually become a chapter
in a handbook of automata theory."
"Partially ordered nondeterminsitic finite automata (poNFAs) are NFAs whose
transition relation induces a partial order on states, that is, for which
cycles occur only in the form of self-loops on a single state. A poNFA is
universal if it accepts all words over its input alphabet. Deciding
universality is PSPACE-complete for poNFAs, and we show that this remains true
even when restricting to a fixed alphabet. This is nontrivial since standard
encodings of alphabet symbols in, e.g., binary can turn self-loops into longer
cycles. A lower coNP-complete complexity bound can be obtained if we require
that all self-loops in the poNFA are deterministic, in the sense that the
symbol read in the loop cannot occur in any other transition from that state.
We find that such restricted poNFAs (rpoNFAs) characterise the class of
$\mathcal{R}$-trivial languages, and we establish the complexity of deciding if
the language of an NFA is $\mathcal{R}$-trivial. Nevertheless, the limitation
to fixed alphabets turns out to be essential even in the restricted case:
deciding universality of rpoNFAs with unbounded alphabets is PSPACE-complete.
Based on a close relation between universality and the problems of inclusion
and equivalence, we also obtain the complexity results for these two problems.
Finaly, we show that the languages of rpoNFAs are definable by deterministic
(one-unambiguous) regular expressions, which makes them interesting in schema
languages for XML data."
"We study the state complexity of binary operations on regular languages over
different alphabets. It is known that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are languages of
state complexities $m$ and $n$, respectively, and restricted to the same
alphabet, the state complexity of any binary boolean operation on $L'_m$ and
$L_n$ is $mn$, and that of product (concatenation) is $m 2^n - 2^{n-1}$. In
contrast to this, we show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over different
alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference is
$(m+1)(n+1)$, that of difference is $mn+m$, that of intersection is $mn$, and
that of product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$. We also study unrestricted complexity of
binary operations in the classes of regular right, left, and two-sided ideals,
and derive tight upper bounds. The bounds for product of the unrestricted cases
(with the bounds for the restricted cases in parentheses) are as follows: right
ideals $m+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1}$ ($m+2^{n-2}$); left ideals $mn+m+n$ ($m+n-1$);
two-sided ideals $m+2n$ ($m+n-1$). The state complexities of boolean operations
on all three types of ideals are the same as those of arbitrary regular
languages, whereas that is not the case if the alphabets of the arguments are
the same. Finally, we update the known results about most complex regular,
right-ideal, left-ideal, and two-sided-ideal languages to include the
unrestricted cases."
"A polyomino is said to be L-convex if any two of its cells are connected by a
4-connected inner path that changes direction at most once. The 2-dimensional
language representing such polyominoes has been recently proved to be
recognizable by tiling systems by S. Brocchi, A. Frosini, R. Pinzani and S.
Rinaldi. In an attempt to compare recognition power of tiling systems and
cellular automata, we have proved that this language can be recognized by
2-dimensional cellular automata working on the von Neumann neighborhood in real
time.
  Although the construction uses a characterization of L-convex polyominoes
that is similar to the one used for tiling systems, the real time constraint
which has no equivalent in terms of tilings requires the use of techniques that
are specific to cellular automata."
"We study the influence of the dimension of cellular automata (CA) for real
time language recognition of one-dimensional languages with parallel input.
Specifically, we focus on the question of determining whether every language
that can be recognized in real time on a 2-dimensional CA working on the Moore
neighborhood can also be recognized in real time by a 1-dimensional CA working
on the standard two-way neighborhood.
  We show that 2-dimensional CA in real time can perform a linear number of
simulations of a 1-dimensional real time CA. If the two classes are equal then
the number of simulated instances can be polynomial."
"A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is suffix-convex if, for any words
$x,y,z\in\Sigma^*$, whenever $z$ and $xyz$ are in $L$, then so is $yz$.
Suffix-convex languages include three special cases: left-ideal, suffix-closed,
and suffix-free languages. We examine complexity properties of these three
special classes of suffix-convex regular languages. In particular, we study the
quotient/state complexity of boolean operations, product (concatenation), star,
and reversal on these languages, as well as the size of their syntactic
semigroups, and the quotient complexity of their atoms."
"It is well known that the emptiness problem for binary probabilistic automata
and so for quantum automata is undecidable. We present the current status of
the emptiness problems for unary probabilistic and quantum automata with
connections with Skolem's and positivity problems. We also introduce the
concept of linear recurrence automata in order to show the connection
naturally. Then, we also give possible generalizations of linear recurrence
relations and automata on vectors."
"We introduce Symbolic Alternating Finite Automata (s-AFA) as an expressive,
succinct, and decidable model for describing sets of finite sequences over
arbitrary alphabets. Boolean operations over s-AFAs have linear complexity,
which is in sharp contrast with the quadratic cost of intersection and union
for non-alternating symbolic automata. Due to this succinctness, emptiness and
equivalence checking are PSpace-hard.
  We introduce an algorithm for checking the equivalence of two s-AFAs based on
bisimulation up to congruence. This algorithm allows us to exploit the power of
SAT and SMT solvers to efficiently search the state space of the s-AFAs. We
evaluate our decision procedure on two verification and security applications:
1) checking satisfiability of linear temporal logic formulas over finite
traces, and 2) checking equivalence of Boolean combinations of regular
expressions. Our experiments show that our technique often outperforms existing
techniques and it can be beneficial in both such applications."
"The busy beaver problem is a well-known example of a non-computable function.
In order to determine a particular value of this function, it is necessary to
generate and classify a large number of Turing machines. Previous work on this
problem has described the processes used for the generation and classification
of these machines, but unfortunately has generally not provided details of the
machines considered. While there is no reason to doubt the veracity of the
results known so far, it is difficult to accept such results as scientifically
proven without being able to inspect the appropriate evidence. In addition, a
list of machines and their classifications can be used for other results, such
as variations on the busy beaver problem and related problems such as the
placid platypus problem. In this paper we investigate how to generate classes
of machines to be considered for the busy beaver problem. We discuss the
relationship between quadruple and quintuple variants of Turing machines, and
show that the latter are more general than the former. We give some formal
results to justify our strategy for minimising the number of machines
generated, and define a process reflecting this strategy for generating
machines. We describe our implementation, and the results of generating various
classes of machines with up to 5 states or up to 5 symbols, all of which
(together with our code) are available on the author's website."
"In this paper, we prove that a class of regular sequences can be viewed as
projections of fixed points of uniform morphisms on a countable alphabet, and
also can be generated by countable states automata. Moreover, we prove that the
regularity of some regular sequences is invariant under some codings."
"This work considers weak deterministic B\""uchi automata reading encodings of
non-negative reals in a fixed base. A Real Number Automaton is an automaton
which recognizes all encoding of elements of a set of reals. It is explained
how to decide in linear time whether a set of reals recognized by a given
minimal weak deterministic RNA is ${FO}[\mathbb R;+,<,1]$-definable.
Furthermore, it is explained how to compute in quasi-quadratic (respectively,
quasi-linear) time an existential (respectively, existential-universal)
${FO}[\mathbb R;+,<,1]$-formula which defines the set of reals recognized by
the automaton. It is also shown that techniques given by Muchnik and by Honkala
for automata over vector of natural numbers also works on vector of real
numbers. It implies that some problems such as deciding whether a set of tuples
of reals $R\subseteq\mathbb R^{d}$ is a subsemigroup of $(\mathbb R^{d},+)$ or
is ${FO}[\mathbb R;+,<,1]$-definable is decidable."
"The family, L(INDLIN), of languages generated by linear indexed grammars has
been studied in the literature. It is known that the Parikh image of every
language in L(INDLIN) is semi-linear. However, there are bounded semi linear
languages that are not in L(INDLIN). Here, we look at larger families of
(restricted) indexed languages and study their properties, their relationships,
and their decidability properties."
"We extend Antimirov's partial derivatives from regular expressions to
$\mu$-regular expressions that describe context-free languages. We prove the
correctness of partial derivatives as well as the finiteness of the set of
iterated partial derivatives. The latter are used as pushdown symbols in our
construction of a nondeterministic pushdown automaton, which generalizes
Antimirov's NFA construction."
"In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to learn a B\""uchi automaton from
a teacher who knows an $\omega$-regular language. The algorithm is based on
learning a formalism named family of DFAs (FDFAs) recently proposed by Angluin
and Fisman[10]. The main catch is that we use a classification tree structure
instead of the standard observation table structure. The worst case storage
space required by our algorithm is quadratically better than the table-based
algorithm proposed in [10]. We implement the first publicly available library
ROLL (Regular Omega Language Learning ), which consists of all $\omega$-regular
learning algorithms available in the literature and the new algorithms proposed
in this paper. Experimental results show that our tree-based algorithms have
the best performance among others regarding the number of solved learning
tasks."
"In this paper, we prove the semidecidability of the problem of saying whether
or not a context-free grammar generates a regular language. We introduce the
notion of context-free grammar in Marciani Normal Form. We prove that a
context-free grammar in Marciani Normal Form always generates a regular
language."
"We adapt Tomita's Generalized LR algorithm to languages generated by
context-free grammars enriched with a shuffle operator. The change involves
extensions to the underlying handle-finding finite automaton, construction of
parser tables, and the necessary optimizations in constructing a deterministic
parser. Our system is motivated by an application from artificial intelligence
plan recognition. We argue for the correctness of the system, and discuss
future extensions of this work."
"A test set for a formal language (set of strings) L is a subset T of L such
that for any two string homomorphisms f and g defined on L, if the restrictions
of f and g on T are identical functions, then f and g are identical on the
entire L. Previously, it was shown that there are context-free grammars for
which smallest test sets are cubic in the size of the grammar, which gives a
lower bound on tests set size. Existing upper bounds were higher degree
polynomials; we here give the first algorithm to compute test sets of cubic
size for all context-free grammars, settling the gap between the upper and
lower bound."
"A condition characterizing the class of regular languages which have several
nonisomorphic minimal reversible automata is presented. The condition concerns
the structure of the minimum automaton accepting the language under
consideration. It is also observed that there exist reduced reversible automata
which are not minimal, in the sense that all the automata obtained by merging
some of their equivalent states are irreversible. Furthermore, a sufficient
condition for the existence of infinitely many reduced reversible automata
accepting a same language is given. It is also proved that, when the language
is accepted by a unique minimal reversible automaton (that does not necessarily
coincide with the minimum deterministic automaton), then no other reduced
reversible automata accepting it can exist."
"In this paper we consider the class of lambda-nondeterministic linear
automata as a model of the class of linear languages. As usual in other
automata models, lambda-moves do not increase the acceptance power. The main
contribution of this paper is to introduce the deterministic linear automata
and even linear automata, i.e. the natural restriction of nondeterministic
linear automata for the deterministic and even linear language classes,
respectively. In particular, there are different, but not equivalents,
proposals for the class of ""deterministic"" linear languages. We proved here
that the class of languages accepted by the deterministic linear automata are
not contained in any of the these classes and in fact they properly contain
these classes. Another, contribution is the generation of an infinite hierarchy
of formal languages, going from the class of languages accepted by
deterministic linear automata and achieved, in the limit, the class of linear
languages."
"We investigate the computational power of affine automata (AfAs) introduced
in [4]. In particular, we present a simpler proof for how to change the
cutpoint for any affine language and a method how to reduce error in bounded
error case. Moreover, we address to the question of [4] by showing that any
affine language can be recognized by an AfA with certain limitation on the
entries of affine states and transition matrices. Lastly, we present the first
languages shown to be not recognized by AfAs with bounded-error."
"Weighted automata over the max-plus semiring S are closely related to
finitely generated semigroups of matrices over S. In this paper, we use results
in automata theory to study two quantities associated with sets of matrices:
the joint spectral radius and the ultimate rank. We prove that these two
quantities are not computable over the tropical semiring, i.e. there is no
algorithm that takes as input a finite set of matrices M and provides as output
the joint spectral radius (resp. the ultimate rank) of M. On the other hand, we
prove that the joint spectral radius is nevertheless approximable and we
exhibit restricted cases in which the joint spectral radius and the ultimate
rank are computable. To reach this aim, we study the problem of comparing
functions computed by weighted automata over the tropical semiring. This
problem is known to be undecidable and we prove that it remains undecidable in
some specific subclasses of automata."
"Planar automata seems to be representative of the synchronizing behavior of
deterministic finite state automata. We conjecture that \v{C}erny's conjecture
holds true, if and only if, it holds true for planar automata. In this paper we
have gathered some evidence concerning this conjecture. This evidence amounts
to show that the class of planar automata is representative of the algorithmic
hardness of synchronization"
"We introduce saturation of nondeterministic tree automata, a technique that
consists of adding new transitions to an automaton while preserving its
language. We implemented our algorithm on minotaut - a module of the tree
automata library libvata that reduces the size of automata by merging states
and removing superfluous transitions - and we show how saturation can make
subsequent merge and transition-removal operations more effective. Thus we
obtain a Ptime algorithm that reduces the size of tree automata even more than
before. Additionally, we explore how minotaut alone can play an important role
when performing hard operations like complementation, allowing to both obtain
smaller complement automata and lower computation times. We then show how
saturation can extend this contribution even further. We tested our algorithms
on a large collection of automata from applications of libvata in shape
analysis, and on different classes of randomly generated automata."
"We investigate a subclass of languages recognized by vector addition systems,
namely languages of nondeterministic Parikh automata. While the regularity
problem (is the language of a given automaton regular?) is undecidable for this
model, we show surprising decidability of the regular separability problem:
given two Parikh automata, is there a regular language that contains one of
them and is disjoint from the other?"
"We introduce here the notion of syntactic lattice algebra which is an analogy
of the syntactic monoid and of the syntactic semiring. We present a unified
approach to get those three structures."
"This paper situates itself in the theory of variable length codes and of
finite automata where the concepts of completeness and synchronization play a
central role. In this theoretical setting, we investigate the problem of
finding upper bounds to the minimal length of synchronizing words and
incompletable words of a finite language X in terms of the length of the words
of X. This problem is related to two well-known conjectures formulated by Cerny
and Restivo, respectively. In particular, if Restivo's conjecture is true, our
main result provides a quadratic bound for the minimal length of a
synchronizing pair of any finite synchronizing complete code with respect to
the maximal length of its words."
"Families of DFAs (FDFAs) provide an alternative formalism for recognizing
$\omega$-regular languages. The motivation for introducing them was a desired
correlation between the automaton states and right congruence relations, in a
manner similar to the Myhill-Nerode theorem for regular languages. This
correlation is beneficial for learning algorithms, and indeed it was recently
shown that $\omega$-regular languages can be learned from membership and
equivalence queries, using FDFAs as the acceptors.
  In this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for
defining omega-regular languages. Specifically, we look into the complexity of
performing Boolean operations, such as complementation and intersection, on
FDFAs, the complexity of solving decision problems, such as emptiness and
language containment, and the succinctness of FDFAs compared to standard
deterministic and nondeterministic $\omega$-automata.
  We show that FDFAs enjoy the benefits of deterministic automata with respect
to Boolean operations and decision problems. Namely, they can all be performed
in nondeterministic logarithmic space. We provide polynomial translations of
deterministic B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi automata to FDFAs and of FDFAs to
nondeterministic B\""uchi automata (NBAs). We show that translation of an NBA to
an FDFA may involve an exponential blowup. Last, we show that FDFAs are more
succinct than deterministic parity automata (DPAs) in the sense that
translating a DPA to an FDFA can always be done with only a polynomial
increase, yet the other direction involves an inevitable exponential blowup in
the worst case."
"For any functions $f(x)$, $g(x)$ from $\mathbb {N}$ to $\mathbb {R}$ we call
repeats $uvu$ such that $g(|u|)\le |v|\le f(|u|)$ as {\it $f,g$-gapped
repeats}. We study the possible number of $f,g$-gapped repeats in words of
fixed length~$n$. For quite weak conditions on $f(x)$, $g(x)$ we obtain an
upper bound on this number which is linear to~$n$."
"We present a direct transformation of weak alternating $\omega$-automata into
equivalent backward deterministic $\omega$-automata and show (1) how it can be
used to obtain a transformation of non-deterministic B\""uchi automata into
equivalent backward deterministic automata and (2) that it yields optimal
equivalent backward deterministic automata when applied to linear-time temporal
logic formulas. (1) uses the alternation-free fragment of the linear-time
$\mu$-calculus as an intermediate step; (2) is based on the straightforward
translation of linear-time temporal logic into weak alternating
$\omega$-automata."
"Functional transductions realized by two-way transducers (equivalently, by
streaming transducers and by MSO transductions) are the natural and standard
notion of ""regular"" mappings from words to words. It was shown recently
(LICS'13) that it is decidable if such a transduction can be implemented by
some one-way transducer, but the given algorithm has non-elementary complexity.
We provide an algorithm of different flavor solving the above question, that
has double exponential space complexity. We further apply our technique to
decide whether the transduction realized by a two-way transducer can be
implemented by a sweeping transducer, with either known or unknown number of
passes."
"The regular separability problem asks, for two given languages, if there
exists a regular language including one of them but disjoint from the other.
Our main result is decidability, and PSpace-completeness, of the regular
separability problem for languages of one counter automata without zero tests
(also known as one counter nets). This contrasts with undecidability of the
regularity problem for one counter nets, and with undecidability of the regular
separability problem for one counter automata, which is our second result."
"We study descriptive complexity properties of the class of regular bifix-free
languages, which is the intersection of prefix-free and suffix-free regular
languages. We show that there exist a single ternary universal (stream of)
bifix-free languages that meet all the bounds for the state complexity basic
operations (Boolean operations, product, star, and reversal). This is in
contrast with suffix-free languages, where it is known that there does not
exist such a stream. Then we present a stream of bifix-free languages that is
most complex in terms of all basic operations, syntactic complexity, and the
number of atoms and their complexities, which requires a superexponential
alphabet.
  We also complete the previous results by characterizing state complexity of
product, star, and reversal, and establishing tight upper bounds for atom
complexities of bifix-free languages. We show that to meet the bound for
reversal we require at least 3 letters and to meet the bound for atom
complexities $n+1$ letters are sufficient and necessary. For the cases of
product, star, and reversal we show that there are no gaps (magic numbers) in
the interval of possible state complexities of the languages resulted from an
operation; in particular, the state complexity of the product $L_m L_n$ is
always $m+n-2$, while of the star is either $n-1$ or $n-2$."
"A regular language $L$ is non-returning if in the minimal deterministic
finite automaton accepting it there are no transitions into the initial state.
Eom, Han and Jir\'askov\'a derived upper bounds on the state complexity of
boolean operations and Kleene star, and proved that these bounds are tight
using two different binary witnesses. They derived upper bounds for
concatenation and reversal using three different ternary witnesses. These five
witnesses use a total of six different transformations. We show that for each
$n\ge 4$ there exists a ternary witness of state complexity $n$ that meets the
bound for reversal and that at least three letters are needed to meet this
bound. Moreover, the restrictions of this witness to binary alphabets meet the
bounds for product, star, and boolean operations. We also derive tight upper
bounds on the state complexity of binary operations that take arguments with
different alphabets. We prove that the maximal syntactic semigroup of a
non-returning language has $(n-1)^n$ elements and requires at least
$\binom{n}{2}$ generators. We find the maximal state complexities of atoms of
non-returning languages. Finally, we show that there exists a most complex
non-returning language that meets the bounds for all these complexity measures."
"Synthesis from examples enables non-expert users to generate programs by
specifying examples of their behavior. A domain-specific form of such synthesis
has been recently deployed in a widely used spreadsheet software product. In
this paper we contribute to foundations of such techniques and present a
complete algorithm for synthesis of a class of recursive functions defined by
structural recursion over a given algebraic data type definition. The functions
we consider map an algebraic data type to a string; they are useful for, e.g.,
pretty printing and serialization of programs and data. We formalize our
problem as learning deterministic sequential top-down tree-to-string
transducers with a single state.
  The first problem we consider is learning a tree-to-string transducer from
any set of input/output examples provided by the user. We show that this
problem is NP-complete in general, but can be solved in polynomial time under a
(practically useful) closure condition that each subtree of a tree in the
input/output example set is also part of the input/output examples.
  Because coming up with relevant input/output examples may be difficult for
the user while creating hard constraint problems for the synthesizer, we also
study a more automated active learning scenario in which the algorithm chooses
the inputs for which the user provides the outputs. Our algorithm asks a
worst-case linear number of queries as a function of the size of the algebraic
data type definition to determine a unique transducer."
"Weighted automata (WA) are an important formalism to describe quantitative
properties. Obtaining equivalent deterministic machines is a longstanding
research problem. In this paper we consider WA with a set semantics, meaning
that the semantics is given by the set of weights of accepting runs. We focus
on multi-sequential WA that are defined as finite unions of sequential WA. The
problem we address is to minimize the size of this union. We call this minimum
the degree of sequentiality of (the relation realized by) the WA. For a given
positive integer k, we provide multiple characterizations of relations realized
by a union of k sequential WA over an infinitary finitely generated group: a
Lipschitz-like machine independent property, a pattern on the automaton (a new
twinning property) and a subclass of cost register automata. When possible, we
effectively translate a WA into an equivalent union of k sequential WA. We also
provide a decision procedure for our twinning property for commutative
computable groups thus allowing to compute the degree of sequentiality. Last,
we show that these results also hold for word transducers and that the
associated decision problem is Pspace-complete."
"We show how up-to techniques for (bi-)similarity can be used in the setting
of weighted systems. The problems we consider are language equivalence,
language inclusion and the threshold problem (also known as universality
problem) for weighted automata. We build a bisimulation relation on the fly and
work up-to congruence and up-to similarity. This requires to determine whether
a pair of vectors (over a semiring) is in the congruence closure of a given
relation of vectors. This problem is considered for rings and l-monoids, for
the latter we provide a rewriting algorithm and show its confluence and
termination. We then explain how to apply these up-to techniques to weighted
automata and provide runtime results."
"We consider the problem of state-space reduction for nondeterministic
weakly-hierarchical visibly pushdown automata (VPA). VPA recognize a robust and
algorithmically tractable fragment of context-free languages that is natural
for modeling programs.
  We define an equivalence relation that is sufficient for language-preserving
quotienting of VPA. Our definition allows to merge states that have different
behavior, as long as they show the same behavior for reachable equivalent
stacks. We encode the existence of such a relation as a Boolean partial maximum
satisfiability (PMax-SAT) problem and present an algorithm that quickly finds
satisfying assignments. These assignments are sub-optimal solutions to the
PMax-SAT problem but can still lead to a significant reduction of states.
  We integrated our method in the automata-based software verifier Ultimate
Automizer and show performance improvements on benchmarks from the software
verification competition SV-COMP."
"We present a new series of examples of binary slowly synchronizing automata
with sink state. The reset threshold of the $n$-state automaton in this series
is $\frac{n^2}{4}+2n-9$. This improves on the previously known lower bound for
the maximum reset threshold of binary synchronizing $n$-state automata with
sink state."
"Let S be a complete star-omega semiring and A be an alphabet. For a weighted
omega-restricted one counter automaton C with stateset {1,..., n}, for n
greater than or equal to 1, we show that there exists a mixed algebraic system
over a complete semiring-semimodule pair ((S <<A*>>)^(n x n),(S <<
A^{omega}>>)^n) such that the behavior of C is a component of a solution of
this system. In case the basic semiring is the Boolean one or N^{\infty} we
show that there exists a mixed context-free grammar that generates the
behaviour of C.
  The construction of the mixed context-free grammar from C is a generalization
of the well known triple construction in case of restricted one counter
automata and is called now triple-pair construction for omega-restricted one
counter automata."
"A weight normalization procedure, commonly called pushing, is introduced for
weighted tree automata (wta) over commutative semifields. The normalization
preserves the recognized weighted tree language even for nondeterministic wta,
but it is most useful for bottom-up deterministic wta, where it can be used for
minimization and equivalence testing. In both applications a careful selection
of the weights to be redistributed followed by normalization allows a reduction
of the general problem to the corresponding problem for bottom-up deterministic
unweighted tree automata. This approach was already successfully used by Mohri
and Eisner for the minimization of deterministic weighted string automata.
Moreover, the new equivalence test for two wta $M$ and $M'$ runs in time
$\mathcal O((\lvert M \rvert + \lvert M'\rvert) \cdot \log {(\lvert Q\rvert +
\lvert Q'\rvert)})$, where $Q$ and $Q'$ are the states of $M$ and $M'$,
respectively, which improves the previously best run-time $\mathcal O(\lvert M
\rvert \cdot \lvert M'\rvert)$."
"Using a novel rewriting problem, we show that several natural decision
problems about finite automata are undecidable (i.e., recursively unsolvable).
In contrast, we also prove three related problems are decidable. We apply one
result to prove the undecidability of a related problem about k-automatic sets
of rational numbers."
"In this paper, the author aims to establish a mathematical model for a mimic
computer. To this end, a novel automaton is proposed. First, a one-dimensional
cellular automaton is used for expressing some dynamic changes in the structure
of a computing unit, a sequential automaton is employed to describe some state
transitions, a hierarchical automaton is employed to express the different
granularities of some computing units, and a probabilistic automaton is used to
depict some random changes of a computing unit. Second, the new automaton is
obtained by combining the various types of automata mentioned above in the
certain logical relationship. To the best of our knowledge, the new automaton
model is the first automaton which can portray the operation semantics for a
mimic computing system, and it can directly describe some behaviors of a mimic
computer."
"The \emph{word problem} of a group $G = \langle \Sigma \rangle$ can be
defined as the set of formal words in $\Sigma^*$ that represent the identity in
$G$. When viewed as formal languages, this gives a strong connection between
classes of groups and classes of formal languages. For example, Anisimov showed
that a group is finite if and only if its word problem is a regular language,
and Muller and Schupp showed that a group is virtually-free if and only if its
word problem is a context-free language. Above this, not much was known, until
Salvati showed recently that the word problem of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is multiple
context-free, giving first such example. We generalize Salvati's result to show
that the word problem of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a multiple context-free language for
any $n$."
"We study the following natural variation on the classical universality
problem: given an automaton $M$ of some type (DFA/NFA/PDA), does there exist an
integer $\ell \geq 0$ such that $\Sigma^\ell \subseteq L(M)$? The case of an
NFA was an open problem since 2009. Here, using a novel and deep construction,
we prove that the problem is NEXPTIME-complete, and the smallest such $\ell$
can be doubly exponential in the number of states. In the case of a DFA the
problem is NP-complete, and there exist examples for which the smallest such
$\ell$ is of the form $e^{\sqrt{n \log n} (1+o(1))}$, which is best possible,
where $n$ is the number of states. In the case of a PDA this problem is
recursively unsolvable, while the smallest such $\ell$ cannot be bounded in the
number of states by any computable function. Finally, we show that in all the
cases the problem becomes computationally easier when the length $\ell$ is also
given in the input."
"In the last years renewed investigation of operator precedence languages
(OPL) led to discover important properties thereof: OPL are closed with respect
to all major operations, are characterized, besides the original grammar
family, in terms of an automata family and an MSO logic; furthermore they
significantly generalize the well-known visibly pushdown languages (VPL). In
another area of research, quantitative models of systems are also greatly in
demand. In this paper, we lay the foundation to marry these two research
fields. We introduce weighted operator precedence automata and show how they
are both strict extensions of OPA and weighted visibly pushdown automata. We
prove a Nivat-like result which shows that quantitative OPL can be described by
unweighted OPA and very particular weighted OPA. In a B\""uchi-like theorem, we
show that weighted OPA are expressively equivalent to a weighted MSO-logic for
OPL."
"We survey recent results concerning the complexity of regular languages
represented by their minimal deterministic finite automata. In addition to the
quotient complexity of the language -- which is the number of its (left)
quotients, and is the same as its state complexity -- we also consider the size
of its syntactic semigroup and the quotient complexity of its atoms -- basic
components of every regular language. We then turn to the study of the
quotient/state complexity of common operations on regular languages: reversal,
(Kleene) star, product (concatenation) and boolean operations. We examine
relations among these complexity measures. We discuss several subclasses of
regular languages defined by convexity. In many, but not all, cases there exist
""most complex"" languages, languages satisfying all these complexity measures."
"We investigate languages recognized by well structured transition systems
(WSTS) with upward (resp. downward) compatibility. We show that under mild
assumptions every two disjoint WSTS languages are regular separable, i.e.,
there exists a regular language containing one of them and disjoint from the
other. In particular, if a language, as well as its complement, are both
recognized by a WSTS, then they are necessarily regular."
"We improve the best upper bound on the length of the shortest reset words of
synchronizing automata. The new bound is $(15617 n^3 + 7500 n^2 + 9375 n -
31250)/93750$. So far, the best general upper bound was $(n^3-n)/6-1$ obtained
by Pin and Frankl in 1982. Despite a number of efforts, the bound remained
unchanged for about 35 years. The new upper bound improves the coefficient
$1/6$ at $n^3$ by $4/46875$.
  A word is avoiding for a state $q$ if after reading the word, the automaton
cannot be in $q$. We prove an upper bound on the length of a word that is
either avoiding or compressing a subset. Then we show a quadratic bound on the
length of the shortest avoiding words, and, using the approach of Trahtman from
2011, we improve the general upper bound on the length of the shortest reset
words. For all the bounds, there exist polynomial algorithms finding a word of
length not exceeding the bound."
"In this paper we consider the problem of context-free grammars comparison
from the analysis point of view. We show that the problem can be reduced to
numerical solution of systems of nonlinear matrix equations. The approach
presented here forms a basis for probabilistic comparison algorithms oriented
to automatic assessment of of student's answers in computer science."
"We present two structural results concerning longest common prefixes of
non-empty languages. First, we show that the longest common prefix of the
language generated by a context-free grammar of size $N$ equals the longest
common prefix of the same grammar where the heights of the derivation trees are
bounded by $4N$. Second, we show that each nonempty language $L$ has a
representative subset of at most three elements which behaves like $L$ w.r.t.
the longest common prefix as well as w.r.t. longest common prefixes of $L$
after unions or concatenations with arbitrary other languages. From that, we
conclude that the longest common prefix, and thus the longest common suffix, of
a context-free language can be computed in polynomial time."
"Deterministic two-way transducers define the robust class of regular
functions which is, among other good properties, closed under composition.
However, the best known algorithms for composing two-way transducers cause a
double exponential blow-up in the size of the inputs. In this paper, we
introduce a class of transducers for which the composition has polynomial
complexity. It is the class of reversible transducers, for which the
computation steps can be reversed deterministically. While in the one-way
setting this class is not very expressive, we prove that any two-way transducer
can be made reversible through a single exponential blow-up. As a consequence,
we prove that the composition of two-way transducers can be done with a single
exponential blow-up in the number of states. A uniformization of a relation is
a function with the same domain and which is included in the original relation.
Our main result actually states that we can uniformize any non-deterministic
two-way transducer by a reversible transducer with a single exponential
blow-up, improving the known result by de Souza which has a quadruple
exponential complexity. As a side result, our construction also gives a
quadratic transformation from copyless streaming string transducers to two-way
transducers, improving the exponential previous bound."
"It is well known that the ""store language"" of every pushdown automaton -- the
set of store configurations (state and stack contents) that can appear as an
intermediate step in accepting computations -- is a regular language. Here many
models of language acceptors with various data structures are examined, along
with a study of their store languages. For each model, an attempt is made to
find the simplest model that accepts their store languages. Some connections
between store languages of one-way and two-way machines generally are
demonstrated, as with connections between nondeterministic and deterministic
machines. A nice application of these store language results is also presented,
showing a general technique for proving families accepted by many deterministic
models are closed under right quotient with regular languages, resolving some
open questions (and significantly simplifying proofs for others that are known)
in the literature. Lower bounds on the space complexity for recognizing store
languages for the languages to be non-regular are obtained."
"We investigate the class of regular-ordered word equations. In such
equations, each variable occurs at most once in each side and the order of the
variables occurring in both sides is the preserved (the variables can be,
however, separated by potentially distinct constant factors). Surprisingly, we
obtain that solving such simple equations, even when the sides contain exactly
the same variables, is NP-hard. By considerations regarding the combinatorial
structure of the minimal solutions of the more general quadratic equations we
obtain that the satisfiability problem for regular-ordered equations is in NP.
Finally, we also show that a related class of simple word equations, that
generalises one-variable equations, is in P."
"We develop a new bisimulation (pseudo)metric for weighted finite automata
(WFA) that generalizes Boreale's linear bisimulation relation. Our metrics are
induced by seminorms on the state space of WFA. Our development is based on
spectral properties of sets of linear operators. In particular, the joint
spectral radius of the transition matrices of WFA plays a central role. We also
study continuity properties of the bisimulation pseudometric, establish an
undecidability result for computing the metric, and give a preliminary account
of applications to spectral learning of weighted automata."
"Difference hierarchies were originally introduced by Hausdorff and they play
an important role in descriptive set theory. In this survey paper, we study
difference hierarchies of regular languages. The first sections describe
standard techniques on difference hierarchies, mostly due to Hausdorff. We
illustrate these techniques by giving decidability results on the difference
hierarchies based on shuffle ideals, strongly cyclic regular languages and the
polynomial closure of group languages."
"One of the major open problems in automata and logic is the following: is
there an algorithm which inputs a regular tree language and decides if the
language can be defined in first-order logic? The goal of this paper is to
present this problem and similar ones using the language of universal algebra,
highlighting potential connections to the structural theory of finite algebras,
including Tame Congruence Theory."
"This work considers weak deterministic B\""uchi automata reading encodings of
non-negative $d$-vectors of reals in a fixed base. A saturated language is a
language which contains all encoding of elements belonging to a set of
$d$-vectors of reals. A Real Vector Automaton is an automaton which recognizes
a saturated language. It is explained how to decide in quasi-linear time
whether a minimal weak deterministic B\""uchi automaton is a Real Vector
Automaton. The problem is solved both for the two standard encodings of vectors
of numbers: the sequential encoding and the parallel encoding. This algorithm
runs in linear time for minimal weak B\""uchi automata accepting set of reals.
Finally, the same problem is also solved for parallel encoding of automata
reading vectors of relative reals."
"We consider the complexity of Green's relations when the semigroup is given
by transformations on a finite set. Green's relations can be defined by
reachability in the (right/left/two-sided) Cayley graph. The equivalence
classes then correspond to the strongly connected components. It is not
difficult to show that, in the worst case, the number of equivalence classes is
in the same order of magnitude as the number of elements. Another important
parameter is the maximal length of a chain of components. Our main contribution
is an exponential lower bound for this parameter. There is a simple
construction for an arbitrary set of generators. However, the proof for
constant alphabet is rather involved. Our results also apply to automata and
their syntactic semigroups."
"We introduce the concept of regular expression characteristics as a unified
way to concisely express bounds on time-series constraints. This allows us not
only to define time-series constraints in a compositional way, but also to deal
with their combinatorial aspect in a compositional way, without developing
ad-hoc bounds for each time-series constraint separately."
"We use a non-deterministic variant of storage types to develop a framework
for the approximation of automata with storage. This framework is used to
provide an automata-theoretic view on the approximation of multiple
context-free languages."
"In this paper the concept of Parikh-reducing Church-Rosser systems is
studied. It is shown that for two classes of regular languages there exist such
systems which describe the languages using finitely many equivalence classes of
the rewriting system. The two classes are: 1.) the class of all regular
languages such that the syntactic monoid contains only abelian groups and 2.)
the class of all group languages over a two-letter alphabet. The construction
of the systems yield a monoid representation such that all subgroups are
abelian. Additionally, the complexity of those representations is studied."
"Automata learning is a technique that has successfully been applied in
verification, with the automaton type varying depending on the application
domain. Adaptations of automata learning algorithms for increasingly complex
types of automata have to be developed from scratch because there was no
abstract theory offering guidelines. This makes it hard to devise such
algorithms, and it obscures their correctness proofs. We introduce a simple
category-theoretic formalism that provides an appropriately abstract foundation
for studying automata learning. Furthermore, our framework establishes formal
relations between algorithms for learning, testing, and minimization. We
illustrate its generality with two examples: deterministic and weighted
automata."
"We formalize and analyze a new problem in formal language theory termed
control improvisation. Given a specification language, the problem is to
produce an improviser, a probabilistic algorithm that randomly generates words
in the language, subject to two additional constraints: the satisfaction of a
quantitative soft constraint, and the exhibition of a specified amount of
randomness. Control improvisation has many applications, including for example
systematically generating random test vectors satisfying format constraints or
preconditions while being similar to a library of seed inputs. Other
applications include robotic surveillance, machine improvisation of music, and
randomized variants of the supervisory control problem. We describe a general
framework for solving the control improvisation problem, and use it to give
efficient algorithms for several practical classes of instances with finite
automaton and context-free grammar specifications. We also provide a detailed
complexity analysis, establishing #P-hardness of the problem in many other
cases. For these intractable cases, we show how symbolic techniques based on
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers can be used to find approximate solutions.
Finally, we discuss an extension of control improvisation to multiple soft
constraints that is useful in some applications."
"Piecewise testable languages form the first level of the Straubing-Th\'erien
hierarchy. The membership problem for this level is decidable and testing if
the language of a DFA is piecewise testable is NL-complete. The question has
not yet been addressed for NFAs. We fill in this gap by showing that it is
PSpace-complete. The main result is then the lower-bound complexity of
separability of regular languages by piecewise testable languages. Two regular
languages are separable by a piecewise testable language if the piecewise
testable language includes one of them and is disjoint from the other. For
languages represented by NFAs, separability by piecewise testable languages is
known to be decidable in PTime. We show that it is PTime-hard and that it
remains PTime-hard even for minimal DFAs."
"An automaton is partially ordered if the only cycles in its transition
diagram are self-loops. The expressivity of partially ordered NFAs (poNFAs) can
be characterized by the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Level 3/2 is recognized
by poNFAs, level 1 by confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs as well as by
confluent poDFAs, and level 1/2 by saturated poNFAs. We study the universality
problem for confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs. It asks whether an
automaton accepts all words over its alphabet. Universality for both NFAs and
poNFAs is a PSpace-complete problem. For confluent, self-loop deterministic
poNFAs, the complexity drops to coNP-complete if the alphabet is fixed but is
open if the alphabet may grow. We solve this problem by showing that it is
PSpace-complete if the alphabet may grow polynomially. Consequently, our result
provides a lower-bound complexity for some other problems, including inclusion,
equivalence, and $k$-piecewise testability. Since universality for saturated
poNFAs is easy, confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs are the simplest and
natural kind of NFAs characterizing a well-known class of languages, for which
deciding universality is as difficult as for general NFAs."
"A word $w$ is \emph{extending} a subset of states $S$ of a deterministic
finite automaton, if the set of states mapped to $S$ by $w$ (the preimage of
$S$ under the action of $w$) is larger than $S$. This notion together with its
variations has particular importance in the field of synchronizing automata,
where a number of methods and algorithms rely on finding (short) extending
words. In this paper we study the complexity of several variants of extending
word problems: deciding whether there exists an extending word, an extending
word that extends to the whole set of states, a word avoiding a state, and a
word that either extends or shrinks the subset. Additionally, we study the
complexity of these problems when an upper bound on the length of the word is
also given, and we consider the subclasses of strongly connected,
synchronizing, binary, and unary automata. We show either hardness or
polynomial algorithms for the considered variants."
"We investigate the Busy Beaver Game introduced by Rado (1962) generalized to
non-binary alphabets. Harland (2016) conjectured that activity (number of
steps) and productivity (number of non-blank symbols) of candidate machines
grow as the alphabet size increases. We prove this conjecture for any alphabet
size under the condition that the number of states is sufficiently large. For
the measure activity we show that increasing the alphabet size from two to
three allows an increase. By a classical construction it is even possible to
obtain a two-state machine increasing activity and productivity of any machine
if we allow an alphabet size depending on the number of states of the original
machine. We also show that an increase of the alphabet by a factor of three
admits an increase of activity."
"In this dissertation we study regular expression based parsing and the use of
grammatical specifications for the synthesis of fast, streaming
string-processing programs.
  In the first part we develop two linear-time algorithms for regular
expression based parsing with Perl-style greedy disambiguation. The first
algorithm operates in two passes in a semi-streaming fashion, using a constant
amount of working memory and an auxiliary tape storage which is written in the
first pass and consumed by the second. The second algorithm is a single-pass
and optimally streaming algorithm which outputs as much of the parse tree as is
semantically possible based on the input prefix read so far, and resorts to
buffering as many symbols as is required to resolve the next choice. Optimality
is obtained by performing a PSPACE-complete pre-analysis on the regular
expression.
  In the second part we present Kleenex, a language for expressing
high-performance streaming string processing programs as regular grammars with
embedded semantic actions, and its compilation to streaming string transducers
with worst-case linear-time performance. Its underlying theory is based on
transducer decomposition into oracle and action machines, and a finite-state
specialization of the streaming parsing algorithm presented in the first part.
In the second part we also develop a new linear-time streaming parsing
algorithm for parsing expression grammars (PEG) which generalizes the regular
grammars of Kleenex. The algorithm is based on a bottom-up tabulation algorithm
reformulated using least fixed points and evaluated using an instance of the
chaotic iteration scheme by Cousot and Cousot."
"Regular languages (RL) are the simplest family in Chomsky's hierarchy. Thanks
to their simplicity they enjoy various nice algebraic and logic properties that
have been successfully exploited in many application fields. Practically all of
their related problems are decidable, so that they support automatic
verification algorithms. Also, they can be recognized in real-time.
  Context-free languages (CFL) are another major family well-suited to
formalize programming, natural, and many other classes of languages; their
increased generative power w.r.t. RL, however, causes the loss of several
closure properties and of the decidability of important problems; furthermore
they need complex parsing algorithms. Thus, various subclasses thereof have
been defined with different goals, spanning from efficient, deterministic
parsing to closure properties, logic characterization and automatic
verification techniques.
  Among CFL subclasses, so-called structured ones, i.e., those where the
typical tree-structure is visible in the sentences, exhibit many of the
algebraic and logic properties of RL, whereas deterministic CFL have been
thoroughly exploited in compiler construction and other application fields.
  After surveying and comparing the main properties of those various language
families, we go back to operator precedence languages (OPL), an old family
through which R. Floyd pioneered deterministic parsing, and we show that they
offer unexpected properties in two fields so far investigated in totally
independent ways: they enable parsing parallelization in a more effective way
than traditional sequential parsers, and exhibit the same algebraic and logic
properties so far obtained only for less expressive language families."
"A tower is a sequence of words alternating between two languages in such a
way that every word is a subsequence of the following word. The height of the
tower is the number of words in the sequence. If there is no infinite tower (a
tower of infinite height), then the height of all towers between the languages
is bounded. We study upper and lower bounds on the height of maximal finite
towers with respect to the size of the NFA (the DFA) representation of the
languages. We show that the upper bound is polynomial in the number of states
and exponential in the size of the alphabet, and that it is asymptotically
tight if the size of the alphabet is fixed. If the alphabet may grow, then,
using an alphabet of size approximately the number of states of the automata,
the lower bound on the height of towers is exponential with respect to that
number. In this case, there is a gap between the lower and upper bound, and the
asymptotically optimal bound remains an open problem. Since, in many cases, the
constructed towers are sequences of prefixes, we also study towers of prefixes."
"Alternating automata have been widely used to model and verify systems that
handle data from finite domains, such as communication protocols or hardware.
The main advantage of the alternating model of computation is that
complementation is possible in linear time, thus allowing to concisely encode
trace inclusion problems that occur often in verification. In this paper we
consider alternating automata over infinite alphabets, whose transition rules
are formulae in a combined theory of booleans and some infinite data domain,
that relate past and current values of the data variables. The data theory is
not fixed, but rather it is a parameter of the class. We show that union,
intersection and complementation are possible in linear time in this model and,
though the emptiness problem is undecidable, we provide two efficient
semi-algorithms, inspired by two state-of-the-art abstraction refinement model
checking methods: lazy predicate abstraction \cite{HJMS02} and the \impact~
semi-algorithm \cite{mcmillan06}. We have implemented both methods and report
the results of an experimental comparison."
"G. Fici proved that a finite word has a minimal suffix automaton if and only
if all its left special factors occur as prefixes. He called LSP all finite and
infinite words having this latter property. We characterize here infinite LSP
words in terms of $S$-adicity. More precisely we provide a finite set of
morphisms $S$ and an automaton ${\cal A}$ such that an infinite word is LSP if
and only if it is $S$-adic and all its directive words are recognizable by
${\cal A}$."
"Pomsets constitute one of the most basic models of concurrency. A pomset is a
generalisation of a word over an alphabet in that letters may be partially
ordered. A term $t$ using the bi-Kleene operations $0,1, +, \cdot\, ,^*,
\parallel, ^{(*)}$ defines a language $ \mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] } $
of pomsets in a natural way.
  We prove that every valid universal equality over pomset languages using
these operations is a consequence of the equational theory of regular languages
(in which parallel multiplication and iteration are undefined) plus that of the
commutative-regular languages (in which sequential multiplication and iteration
are undefined). We also show that the class of $\textit{rational}$ pomset
languages (that is, those languages generated from singleton pomsets using the
bi-Kleene operations) is closed under all Boolean operations.
  An $ \textit{ideal}$ of a pomset $p$ is a pomset using the letters of $p$,
but having an ordering at least as strict as $p$. A bi-Kleene term $t$ thus
defines the set $ \textbf{Id} (\mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] }) $ of
ideals of pomsets in $ \mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] } $. We prove that if
$t$ does not contain commutative iteration $^{(*)}$ (in our terminology, $t$ is
bw-rational) then $\textbf{Id} (\mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] }) \cap
\textbf{Pom}_{sp}$, where $ \textbf{Pom}_{sp}$ is the set of pomsets generated
from singleton pomsets using sequential and parallel multiplication ($ \cdot$
and $ \parallel$) is defined by a bw-rational term, and if two such terms
$t,t'$ define the same ideal language, then $t'=t$ is provable from the Kleene
axioms for $0,1, +, \cdot\, ,^*$ plus the commutative idempotent semiring
axioms for $0,1, +, \parallel$ plus the exchange law $ (u \parallel v)\cdot ( x
\parallel y) \le v \cdot y \parallel u \cdot x $."
"We introduce weighted regular tree grammars with storage as combination of
(a) regular tree grammars with storage and (b) weighted tree automata over
multioperator monoids. Each weighted regular tree grammar with storage
generates a weighted tree language, which is a mapping from the set of trees to
the multioperator monoid. We prove that, for multioperator monoids canonically
associated to particular strong bimonoids, the support of the generated
weighted tree languages can be generated by (unweighted) regular tree grammars
with storage. We characterize the class of all generated weighted tree
languages by the composition of three basic concepts. Moreover, we prove
results on the elimination of chain rules and of finite storage types, and we
characterize weighted regular tree grammars with storage by a new weighted
MSO-logic."
"We investigate the worst-case state complexity of reversals of deterministic
finite automata with output (DFAOs). In these automata, each state is assigned
some output value, rather than simply being labelled final or non-final. This
directly generalizes the well-studied problem of determining the worst-case
state complexity of reversals of ordinary deterministic finite automata. If a
DFAO has $n$ states and $k$ possible output values, there is a known upper
bound of $k^n$ for the state complexity of reversal. We show this bound can be
reached with a ternary input alphabet. We conjecture it cannot be reached with
a binary input alphabet except when $k = 2$, and give a lower bound for the
case $3 \le k < n$. We prove that the state complexity of reversal depends
solely on the transition monoid of the DFAO and the mapping that assigns output
values to states."
"The second author introduced with I. T\""orm\""a a two-player word-building
game [Playing with Subshifts, Fund. Inform. 132 (2014), 131--152]. The game has
a predetermined (possibly finite) choice sequence $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$,
$\ldots$ of integers such that on round $n$ the player $A$ chooses a subset
$S_n$ of size $\alpha_n$ of some fixed finite alphabet and the player $B$ picks
a letter from the set $S_n$. The outcome is determined by whether the word
obtained by concatenating the letters $B$ picked lies in a prescribed target
set $X$ (a win for player $A$) or not (a win for player $B$). Typically, we
consider $X$ to be a subshift. The winning shift $W(X)$ of a subshift $X$ is
defined as the set of choice sequences for which $A$ has a winning strategy
when the target set is the language of $X$. The winning shift $W(X)$ mirrors
some properties of $X$. For instance, $W(X)$ and $X$ have the same entropy.
Virtually nothing is known about the structure of the winning shifts of
subshifts common in combinatorics on words. In this paper, we study the winning
shifts of subshifts generated by marked uniform substitutions, and show that
these winning shifts, viewed as subshifts, also have a substitutive structure.
It is known that $W(X)$ and $X$ have the same factor complexity. We exploit
this connection to give a simple derivation of the first difference and factor
complexity functions of subshifts generated by marked substitutions. We
describe these functions in particular detail for the generalized Thue-Morse
substitutions."
"Floyd's Operator Precedence (OP) languages are a deterministic context-free
family having many desirable properties. They are locally and parallely
parsable, and languages having a compatible structure are closed under Boolean
operations, concatenation and star; they properly include the family of Visibly
Pushdown (or Input Driven) languages. OP languages are based on three relations
between any two consecutive terminal symbols, which assign syntax structure to
words. We extend such relations to k-tuples of consecutive terminal symbols, by
using the model of strictly locally testable regular languages of order $k \ge
3$. The new corresponding class of Higher-order Operator Precedence languages
(HOP) properly includes the OP languages, and it is still included in the
deterministic (also in reverse) context free family. We prove Boolean closure
for each subfamily of structurally compatible HOP languages. In each subfamily,
the top language is called max-language. We show that such languages are
defined by a simple cancellation rule and we prove several properties, in
particular that max-languages make an infinite hierarchy ordered by parameter
k. HOP languages are a candidate for replacing OP languages in the various
applications where they have have been successful though sometimes too
restrictive."
"It is well-known that: (i) every context-free language over a singleton
terminal alphabet is regular, and (ii) the class of languages that satisfy the
Pumping Lemma is a proper super-class of the context-free languages. We show
that any language in this superclass over a singleton terminal alphabet is
regular. Our proof is based on a transformational approach and does not rely on
Parikh's Theorem. Our result extends previously known results because there are
languages that are not context-free, do satisfy the Pumping Lemma, and do not
satisfy the hypotheses of Parikh's Theorem."
"We introduce a model of one-way language acceptors (a variant of a checking
stack automaton) and show the following decidability properties: (1) The
deterministic version has a decidable membership problem but has an undecidable
emptiness problem. (2) The nondeterministic version has an undecidable
membership problem and emptiness problem.
  There are many models of accepting devices for which there is no difference
with these problems between deterministic and nondeterministic versions, i.e.,
the membership problem for both versions are either decidable or undecidable,
and the same holds for the emptiness problem. As far as we know, the model we
introduce above is the first one-way model to exhibit properties (1) and (2).
We define another family of one-way acceptors where the nondeterministic
version has an undecidable emptiness problem, but the deterministic version has
a decidable emptiness problem. We also know of no other model with this
property in the literature. We also investigate decidability properties of
other variations of checking stack automata (e.g., allowing multiple stacks,
two-way input, etc.). Surprisingly, two-way deterministic machines with
multiple checking stacks and multiple reversal-bounded counters are shown to
have a decidable membership problem, a very general model with this property."
"Reversible forms of computations are often interesting from an energy
efficiency point of view. When the computation device in question is an
automaton, it is known that the minimal reversible automaton recognizing a
given language is not necessarily unique, moreover, there are languages having
arbitrarily large reversible recognizers possessing no nontrivial ""reversible""
congruence. However, the exact characterization of this class of languages was
open. In this paper we give a forbidden pattern capturing the reversible
regular languages having only finitely many reduced reversible automata,
allowing an efficient ($\mathbf{NL}$) decision procedure."
"Br\""uggemann-Klein and Wood define a one-unambiguous regular language as a
language that can be recognized by a deterministic Glushkov automaton. They
give a procedure performed on the minimal DFA, the BW-test, to decide whether a
language is one-unambiguous. Block determinism is an extension of
one-unambiguity while considering non-empty words as symbols and
prefix-freeness as determinism. A block automaton is compact if it does not
have two equivalent states (same right language). We showed that a language is
$k$-block deterministic if it is recognized by some deterministic $k$-block
automaton passing the BW-test. In this paper, we show that any $k$-block
deterministic language is recognized by a compact deterministic $k$-block
automaton passing the BW-test. We also give a procedure which enumerates, for a
given language, the finite set of compact deterministic $k$-block automata. It
gives us a decidable procedure to test whether a language is $k$-block
deterministic."
"We study a pumping lemma for the word/tree languages generated by
higher-order grammars. Pumping lemmas are known up to order-2 word languages
(i.e., for regular/context-free/indexed languages), and have been used to show
that a given language does not belong to the classes of
regular/context-free/indexed languages. We prove a pumping lemma for word/tree
languages of arbitrary orders, modulo a conjecture that a higher-order version
of Kruskal's tree theorem holds. We also show that the conjecture indeed holds
for the order-2 case, which yields a pumping lemma for order-2 tree languages
and order-3 word languages."
"Sequentiable structures are a subclass of monoids that generalise the free
monoids and the monoid of non-negative real numbers with addition. In this
paper we consider functions $f:\Sigma^*\rightarrow {\cal M}$ and define the
Myhill-Nerode relation for these functions. We prove that a function of finite
index, $n$, can be represented with a subsequential transducer with $n$ states."
"This thesis is focused on techniques for finite automata and their use in
practice, with the main emphasis on nondeterministic tree automata. This
concerns namely techniques for size reduction and language inclusion testing,
which are two problems that are crucial for many applications of tree automata.
For size reduction of tree automata, we adapt the simulation quotient technique
that is well established for finite word automata. We give efficient algorithms
for computing tree automata simulations and we also introduce a new type of
relation that arises from a combination of tree automata downward and upward
simulation and that is very well suited for quotienting. The combination
principle is relevant also for word automata. We then generalise the so called
antichain universality and language inclusion checking technique developed
originally for finite word automata for tree automata. Subsequently, we improve
the antichain technique for both word and tree automata by combining it with
the simulation-based inclusion checking techniques, significantly improving
efficiency of the antichain method. We then show how the developed reduction
and inclusion checking methods improve the method of abstract regular tree
model checking, the method that was the original motivation for starting the
work on tree automata. Both the reduction and the language inclusion methods
are based on relatively simple and general principles that can be further
extended for other types of automata and related formalisms. An example is our
adaptation of the reduction methods for alternating B\""uchi automata, which
results in an efficient alternating automata size reduction technique."
"We compare pushdown automata (PDAs for short) against other representations.
First, we show that there is a family of PDAs over a unary alphabet with $n$
states and $p \geq 2n + 4$ stack symbols that accepts one single long word for
which every equivalent context-free grammar needs $\Omega(n^2(p-2n-4))$
variables. This family shows that the classical algorithm for converting a PDA
to an equivalent context-free grammar is optimal even when the alphabet is
unary. Moreover, we observe that language equivalence and Parikh equivalence,
which ignores the ordering between symbols, coincide for this family. We
conclude that, when assuming this weaker equivalence, the conversion algorithm
is also optimal. Second, Parikh's theorem motivates the comparison of PDAs
against finite state automata. In particular, the same family of unary PDAs
gives a lower bound on the number of states of every Parikh-equivalent finite
state automaton. Finally, we look into the case of unary deterministic PDAs. We
show a new construction converting a unary deterministic PDA into an equivalent
context-free grammar that achieves best known bounds."
"Nested weighted automata (NWA) present a robust and convenient
automata-theoretic formalism for quantitative specifications. Previous works
have considered NWA that processed input words only in the forward direction.
It is natural to allow the automata to process input words backwards as well,
for example, to measure the maximal or average time between a response and the
preceding request. We therefore introduce and study bidirectional NWA that can
process input words in both directions. First, we show that bidirectional NWA
can express interesting quantitative properties that are not expressible by
forward-only NWA. Second, for the fundamental decision problems of emptiness
and universality, we establish decidability and complexity results for the new
framework which match the best-known results for the special case of
forward-only NWA. Thus, for NWA, the increased expressiveness of
bidirectionality is achieved at no additional computational complexity. This is
in stark contrast to the unweighted case, where bidirectional finite automata
are no more expressive but exponentially more succinct than their forward-only
counterparts."
"In this paper, we investigate the expressive power and the algorithmic
properties of weighted expressions, which define functions from finite words to
integers. First, we consider a slight extension of an expression formalism,
introduced by Chatterjee. et. al. in the context of infinite words, by which to
combine values given by unambiguous (max,+)-automata, using Presburger
arithmetic. We show that important decision problems such as emptiness,
universality and comparison are PSpace-c for these expressions. We then
investigate the extension of these expressions with Kleene star. This allows to
iterate an expression over smaller fragments of the input word, and to combine
the results by taking their iterated sum. The decision problems turn out to be
undecidable, but we introduce the decidable and still expressive class of
synchronised expressions."
"The timed pattern matching problem is an actively studied topic because of
its relevance in monitoring of real-time systems. There one is given a log $w$
and a specification $\mathcal{A}$ (given by a timed word and a timed automaton
in this paper), and one wishes to return the set of intervals for which the log
$w$, when restricted to the interval, satisfies the specification
$\mathcal{A}$. In our previous work we presented an efficient timed pattern
matching algorithm: it adopts a skipping mechanism inspired by the classic
Boyer--Moore (BM) string matching algorithm. In this work we tackle the problem
of online timed pattern matching, towards embedded applications where it is
vital to process a vast amount of incoming data in a timely manner.
Specifically, we start with the Franek-Jennings-Smyth (FJS) string matching
algorithm---a recent variant of the BM algorithm---and extend it to timed
pattern matching. Our experiments indicate the efficiency of our FJS-type
algorithm in online and offline timed pattern matching."
"What is the common link, if there is any, between Church-Rosser systems,
prefix codes with bounded synchronization delay, and local Rees extensions? The
first obvious answer is that each of these notions relates to topics of
interest for WORDS: Church-Rosser systems are certain rewriting systems over
words, codes are given by sets of words which form a basis of a free submonoid
in the free monoid of all words (over a given alphabet) and local Rees
extensions provide structural insight into regular languages over words. So, it
seems to be a legitimate title for an extended abstract presented at the
conference WORDS 2017. However, this work is more ambitious, it outlines some
less obvious but much more interesting link between these topics. This link is
based on a structure theory of finite monoids with varieties of groups and the
concept of local divisors playing a prominent role. Parts of this work appeared
in a similar form in conference proceedings where proofs and further material
can be found."
"We consider the problem of evaluating in streaming (i.e. in a single
left-to-right pass) a nested word transduction with a limited amount of memory.
A transduction T is said to be height bounded memory (HBM) if it can be
evaluated with a memory that depends only on the size of T and on the height of
the input word. We show that it is decidable in coNPTime for a nested word
transduction defined by a visibly pushdown transducer (VPT), if it is HBM. In
this case, the required amount of memory may depend exponentially on the height
of the word. We exhibit a sufficient, decidable condition for a VPT to be
evaluated with a memory that depends quadratically on the height of the word.
This condition defines a class of transductions that strictly contains all
determinizable VPTs."
"PEGs were formalized by Ford in 2004, and have several pragmatic operators
(such as ordered choice and unlimited lookahead) for better expressing modern
programming language syntax. Since these operators are not explicitly defined
in the classic formal language theory, it is significant and still challenging
to argue PEGs' expressiveness in the context of formal language theory.Since
PEGs are relatively new, there are several unsolved problems.One of the
problems is revealing a subclass of PEGs that is equivalent to DFAs. This
allows application of some techniques from the theory of regular grammar to
PEGs. In this paper, we define Linear PEGs (LPEGs), a subclass of PEGs that is
equivalent to DFAs. Surprisingly, LPEGs are formalized by only excluding some
patterns of recursive nonterminal in PEGs, and include the full set of ordered
choice, unlimited lookahead, and greedy repetition, which are characteristic of
PEGs. Although the conversion judgement of parsing expressions into DFAs is
undecidable in general, the formalism of LPEGs allows for a syntactical
judgement of parsing expressions."
"We exhaustively investigate possible combinations of a boolean operation
together with a catenation. In many cases we prove and improve some conjectures
by Brzozowski. For each family of operation, we endeavour to provide a common
witness with a small size alphabet."
"We introduce several classes of array languages obtained by generalising
Angluin's pattern languages to the two-dimensional case. These classes of
two-dimensional pattern languages are compared with respect to their expressive
power and their closure properties are investigated."
"In the present paper, we study the match test for extended regular
expressions. We approach this NP-complete problem by introducing a novel
variant of two-way multihead automata, which reveals that the complexity of the
match test is determined by a hidden combinatorial property of extended regular
expressions, and it shows that a restriction of the corresponding parameter
leads to rich classes with a polynomial time match test. For presentational
reasons, we use the concept of pattern languages in order to specify extended
regular expressions. While this decision, formally, slightly narrows the scope
of our results, an extension of our concepts and results to more general
notions of extended regular expressions is straightforward."
"PAWS is a tool to analyse the behaviour of weighted automata and conditional
transition systems. At its core PAWS is based on a generic implementation of
algorithms for checking language equivalence in weighted automata and
bisimulation in conditional transition systems. This architecture allows for
the use of arbitrary user-defined semirings. New semirings can be generated
during run-time and the user can rely on numerous automatisation techniques to
create new semiring structures for PAWS' algorithms. Basic semirings such as
distributive complete lattices and fields of fractions can be defined by
specifying few parameters, more exotic semirings can be generated from other
semirings or defined from scratch using a built-in semiring generator. In the
most general case, users can define new semirings by programming (in C#) the
base operations of the semiring and a procedure to solve linear equations and
use their newly generated semiring in the analysis tools that PAWS offers."
"In this paper we define a notion of automatic randomness tests (ART) which
capture measure theoretic typicalness of infinite binary sequences within the
framework of automata theory. An individual ART is found to be equivalent to a
deterministic B\""{u}chi automaton recognizing $\omega$-language of (Lebesgue)
measure zero. A collection of ART's induce a notion of automatic random
sequence. We provide a purely combinatorial characterization of an automatic
random sequence in the form of a disjunctive property for sequences."
"Motivated by work on bio-operations on DNA strings, we consider an
outfix-guided insertion operation that can be viewed as a generalization of the
overlap assembly operation on strings studied previously. As the main result we
construct a finite language $L$ such that the outfix-guided insertion closure
of $L$ is non-regular. We consider also the closure properties of regular and
(deterministic) context-free languages under the outfix-guided insertion
operation and decision problems related to outfix-guided insertion. Deciding
whether a language recognized by a deterministic finite automaton is closed
under outfix-guided insertion can be done in polynomial time. The complexity of
the corresponding question for nondeterministic finite automata remains open."
"We present a method for approximating context-free languages with one-counter
automata. This approximation allows the reconstruction of parse trees of the
original grammar. We identify a decidable superset of regular languages whose
elements, i.e. languages, are recognized by one-counter automata."
"We show that some results from the theory of group automata and monoid
automata still hold for more general classes of monoids and models. Extending
previous work for finite automata over commutative groups, we prove that the
context-free language $\mathtt{L_1}^*= \{a^n b^n : n\geq 1\}^* $ can not be
recognized by any rational monoid automaton over a finitely generated
permutable monoid. We show that the class of languages recognized by rational
monoid automata over finitely generated completely simple or completely
0-simple permutable monoids is a semi-linear full trio. Furthermore, we
investigate valence pushdown automata, and prove that they are only as powerful
as (finite) valence automata. We observe that certain results proven for monoid
automata can be easily lifted to the case of context-free valence grammars."
"A deterministic finite-state automaton (FSA) is an abstract sequential
machine that reads the symbols comprising an input word one at a time. An FSA
is symmetric if its output is independent of the order in which the input
symbols are read, i.e., if the output is invariant under permutations of the
input. We show how to convert a symmetric FSA A into an automaton-like
divide-and-conquer process whose intermediate results are no larger than the
size of A's memory. In comparison, a similar result for general FSA's has been
long known via functional composition, but entails an exponential increase in
memory size. The new result has applications to parallel processing and
symmetric FSA networks."
"A new class of languages of infinite words is introduced, called the
max-regular languages, extending the class of $\omega$-regular languages. The
class has two equivalent descriptions: in terms of automata (a type of
deterministic counter automaton), and in terms of logic (weak monadic
second-order logic with a bounding quantifier). Effective translations between
the logic and automata are given."
"The ambiguity of a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) N for input size n
is the maximal number of accepting computations of N for an input of size n.
For all k, r 2 N we construct languages Lr,k which can be recognized by NFA's
with size k poly(r) and ambiguity O(nk), but Lr,k has only NFA's with
exponential size, if ambiguity o(nk) is required. In particular, a hierarchy
for polynomial ambiguity is obtained, solving a long standing open problem
(Ravikumar and Ibarra, 1989, Leung, 1998)."
"The precise complexity of complementing B\""uchi automata is an intriguing and
long standing problem. While optimal complementation techniques for finite
automata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset
construction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton
- B\""uchi complementation is more involved. Indeed, the construction of an
EXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the
introduction of B\""uchi automata in the early 60s, and stepwise narrowing the
gap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent (of (6e)n for
B\""uchi automata with n states) took four decades. While the distance between
the known upper (O'(0.96 n)n') and lower ('(0.76 n)n') bound on the required
number of states has meanwhile been significantly reduced, an exponential
factor remains between them. Also, the upper bound on the size of the
complement automaton is not linear in the bound of its state space. These gaps
are unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view, but also because B\""uchi
complementation is a useful tool in formal verification, in particular for the
language containment problem. This paper proposes a B\""uchi complementation
algorithm whose complexity meets, modulo a quadratic (O(n2)) factor, the known
lower bound for B\""uchi complementation. It thus improves over previous
constructions by an exponential factor and concludes the quest for optimal
B\""uchi complementation algorithms."
"Pseudorandomness has played a central role in modern cryptography, finding
theoretical and practical applications to various fields of computer science. A
function that generates pseudorandom strings from shorter but truly random
seeds is known as a pseudorandom generator. Our generators are designed to fool
languages (or equivalently, Boolean-valued functions). In particular, our
generator fools advised context-free languages, namely, context-free languages
assisted by external information known as advice, and moreover our generator is
made almost one-to-one, stretching $n$-bit seeds to $n+1$ bits. We explicitly
construct such a pseudorandom generator, which is computed by a deterministic
Turing machine using logarithmic space and also belongs to CFLMV(2)/n---a
functional extension of the 2-conjunctive closure of CFL with the help of
appropriate deterministic advice. In contrast, we show that there is no almost
one-to-one pseudorandom generator against context-free languages if we demand
that it should be computed by a nondeterministic pushdown automaton equipped
with a write-only output tape. Our generator naturally extends known
pseudorandom generators against advised regular languages. Our proof of the
CFL/n-pseudorandomness of the generator is quite elementary, and in particular,
one part of the proof utilizes a special feature of the behaviors of
nondeterministic pushdown automata, called a swapping property, which is
interesting in its own right, generalizing the swapping lemma for context-free
languages."
"We prove that, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$, no polynomial algorithm can
approximate the minimum length of \sws for a given \san within a constant
factor."
"A language L over a finite alphabet is growth-sensitive (or entropy
sensitive) if forbidding any set of subwords F yields a sub-language L^F whose
exponential growth rate (entropy) is smaller than that of L. Let (X, E, l) be
an infinite, oriented, labelled graph. Considering the graph as an (infinite)
automaton, we associate with any pair of vertices x,y in X the language
consisting of all words that can be read as the labels along some path from x
to y. Under suitable, general assumptions we prove that these languages are
growth-sensitive. This is based on using Markov chains with forbidden
transitions."
"We investigate the problem of the maximum number of cubic subwords (of the
form $www$) in a given word. We also consider square subwords (of the form
$ww$). The problem of the maximum number of squares in a word is not well
understood. Several new results related to this problem are produced in the
paper. We consider two simple problems related to the maximum number of
subwords which are squares or which are highly repetitive; then we provide a
nontrivial estimation for the number of cubes. We show that the maximum number
of squares $xx$ such that $x$ is not a primitive word (nonprimitive squares) in
a word of length $n$ is exactly $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor - 1$, and the
maximum number of subwords of the form $x^k$, for $k\ge 3$, is exactly $n-2$.
In particular, the maximum number of cubes in a word is not greater than $n-2$
either. Using very technical properties of occurrences of cubes, we improve
this bound significantly. We show that the maximum number of cubes in a word of
length $n$ is between $(1/2)n$ and $(4/5)n$. (In particular, we improve the
lower bound from the conference version of the paper.)"
"We introduce a new fragment of Linear temporal logic (LTL) called LIO and a
new class of Buechi automata (BA) called Almost linear Buechi automata (ALBA).
We provide effective translations between LIO and ALBA showing that the two
formalisms are expressively equivalent. While standard translations of LTL into
BA use some intermediate formalisms, the presented translation of LIO into ALBA
is direct. As we expect applications of ALBA in model checking, we compare the
expressiveness of ALBA with other classes of Buechi automata studied in this
context and we indicate possible applications."
"Repetition avoidance has been studied since Thue's work. In this paper, we
considered another type of repetition, which is called pseudo-power. This
concept is inspired by Watson-Crick complementarity in DNA sequence and is
defined over an antimorphic involution $\phi$. We first classify the alphabet
$\Sigma$ and the antimorphic involution $\phi$, under which there exists
sufficiently long pseudo-$k$th-power-free words. Then we present algorithms to
test whether a finite word $w$ is pseudo-$k$th-power-free."
"Visibly pushdown automata (VPA), introduced by Alur and Madhusuan in 2004, is
a subclass of pushdown automata whose stack behavior is completely determined
by the input symbol according to a fixed partition of the input alphabet. Since
its introduce, VPAs have been shown to be useful in various context, e.g., as
specification formalism for verification and as automaton model for processing
XML streams. Due to high complexity, however, implementation of formal
verification based on VPA framework is a challenge. In this paper we consider
the problem of implementing VPA-based model checking algorithms. For doing so,
we first present an improvement on upper bound for determinization of VPA.
Next, we propose simple on-the-fly algorithms to check universality and
inclusion problems of this automata class. Then, we implement the proposed
algorithms in a prototype tool. Finally, we conduct experiments on randomly
generated VPAs. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are
considerably faster than the standard ones."
"In this article we define a new reducibility based on the enumeration orders
of r.e. sets."
"In this paper, we significantly improve a previous result by the same author
showing the existence of a weakly universal cellular automaton with five states
living in the hyperbolic 3D-space. Here, we get such a cellular automaton with
three states only."
"We present several infinite series of synchronizing automata for which the
minimum length of reset words is close to the square of the number of states.
These automata are closely related to primitive digraphs with large exponent."
"We consider the four fragments FO2, the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2, the
intersection of Pi2 and FO2, and Delta2 of first-order logic FO[<] over finite
and infinite words. For all four fragments, we give characterizations in terms
of rankers. In particular, we generalize the notion of a ranker to infinite
words in two possible ways. Both extensions are natural in the sense that over
finite words, they coincide with classical rankers and over infinite words,
they both have the full expressive power of FO2. Moreover, the first extension
of rankers admits a characterization of the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2
while the other leads to a characterization of the intersection of Pi2 and FO2.
Both versions of rankers yield characterizations of the fragment Delta2. As a
byproduct, we also obtain characterizations based on unambiguous temporal logic
and unambiguous interval temporal logic."
"We prove the Cerny conjecture for one-cluster automata with prime length
cycle. Consequences are given for the hybrid Road-coloring-Cerny conjecture for
digraphs with a proper cycle of prime length."
"Indexed monoidal algebras are introduced as an equivalent structure for
self-dual compact closed categories, and a coherence theorem is proved for the
category of such algebras. Turing automata and Turing graph machines are
defined by generalizing the classical Turing machine concept, so that the
collection of such machines becomes an indexed monoidal algebra. On the analogy
of the von Neumann data-flow computer architecture, Turing graph machines are
proposed as potentially reversible low-level universal computational devices,
and a truly reversible molecular size hardware model is presented as an
example."
"We introduce partially ordered two-way B\""uchi automata and characterize
their expressive power in terms of fragments of first-order logic FO[<].
Partially ordered two-way B\""uchi automata are B\""uchi automata which can
change the direction in which the input is processed with the constraint that
whenever a state is left, it is never re-entered again. Nondeterministic
partially ordered two-way B\""uchi automata coincide with the first-order
fragment Sigma2. Our main contribution is that deterministic partially ordered
two-way B\""uchi automata are expressively complete for the first-order fragment
Delta2. As an intermediate step, we show that deterministic partially ordered
two-way B\""uchi automata are effectively closed under Boolean operations.
  A small model property yields coNP-completeness of the emptiness problem and
the inclusion problem for deterministic partially ordered two-way B\""uchi
automata."
"We present an extension of an algorithm for computing directly the denotation
of a mu-calculus formula X over the configuration graph of a pushdown system to
allow backwards modalities. Our method gives the first extension of the
saturation technique to the full mu-calculus with backwards modalities."
"We study tree languages that can be defined in \Delta_2 . These are tree
languages definable by a first-order formula whose quantifier prefix is forall
exists, and simultaneously by a first-order formula whose quantifier prefix is
. For the quantifier free part we consider two signatures, either the
descendant relation alone or together with the lexicographical order relation
on nodes. We provide an effective characterization of tree and forest languages
definable in \Delta_2 . This characterization is in terms of algebraic
equations. Over words, the class of word languages definable in \Delta_2 forms
a robust class, which was given an effective algebraic characterization by Pin
and Weil."
"We present upper and two-sided bounds of the exponential growth rate for a
wide range of power-free languages. All bounds are obtained with the use of
algorithms previously developed by the author."
"In a previous work we introduced slice graphs as a way to specify both
infinite languages of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and infinite languages of
partial orders. Therein we focused on the study of Hasse diagram generators,
i.e., slice graphs that generate only transitive reduced DAGs, and showed that
they could be used to solve several problems related to the partial order
behavior of p/t-nets. In the present work we show that both slice graphs and
Hasse diagram generators are worth studying on their own. First, we prove that
any slice graph SG can be effectively transformed into a Hasse diagram
generator HG representing the same set of partial orders. Thus from an
algorithmic standpoint we introduce a method of transitive reducing infinite
families of DAGs specified by slice graphs. Second, we identify the class of
saturated slice graphs. By using our transitive reduction algorithm, we prove
that the class of partial order languages representable by saturated slice
graphs is closed under union, intersection and even under a suitable notion of
complementation (cut-width complementation). Furthermore partial order
languages belonging to this class can be tested for inclusion and admit
canonical representatives in terms of Hasse diagram generators. As an
application of our results, we give stronger forms of some results in our
previous work, and establish some unknown connections between the partial order
behavior of $p/t$-nets and other well known formalisms for the specification of
infinite families of partial orders, such as Mazurkiewicz trace languages and
message sequence chart (MSC) languages."
"We consider fragments of first-order logic and as models we allow finite and
infinite words simultaneously. The only binary relations apart from equality
are order comparison < and the successor predicate +1. We give
characterizations of the fragments Sigma2 = Sigma2[<,+1] and FO2 = FO2[<,+1] in
terms of algebraic and topological properties. To this end we introduce the
factor topology over infinite words. It turns out that a language L is in the
intersection of FO2 and Sigma2 if and only if L is the interior of an FO2
language. Symmetrically, a language is in the intersection of FO2 and Pi2 if
and only if it is the topological closure of an FO2 language. The fragment
Delta2, which by definition is the intersection of Sigma2 and Pi2 contains
exactly the clopen languages in FO2. In particular, over infinite words Delta2
is a strict subclass of FO2. Our characterizations yield decidability of the
membership problem for all these fragments over finite and infinite words; and
as a corollary we also obtain decidability for infinite words. Moreover, we
give a new decidable algebraic characterization of dot-depth 3/2 over finite
words. Decidability of dot-depth 3/2 over finite words was first shown by
Gla{\ss}er and Schmitz in STACS 2000, and decidability of the membership
problem for FO2 over infinite words was shown 1998 by Wilke in his habilitation
thesis whereas decidability of Sigma2 over infinite words was not known before."
"We describe a uniform construction for converting $\omega$-automata with
arbitrary acceptance conditions (based on the notion of infinity sets i.e. the
set of states visited infinitely often in a run of the automaton) to equivalent
deterministic parity automata (DPW). Given a non-deterministic automaton with
$n$ states, our construction gives a DPW with at most $2^{O(n^2 \log n)}$
states and $O(n^2)$ parity indices. The corresponding bounds when the original
automaton is deterministic are O(n!) and O(n), respectively. Our algorithm
gives better asymptotic bounds on the number of states and parity indices
vis-a-vis the best known technique when determinizing Rabin or Streett automata
with $\Omega{(2^n)}$ acceptance pairs, where $n > 1$. We demonstrate this by
describing a family of Streett (and Rabin) automata with $2^{n}$ non-redundant
acceptance pairs, for which the best known determinization technique gives a
DPW with at least $\Omega{(2^{(n^3)})}$ states, while our construction
constructs a DRW/DPW with $2^{O(n^2\log n)}$ states. An easy corollary of our
construction is that an $\omega$-language with Rabin index $k$ cannot be
recognized by any $\omega$-automaton (deterministic or non-deterministic) with
fewer than $O(\sqrt{k})$ states."
"Over finite words, languages of dot-depth one are expressively complete for
alternation-free first-order logic. This fragment is also known as the Boolean
closure of existential first-order logic. Here, the atomic formulas comprise
order, successor, minimum, and maximum predicates. Knast (1983) has shown that
it is decidable whether a language has dot-depth one. We extend Knast's result
to infinite words. In particular, we describe the class of languages definable
in alternation-free first-order logic over infinite words, and we give an
effective characterization of this fragment. This characterization has two
components. The first component is identical to Knast's algebraic property for
finite words and the second component is a topological property, namely being a
Boolean combination of Cantor sets.
  As an intermediate step we consider finite and infinite words simultaneously.
We then obtain the results for infinite words as well as for finite words as
special cases. In particular, we give a new proof of Knast's Theorem on
languages of dot-depth one over finite words."
"The hairpin completion is an operation on formal languages which is inspired
by the hairpin formation in biochemistry. Hairpin formations occur naturally
within DNA-computing. It has been known that the hairpin completion of a
regular language is linear context-free, but not regular, in general. However,
for some time it is was open whether the regularity of the hairpin completion
of a regular language is is decidable. In 2009 this decidability problem has
been solved positively by providing a polynomial time algorithm. In this paper
we improve the complexity bound by showing that the decision problem is
actually NL-complete. This complexity bound holds for both, the one-sided and
the two-sided hairpin completions."
"We construct an example of proof within the main formal system from
arXiv:1010.4760v3, which is intended to capture the bisimulation equivalence
for non-deterministic first-order grammars, and show that its conclusion is
semantically false. We then locate and analyze the flawed argument in the
soundness (meta)-proof of the above reference."
"Theory of tree transducers provides a foundation for understanding
expressiveness and complexity of analysis problems for specification languages
for transforming hierarchically structured data such as XML documents. We
introduce streaming tree transducers as an analyzable, executable, and
expressive model for transforming unranked ordered trees in a single pass.
Given a linear encoding of the input tree, the transducer makes a single
left-to-right pass through the input, and computes the output in linear time
using a finite-state control, a visibly pushdown stack, and a finite number of
variables that store output chunks that can be combined using the operations of
string-concatenation and tree-insertion. We prove that the expressiveness of
the model coincides with transductions definable using monadic second-order
logic (MSO). Existing models of tree transducers either cannot implement all
MSO-definable transformations, or require regular look ahead that prohibits
single-pass implementation. We show a variety of analysis problems such as
type-checking and checking functional equivalence are solvable for our model."
"The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over
finite words: given a probabilistic automaton A, are there words accepted by A
with probability arbitrarily close to 1? This problem was proved undecidable
recently. We sharpen this result, showing that the undecidability result holds
even if the probabilistic automata have only one probabilistic transition. Our
main contribution is to introduce a new class of probabilistic automata, called
leaktight automata, for which the value 1 problem is shown decidable (and
PSPACE-complete). We construct an algorithm based on the computation of a
monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton, and rely on algebraic
techniques developed by Simon for the correctness proof. The class of leaktight
automata is decidable in PSPACE, subsumes all subclasses of probabilistic
automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable (in particular
deterministic automata), and is closed under two natural composition operators."
"An automaton is isomorphic to the direct product of a permutation strongly
connected automaton and a synchronizing strongly connected automaton if and
only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) it is strongly connected;
(ii) the minimal ideal of its transition semigroup is a right group and (iii)
the ranges of the idempotent elements of the minimal ideal of its transition
semigroup form a partition on its set of states."
"We prove a Fife-like characterization of the infinite binary (7/3)-power-free
words, by giving a finite automaton of 15 states that encodes all such words.
As a consequence, we characterize all such words that are 2-automatic."
"A weighted finite-state machine with n tapes (n-WFSM) defines a rational
relation on n strings. It is a generalization of weighted acceptors (one tape)
and transducers (two tapes).
  After recalling some basic definitions about n-ary weighted rational
relations and n-WFSMs, we summarize some central operations on these relations
and machines, such as join and auto-intersection. Unfortunately, due to Post's
Correspondence Problem, a fully general join or auto-intersection algorithm
cannot exist. We recall a restricted algorithm for a class of n-WFSMs.
  Through a series of practical applications, we finally investigate the
augmented descriptive power of n-WFSMs and their join, compared to classical
transducers and their composition. Some applications are not feasible with the
latter. The series includes: the morphological analysis of Semitic languages,
the preservation of intermediate results in transducer cascades, the induction
of morphological rules from corpora, the alignment of lexicon entries, the
automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora, and the search
for cognates in a bilingual lexicon.
  All described operations and applications have been implemented with Xerox's
WFSC tool."
"The distinction between safety and liveness properties is a fundamental
classification with immediate implications on the feasibility and complexity of
various monitoring, model checking, and synthesis problems. In this paper, we
revisit the notion of safety for reactive systems, i.e., for systems whose
behavior is characterized by the interplay of uncontrolled environment inputs
and controlled system outputs. We show that reactive safety is a strictly
larger class of properties than standard safety. We provide algorithms for
checking if a property, given as a temporal formula or as a word or tree
automaton, is a reactive safety property and for translating such properties
into safety automata. Based on this construction, the standard verification and
synthesis algorithms for safety properties immediately extend to the larger
class of reactive safety."
"Physical systems can fail. For this reason the problem of identifying and
reacting to faults has received a large attention in the control and computer
science communities. In this paper we study the fault diagnosis problem for
hybrid systems from a game-theoretical point of view. A hybrid system is a
system mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully
modeled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a
formalism including only discrete dynamics. We use the well known framework of
hybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis
Game on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The
environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a
fault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and
announces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy
for the diagnoser implies that faults can be detected correctly, while
computing such a winning strategy corresponds to implement a diagnoser for the
system. We will show how to determine the existence of a winning strategy, and
how to compute it, for some decidable classes of hybrid automata like o-minimal
hybrid automata."
"We show that the problem of whether the fixed point of a morphism avoids
Abelian $k$-powers is decidable under rather general conditions"
"We study the recognition of R-trivial idempotent (R1) languages by various
models of ""decide-and-halt"" quantum finite automata (QFA) and probabilistic
reversible automata (DH-PRA). We introduce bistochastic QFA (MM-BQFA), a model
which generalizes both Nayak's enhanced QFA and DH-PRA. We apply tools from
algebraic automata theory and systems of linear inequalities to give a complete
characterization of R1 languages recognized by all these models. We also find
that ""forbidden constructions"" known so far do not include all of the languages
that cannot be recognized by measure-many QFA."
"In this paper we study $\nu$-CA on one-dimensional lattice defined over a
finite set of local rules. The main goal is to determine how the local rules
can be mixed to ensure the produced $\nu$-CA has some properties. In a first
part, we give some background for the study of $\nu$-CA. Then surjectivity and
injectivity are studied using a variant of DeBruijn graphs. The next part is
dedicated to the number-conserving property."
"We define the notion of circular words, then consider on such words a
constraint derived from the Fibonacci condition. We give several results on the
structure of these circular words, then mention possible applications to
various situations: periodic expansion of numbers in numeration systems,
""gcd-property"" of integer sequences, partition of the prefix of the fixed point
of the Fibonacci substitution, spanning trees of a wheel. Eventually, we
mention some open questions."
"The exponent of a word is the ratio of its length over its smallest period.
The repetitive threshold r(a) of an a-letter alphabet is the smallest rational
number for which there exists an infinite word whose finite factors have
exponent at most r(a). This notion was introduced in 1972 by Dejean who gave
the exact values of r(a) for every alphabet size a as it has been eventually
proved in 2009.
  The finite-repetition threshold for an a-letter alphabet refines the above
notion. It is the smallest rational number FRt(a) for which there exists an
infinite word whose finite factors have exponent at most FRt(a) and that
contains a finite number of factors with exponent r(a). It is known from
Shallit (2008) that FRt(2)=7/3.
  With each finite-repetition threshold is associated the smallest number of
r(a)-exponent factors that can be found in the corresponding infinite word. It
has been proved by Badkobeh and Crochemore (2010) that this number is 12 for
infinite binary words whose maximal exponent is 7/3.
  We show that FRt(3)=r(3)=7/4 and that the bound is achieved with an infinite
word containing only two 7/4-exponent words, the smallest number.
  Based on deep experiments we conjecture that FRt(4)=r(4)=7/5. The question
remains open for alphabets with more than four letters.
  Keywords: combinatorics on words, repetition, repeat, word powers, word
exponent, repetition threshold, pattern avoidability, word morphisms."
"We consider the following problem. Let us fix a finite alphabet A; for any
given d-uple of letter frequencies, how to construct an infinite word u over
the alphabet A satisfying the following conditions: u has linear complexity
function, u is uniformly balanced, the letter frequencies in u are given by the
given d-uple. This paper investigates a construction method for such words
based on the use of mixed multidimensional continued fraction algorithms."
"In recent years codes that are not Uniquely Decipherable (UD) are been
studied partitioning them in classes that localize the ambiguities of the code.
A natural question is how we can extend the notion of maximality to codes that
are not UD. In this paper we give an answer to this question. To do this we
introduce a partial order in the set of submonoids of a monoid showing the
existence, in this poset, of maximal elements that we call full monoids. Then a
set of generators of a full monoid is, by definition, a maximal code. We show
how this definition extends, in a natural way, the existing definition
concerning UD codes and we find a characteristic property of a monoid generated
by a maximal UD code."
"We compute two invariants of topological conjugacy, the upper and lower
limits of the inverse of Boshernitzan's ne_n, where e_n is the smallest measure
of a cylinder of length n, for three families of symbolic systems, the natural
codings of rotations and three-interval exchanges and the Arnoux-Rauzy systems.
The sets of values of these invariants for a given family of systems generalize
the Lagrange spectrum, which is what we get for the family of rotations with
the upper limit of 1/ne_n."
"Trapezoidal words are finite words having at most n+1 distinct factors of
length n, for every n>=0. They encompass finite Sturmian words. We distinguish
trapezoidal words into two disjoint subsets: open and closed trapezoidal words.
A trapezoidal word is closed if its longest repeated prefix has exactly two
occurrences in the word, the second one being a suffix of the word. Otherwise
it is open. We show that open trapezoidal words are all primitive and that
closed trapezoidal words are all Sturmian. We then show that trapezoidal
palindromes are closed (and therefore Sturmian). This allows us to characterize
the special factors of Sturmian palindromes. We end with several open problems."
"We give a new proof for the decidability of the D0L ultimate periodicity
problem based on the decidability of p-periodicity of morphic words adapted to
the approach of Harju and Linna."
"A morphism h is unambiguous with respect to a word w if there is no other
morphism g that maps w to the same image as h. In the present paper we study
the question of whether, for any given word, there exists an unambiguous
1-uniform morphism, i.e., a morphism that maps every letter in the word to an
image of length 1."
"The (-\beta)-integers are natural generalisations of the \beta-integers, and
thus of the integers, for negative real bases. They can be described by
infinite words which are fixed points of anti-morphisms. We show that they are
not necessarily uniformly discrete and relatively dense in the real numbers."
"Probabilistic B\""uchi Automata (PBA) are randomized, finite state automata
that process input strings of infinite length. Based on the threshold chosen
for the acceptance probability, different classes of languages can be defined.
In this paper, we present a number of results that clarify the power of such
machines and properties of the languages they define. The broad themes we focus
on are as follows. We present results on the decidability and precise
complexity of the emptiness, universality and language containment problems for
such machines, thus answering questions central to the use of these models in
formal verification. Next, we characterize the languages recognized by PBAs
topologically, demonstrating that though general PBAs can recognize languages
that are not regular, topologically the languages are as simple as
\omega-regular languages. Finally, we introduce Hierarchical PBAs, which are
syntactically restricted forms of PBAs that are tractable and capture exactly
the class of \omega-regular languages."
"We determine the asymptotic proportion of minimal automata, within n-state
accessible deterministic complete automata over a k-letter alphabet, with the
uniform distribution over the possible transition structures, and a binomial
distribution over terminal states, with arbitrary parameter b. It turns out
that a fraction ~ 1-C(k,b) n^{-k+2} of automata is minimal, with C(k,b) a
function, explicitly determined, involving the solution of a transcendental
equation."
"We introduce an automata model for data words, that is words that carry at
each position a symbol from a finite alphabet and a value from an unbounded
data domain. The model is (semantically) a restriction of data automata,
introduced by Bojanczyk, et. al. in 2006, therefore it is called weak data
automata. It is strictly less expressive than data automata and the expressive
power is incomparable with register automata. The expressive power of weak data
automata corresponds exactly to existential monadic second order logic with
successor +1 and data value equality \sim, EMSO2(+1,\sim). It follows from
previous work, David, et. al. in 2010, that the nonemptiness problem for weak
data automata can be decided in 2-NEXPTIME. Furthermore, we study weak B\""uchi
automata on data omega-strings. They can be characterized by the extension of
EMSO2(+1,\sim) with existential quantifiers for infinite sets. Finally, the
same complexity bound for its nonemptiness problem is established by a
nondeterministic polynomial time reduction to the nonemptiness problem of weak
data automata."
"The question of the state-size cost for simulation of two-way
nondeterministic automata (2NFAs) by two-way deterministic automata (2DFAs) was
raised in 1978 and, despite many attempts, it is still open. Subsequently, the
problem was attacked by restricting the power of 2DFAs (e.g., using a
restricted input head movement) to the degree for which it was already possible
to derive some exponential gaps between the weaker model and the standard
2NFAs. Here we use an opposite approach, increasing the power of 2DFAs to the
degree for which it is still possible to obtain a subexponential conversion
from the stronger model to the standard 2DFAs. In particular, it turns out that
subexponential conversion is possible for two-way automata that make
nondeterministic choices only when the input head scans one of the input tape
endmarkers. However, there is no restriction on the input head movement. This
implies that an exponential gap between 2NFAs and 2DFAs can be obtained only
for unrestricted 2NFAs using capabilities beyond the proposed new model. As an
additional bonus, conversion into a machine for the complement of the original
language is polynomial in this model. The same holds for making such machines
self-verifying, halting, or unambiguous. Finally, any superpolynomial lower
bound for the simulation of such machines by standard 2DFAs would imply L<>NL.
In the same way, the alternating version of these machines is related to L =?
NL =? P, the classical computational complexity problems."
"Let D denote an infinite alphabet -- a set that consists of infinitely many
symbols. A word w = a_0 b_0 a_1 b_1 ... a_n b_n of even length over D can be
viewed as a directed graph G_w whose vertices are the symbols that appear in w,
and the edges are (a_0,b_0),(a_1,b_1),...,(a_n,b_n). For a positive integer m,
define a language R_m such that a word w = a_0 b_0 ... a_n b_n is in R_m if and
only if there is a path in the graph G_w of length <= m from the vertex a_0 to
the vertex b_n.
  We establish the following hierarchy theorem for pebble automata over
infinite alphabet. For every positive integer k, (i) there exists a k-pebble
automaton that accepts the language R_{2^k-1}; (ii) there is no k-pebble
automaton that accepts the language R_{2^{k+1} - 2}. Based on this result, we
establish a number of previously unknown relations among some classes of
languages over infinite alphabets."
"This work aims at further investigations on the work of Giambruno and Restivo
to find the rank of the intersection of two finitely generated submonoids of a
free monoid. In this connection, we obtain the rank of a finitely generated
submonoid of a free monoid that is accepted by semi-flower automaton with two
bpi's. Further, when the product automaton of two deterministic semi-flower
automata with a unique bpi is semi-flower with two bpi's, we obtain a
sufficient condition on the product automaton in order to satisfy the Hanna
Neumann property."
"In the paper we develop the $p$-adic theory of discrete automata. Every
automaton $\mathfrak A$ (transducer) whose input/output alphabets consist of
$p$ symbols can be associated to a continuous (in fact, 1-Lipschitz) map from
$p$-adic integers to $p$ integers, the automaton function $f_\mathfrak A$. The
$p$-adic theory (in particular, the $p$-adic ergodic theory) turned out to be
very efficient in a study of properties of automata expressed via properties of
automata functions. In the paper we prove a criterion for finiteness of the
number of states of automaton in terms of van der Put series of the automaton
function. The criterion displays connections between $p$-adic analysis and the
theory of automata sequences."
"We introduce improvements in the algorithm by Gastin and Oddoux translating
LTL formulae into B\""uchi automata via very weak alternating co-B\""uchi
automata and generalized B\""uchi automata. Several improvements are based on
specific properties of any formula where each branch of its syntax tree
contains at least one eventually operator and at least one always operator.
These changes usually result in faster translations and smaller automata. Other
improvements reduce non-determinism in the produced automata. In fact, we
modified all the steps of the original algorithm and its implementation known
as LTL2BA. Experimental results show that our modifications are real
improvements. Their implementations within an LTL2BA translation made LTL2BA
very competitive with the current version of SPOT, sometimes outperforming it
substantially."
"This paper shows that a finitely presented monoid with linear Dehn function
need not have a regular cross-section, strengthening the previously-known
result that such a monoid need not be presented by a finite complete string
rewriting system, and contrasting the fact that finitely presented groups with
linear Dehn function always have regular cross-sections."
"""How much c.e. sets could cover a given set?"" in this paper we are going to
answer this question. Also, in this approach some old concepts come into a new
arrangement. The major goal of this article is to introduce an appropriate
definition for this purpose. Introduction In Computability Theory (Recursion
Theory) in the first step we wish to recognize the sets which could be
enumerated by Turing machines (equivalently, algorithms) and in the next step
we will compare these sets by some reasonable order (Like Turing degree). Also
sometimes with some extra information (Oracles) a class of non c.e. sets show
the same behavior as c.e. sets (Post hierarchy and related theorems). Here we
try another approach: ""Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to recognize how
much this set might be covered by a c.e. set?"" Although in some sense this
approach could be seen in some definitions of Recursion Theory, but at the best
of our knowledge it didn't considered as an approach yet, even though it is
able to shed a light on some subjects of Computability of sets. Defining this
approach is not quite straightforward and there are some obstacles to define
them. To overcome these difficulties we modify the definitions. We have an
alternative problem here when we consider recursive sets and not c.e. sets. In
this case, the problem would be: ""Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to know
that how much this set might be covered by a recursive Set?"" Here, we try the
first definition and the first problem."
"Trapezoidal words are words having at most $n+1$ distinct factors of length
$n$ for every $n\ge 0$. They therefore encompass finite Sturmian words. We give
combinatorial characterizations of trapezoidal words and exhibit a formula for
their enumeration. We then separate trapezoidal words into two disjoint
classes: open and closed. A trapezoidal word is closed if it has a factor that
occurs only as a prefix and as a suffix; otherwise it is open. We investigate
open and closed trapezoidal words, in relation with their special factors. We
prove that Sturmian palindromes are closed trapezoidal words and that a closed
trapezoidal word is a Sturmian palindrome if and only if its longest repeated
prefix is a palindrome. We also define a new class of words, \emph{semicentral
words}, and show that they are characterized by the property that they can be
written as $uxyu$, for a central word $u$ and two different letters $x,y$.
Finally, we investigate the prefixes of the Fibonacci word with respect to the
property of being open or closed trapezoidal words, and show that the sequence
of open and closed prefixes of the Fibonacci word follows the Fibonacci
sequence."
"Tree Regular Model Checking (TRMC) is the name of a family of techniques for
analyzing infinite-state systems in which states are represented by terms, and
sets of states by Tree Automata (TA). The central problem in TRMC is to decide
whether a set of bad states is reachable. The problem of computing a TA
representing (an over- approximation of) the set of reachable states is
undecidable, but efficient solutions based on completion or iteration of tree
transducers exist. Unfortunately, the TRMC framework is unable to efficiently
capture both the complex structure of a system and of some of its features. As
an example, for JAVA programs, the structure of a term is mainly exploited to
capture the structure of a state of the system. On the counter part, integers
of the java programs have to be encoded with Peano numbers, which means that
any algebraic operation is potentially represented by thousands of applications
of rewriting rules. In this paper, we propose Lattice Tree Automata (LTAs), an
extended version of tree automata whose leaves are equipped with lattices. LTAs
allow us to represent possibly infinite sets of interpreted terms. Such terms
are capable to represent complex domains and related operations in an efficient
manner. We also extend classical Boolean operations to LTAs. Finally, as a
major contribution, we introduce a new completion-based algorithm for computing
the possibly infinite set of reachable interpreted terms in a finite amount of
time."
"In this paper we present a new fast algorithm finding minimal reset words for
finite synchronizing automata. The problem is know to be computationally hard,
and our algorithm is exponential. Yet, it is faster than the algorithms used so
far and it works well in practice. The main idea is to use a bidirectional BFS
and radix (Patricia) tries to store and compare resulted subsets. We give both
theoretical and practical arguments showing that the branching factor is
reduced efficiently. As a practical test we perform an experimental study of
the length of the shortest reset word for random automata with $n$ states and 2
input letters. We follow Skvorsov and Tipikin, who have performed such a study
using a SAT solver and considering automata up to $n=100$ states. With our
algorithm we are able to consider much larger sample of automata with up to
$n=300$ states. In particular, we obtain a new more precise estimation of the
expected length of the shortest reset word $\approx 2.5\sqrt{n-5}$."
"In this paper we present an application of a simple technique of local
recompression, previously developed by the author in the context of compressed
membership problems and compressed pattern matching, to word equations. The
technique is based on local modification of variables (replacing X by aX or Xa)
and iterative replacement of pairs of letters appearing in the equation by a
`fresh' letter, which can be seen as a bottom-up compression of the solution of
the given word equation, to be more specific, building an SLP (Straight-Line
Programme) for the solution of the word equation.
  Using this technique we give a new, independent and self-contained proofs of
most of the known results for word equations. To be more specific, the
presented (nondeterministic) algorithm runs in O(n log n) space and in time
polynomial in log N, where N is the size of the length-minimal solution of the
word equation. The presented algorithm can be easily generalised to a generator
of all solutions of the given word equation (without increasing the space
usage). Furthermore, a further analysis of the algorithm yields a doubly
exponential upper bound on the size of the length-minimal solution. The
presented algorithm does not use exponential bound on the exponent of
periodicity. Conversely, the analysis of the algorithm yields an independent
proof of the exponential bound on exponent of periodicity.
  We believe that the presented algorithm, its idea and analysis are far
simpler than all previously applied. Furthermore, thanks to it we can obtain a
unified and simple approach to most of known results for word equations.
  As a small additional result we show that for O(1) variables (with arbitrary
many appearances in the equation) word equations can be solved in linear space,
i.e. they are context-sensitive."
"We describe a technique for mechanically proving certain kinds of theorems in
combinatorics on words, using automata and a package for manipulating them. We
illustrate our technique by solving, purely mechanically, an open problem of
Currie and Saari on the lengths of unbordered factors in the Thue-Morse
sequence."
"We consider the task of controlling in a distributed way a Zielonka
asynchronous automaton. Every process of a controller has access to its causal
past to determine the next set of actions it proposes to play. An action can be
played only if every process controlling this action proposes to play it. We
consider reachability objectives: every process should reach its set of final
states. We show that this control problem is decidable for tree architectures,
where every process can communicate with its parent, its children, and with the
environment. The complexity of our algorithm is l-fold exponential with l being
the height of the tree representing the architecture. We show that this is
unavoidable by showing that even for three processes the problem is
EXPTIME-complete, and that it is non-elementary in general."
"Numerous computer systems use dynamic control and data structures of
unbounded size. These data structures have often the character of trees or they
can be encoded as trees with some additional pointers. This is exploited by
some currently intensively studied techniques of formal verification that
represent an infinite number of states using a finite tree automaton. However,
currently there is no tree automata library implementation that would provide
an efficient and flexible support for such methods. Thus the aim of this
Master's Thesis is to provide such a library. The present paper first describes
the theoretical background of finite tree automata and regular tree languages.
Then it surveys the current implementations of tree automata libraries and
studies various verification techniques, outlining requirements for the
library. Representation of a finite tree automaton and algorithms that perform
standard language operations on this representation are proposed in the next
part, which is followed by description of library implementation. Through a
series of experiments it is shown that the library can compete with other
available tree automata libraries, in certain areas being even significantly
superior to them."
"Floyd languages (FL), alias Operator Precedence Languages, have recently
received renewed attention thanks to their closure properties and local
parsability which allow one to apply automatic verification techniques (e.g.
model checking) and parallel and incremental parsing. They properly include
various other classes, noticeably Visual Pushdown languages. In this paper we
provide a characterization of FL in terms a monadic second order logic (MSO),
in the same style as Buchi's one for regular languages. We prove the
equivalence between automata recognizing FL and the MSO formalization."
"In this chapter we discuss the problem of enumerating distinct regular
expressions by size and the regular languages they represent. We discuss
various notions of the size of a regular expression that appear in the
literature and their advantages and disadvantages. We consider a formal
definition of regular expressions using a context-free grammar.
  We then show how to enumerate strings generated by an unambiguous
context-free grammar using the Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger theorem. This theorem
allows one to construct an algebraic equation whose power series expansion
provides the enumeration. Classical tools from complex analysis, such as
singularity analysis, can then be used to determine the asymptotic behavior of
the enumeration.
  We use these algebraic and analytic methods to obtain asymptotic estimates on
the number of regular expressions of size n. A single regular language can
often be described by several regular expressions, and we estimate the number
of distinct languages denoted by regular expressions of size n. We also give
asymptotic estimates for these quantities. For the first few values, we provide
exact enumeration results."
"We survey facts mostly emerging from the seminal results of Alan Cobham
obtained in the late sixties and early seventies. We do not attempt to be
exhaustive but try instead to give some personal interpretations and some
research directions. We discuss the notion of numeration systems, recognizable
sets of integers and automatic sequences. We briefly sketch some results about
transcendence related to the representation of real numbers. We conclude with
some applications to combinatorial game theory and verification of
infinite-state systems and present a list of open problems."
"In the literature, there exist several quantum finite automata (QFA) models
with both quantum and classical states. These models are of particular
interest,as they show praiseworthy advantages over the fully quantum models in
some nontrivial aspects. This paper characterizes these models in a uniform
framework by proposing a general hybrid model consisting of a quantum component
and a classical one which can interact with each other. The existing hybrid QFA
can be naturally regarded as the general model with specific communication
patterns (classical-quantum, quantum-classical, and two-way, respectively). We
further clarify the relationship between these hybrid QFA and some other
quantum models. In particular, it is shown that hybrid QFA can be simulated
exactly by QFA with quantum operations, which in turn has a close relationship
with two early proposed models: {\it ancialla QFA} and {\it quantum sequential
machines}."
"In this work, we design the game semantics for timed equivalences and
preorders of timed processes. The timed games corresponding to the various
timed relations form a hierarchy. These games are similar to Stirling's
bisimulation games. If it is the case that the existence of a winning strategy
for the defender in a game ${\cal G}_1$ implies that there exists a winning
strategy for the defender in another game ${\cal G}_2$, then the relation that
corresponds to ${\cal G}_1$ is stronger than the relation corresponding to
${\cal G}_2$. The game hierarchy also throws light into several timed relations
that are not considered in this paper."
"Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to understand and analyze in
order to assert their correction w.r.t. given properties. They often exhibit a
huge number of different behaviors, as soon as the active entities (peers,
agents, processes, etc) behave in an asynchronous manner. Already the
modelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal
verification.
  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring
on a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions,
called asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime
verification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or
very complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible.
Therefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property
on the underlying system at runtime.
  We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as
asynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the
same kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring.
A distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we
propose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows
that if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of
infinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable
unions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable. We also
show that over infinite traces, recognizable countable unions of locally safety
languages are precisely the complements of deterministic languages."
"This volume contains the proceedings of the 18th International workshop
AUTOMATA and the 3rd international symposium JAC.
  AUTOMATA workshop series aims at gathering researchers from all over the
world working in fundamental aspects of cellular automata and related discrete
complex systems. Topics cover (although they are not limited to): dynamics,
topological, ergodic and algebraic aspects, algorithmic and complexity issues,
emergent properties, formal language processing, symbolic dynamics, models of
parallelism and distributed systems, phenomenological descriptions, scientific
modeling and practical applications. JAC (Journ\'ees Automates Cellulaires) is
a bi-annual symposium covering the same topics and was created to have a very
high standard international conference in the domain. This one will be the
third event of the series after Uz\`es (2008, France), Turku (2010, Finland)."
"The notion of two-way automata was introduced at the very beginning of
automata theory. In 1959, Rabin and Scott and, independently, Shepherdson,
proved that these models, both in the deterministic and in the nondeterministic
versions, have the same power of one-way automata, namely, they characterize
the class of regular languages.
  In 1978, Sakoda and Sipser posed the question of the cost, in the number of
the states, of the simulation of one-way and two-way nondeterministic automata
by two-way deterministic automata. They conjectured that these costs are
exponential. In spite of all attempts to solve it, this question is still open.
  In the last ten years the problem of Sakoda and Sipser was widely
reconsidered and many new results related to it have been obtained. In this
work we discuss some of them. In particular, we focus on the restriction to the
unary case and on the connections with open questions in space complexity."
"Deciding if a given set of Wang tiles admits a tiling of the plane is
decidable if the number of Wang tiles (or the number of colors) is bounded, for
a trivial reason, as there are only finitely many such tilesets. We prove
however that the tiling problem remains undecidable if the difference between
the number of tiles and the number of colors is bounded by 43.
  One of the main new tool is the concept of Wang bars, which are equivalently
inflated Wang tiles or thin polyominoes."
"We introduce the branching transitive closure operator on weighted monadic
second-order logic formulas where the branching corresponds in a natural way to
the branching inherent in trees. For arbitrary commutative semirings, we prove
that weighted monadic second order logics on trees is equivalent to the
definability by formulas which start with one of the following operators: (i) a
branching transitive closure or (ii) an existential second-order quantifier
followed by one universal first-order quantifier; in both cases the operator is
applied to step-formulas over (a) Boolean first-order logic enriched by modulo
counting or (b) Boolean monadic-second order logic."
"We prove that a semigroup generated by a reversible two-state Mealy automaton
is either finite or free of rank 2. This fact leads to the decidability of
finiteness for groups generated by two-state or two-letter
invertible-reversible Mealy automata and to the decidability of freeness for
semigroups generated by two-state invertible-reversible Mealy automata."
"Given a string $P$ of length $m$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ of size $\sigma$,
a swapped version of $P$ is a string derived from $P$ by a series of local
swaps, i.e., swaps of adjacent symbols, such that each symbol can participate
in at most one swap. We present a theoretical analysis of the nondeterministic
finite automaton for the language $\bigcup_{P'\in\Pi_P}\Sigma^*P'$ (swap
automaton for short), where $\Pi_P$ is the set of swapped versions of $P$. Our
study is based on the bit-parallel simulation of the same automaton due to
Fredriksson, and reveals an interesting combinatorial property that links the
automaton to the one for the language $\Sigma^*P$. By exploiting this property
and the method presented by Cantone et al. (2010), we obtain a bit-parallel
encoding of the swap automaton which takes $O(\sigma^2\ceil{k/w})$ space and
allows one to simulate the automaton on a string of length $n$ in time
$O(n\ceil{k/w})$, where $\ceil{m/\sigma}\le k\le m$."
"With the purpose of unifying a number of approaches to energy problems found
in the literature, we introduce generalized energy automata. These are finite
automata whose edges are labeled with energy functions that define how energy
levels evolve during transitions. Uncovering a close connection between energy
problems and reachability and B\""uchi acceptance for semiring-weighted
automata, we show that these generalized energy problems are decidable. We also
provide complexity results for important special cases."
"Some of the most interesting and important results concerning quantum finite
automata are those showing that they can recognize certain languages with
(much) less resources than corresponding classical finite automata
\cite{Amb98,Amb09,AmYa11,Ber05,Fre09,Mer00,Mer01,Mer02,Yak10,ZhgQiu112,Zhg12}.
This paper shows three results of such a type that are stronger in some sense
than other ones because (a) they deal with models of quantum automata with very
little quantumness (so-called semi-quantum one- and two-way automata with one
qubit memory only); (b) differences, even comparing with probabilistic
classical automata, are bigger than expected; (c) a trade-off between the
number of classical and quantum basis states needed is demonstrated in one case
and (d) languages (or the promise problem) used to show main results are very
simple and often explored ones in automata theory or in communication
complexity, with seemingly little structure that could be utilized."
"In this paper we present a unifying approach for deciding various
bisimulations, simulation equivalences and preorders between two timed automata
states. We propose a zone based method for deciding these relations in which we
eliminate an explicit product construction of the region graphs or the zone
graphs as in the classical methods. Our method is also generic and can be used
to decide several timed relations. We also present a game characterization for
these timed relations and show that the game hierarchy reflects the hierarchy
of the timed relations. One can obtain an infinite game hierarchy and thus the
game characterization further indicates the possibility of defining new timed
relations which have not been studied yet. The game characterization also helps
us to come up with a formula which encodes the separation between two states
that are not timed bisimilar. Such distinguishing formulae can also be
generated for many relations other than timed bisimilarity."
"We give a natural complete infinitary axiomatization of the equational theory
of the context-free languages, answering a question of Lei{\ss} (1992)."
"This volume contains the papers presented at the 6th conference on Machines,
Computations and Universality (MCU 2013). MCU 2013 was held in Zurich,
Switzerland, September 9-11, 2013. The MCU series began in Paris in 1995 and
has since been concerned with gaining a deeper understanding of computation
through the study of models of general purpose computation. This volume
continues in this tradition and includes new simple universal models of
computation, and other results that clarify the relationships between models."
"This paper has the goals (1) of unifying top-down parsing with shift-reduce
parsing to yield a single simple and consistent framework, and (2) of producing
provably correct parsing methods, deterministic as well as tabular ones, for
extended context-free grammars (EBNF) represented as state-transition networks.
Departing from the traditional way of presenting as independent algorithms the
deterministic bottom-up LR(1), the top-down LL(1) and the general tabular
(Earley) parsers, we unify them in a coherent minimalist framework. We present
a simple general construction method for EBNF ELR(1) parsers, where the new
category of convergence conflicts is added to the classical shift-reduce and
reduce-reduce conflicts; we prove its correctness and show two implementations
by deterministic push-down machines and by vector-stack machines, the latter to
be also used for Earley parsers. Then the Beatty's theoretical characterization
of LL(1) grammars is adapted to derive the extended ELL(1 parsing method, first
by minimizing the ELR(1) parser and then by simplifying its state information.
Through using the same notations in the ELR(1) case, the extended Earley parser
is obtained. Since all the parsers operate on compatible representations, it is
feasible to combine them into mixed mode algorithms."
"We generalize the construction of multitildes in the aim to provide
multitilde operators for regular languages. We show that the underliying
algebraic structure involves the action of some operads. An operad is an
algebraic structure that mimics the composition of the functions. The involved
operads are described in terms of combinatorial objects. These operads are
obtained from more primitive objects, namely precompositions, whose algebraic
counter-parts are investigated. One of these operads acts faithfully on
languages in the sense that two different operators act in two different ways."
"The class of Unambiguous Star-Free Regular Languages (UL) was defined by
Schutzenberger as the class of languages defined by Unambiguous Polynomials. UL
has been variously characterized (over finite words) by logics such as
TL[X_a,Y_a], UITL, TL[F,P], FO2[<], the variety DA of monoids, as well as
partially-ordered two-way DFA (po2DFA). We revisit this language class with
emphasis on notion of unambiguity and develop on the concept of Deterministic
Logics for UL. The formulas of deterministic logics uniquely parse a word in
order to evaluate satisfaction. We show that several deterministic logics
robustly characterize UL. Moreover, we derive constructive reductions from
these logics to the po2DFA automata. These reductions also allow us to show
NP-complete satisfaction complexity for the deterministic logics considered.
  Logics such as TL[F,P], FO2[<] are not deterministic and have been shown to
characterize UL using algebraic methods. However there has been no known
constructive reduction from these logics to po2DFA. We use deterministic logics
to bridge this gap. The language-equivalent po2DFA for a given TL[F,P] formula
is constructed and we analyze its size relative to the size of the TL[F,P]
formula. This is an efficient reduction which gives an alternate proof to
NP-complete satisfiability complexity of TL[F,P] formulas."
"Synthesis techniques take realizable Linear Temporal Logic specifications and
produce correct cir- cuits that implement the specifications. The generated
circuits can be used directly, or as miters that check the correctness of a
logic design. Typically, those techniques generate non-deterministic finite
state automata, which can be determinized at a possibly exponential cost.
Recent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in
symbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties. In this paper, we
present a technique with a supporting tool that takes a sequential extended
regular expression specification {\Phi}, and a logic design implementation S,
and generates a sequential circuit C, expressed as an And-Inverted-Graph, that
checks whether S satisfies {\Phi}. The technique passes the generated circuit C
to ABC, a bounded model checker, to validate correctness. We use free input
variables to encode the non- determinism in {\Phi} and we obtain a number of
states in miter linear in the size of {\Phi}. Our technique succeeds to
generate the input to the model checker while other techniques fail because of
the exponential blowup, and in most cases, ABC succeeds to either find defects
in the design that was otherwise uncheckable, or validate the design. We
evaluated our technique against several industrial benchmarks including the IBM
arbiter, a load balancer, and a traffic light system, and compared our results
with the NuSMV framework. Our method found defects and validated systems NuSMV
could not validate."
"A discounted-sum automaton (NDA) is a nondeterministic finite automaton with
edge weights, valuing a run by the discounted sum of visited edge weights. More
precisely, the weight in the i-th position of the run is divided by
$\lambda^i$, where the discount factor $\lambda$ is a fixed rational number
greater than 1. The value of a word is the minimal value of the automaton runs
on it. Discounted summation is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially
for infinite sequences, reflecting the assumption that earlier weights are more
important than later weights. Unfortunately, determinization of NDAs, which is
often essential in formal verification, is, in general, not possible. We
provide positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral discount factor
is determinizable. We complete the picture by proving that the integers
characterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee determinizability: for
every nonintegral rational discount factor $\lambda$, there is a
nondeterminizable $\lambda$-NDA. We also prove that the class of NDAs with
integral discount factors enjoys closure under the algebraic operations min,
max, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general NDAs nor for
deterministic NDAs. For general NDAs, we look into approximate determinization,
which is always possible as the influence of a word's suffix decays. We show
that the naive approach, of unfolding the automaton computations up to a
sufficient level, is doubly exponential in the discount factor. We provide an
alternative construction for approximate determinization, which is singly
exponential in the discount factor, in the precision, and in the number of
states. We also prove matching lower bounds, showing that the exponential
dependency on each of these three parameters cannot be avoided. All our results
hold equally for automata over finite words and for automata over infinite
words."
"Buchi's theorem, in establishing the equivalence between languages definable
in S1S over element and < and the omega-regular languages also demonstrated
that S1S over element and < is no more expressive than its existential
fragment. It is also easy to see that S1S over element and < is equi-expressive
with S1S over element and successor. However, it is not immediately obvious
whether it is possible to adapt Buchi's argument to establish equivalence
between expressivity in S1S over element and successor and its existential
fragment. In this paper we show that it is not: the existential fragment of S1S
over element and successor is strictly less expressive, and is in fact
equivalent to the co-Buchi languages."
"Automata operating on general graphs have been introduced by virtue of
graphoids. In this paper we construct a graph automaton that recognizes
$k$-colorable graphs."
"Parity word automata and their determinisation play an important role in
automata and game theory. We discuss a determinisation procedure for
nondeterministic parity automata through deterministic Rabin to deterministic
parity automata. We prove that the intermediate determinisation to Rabin
automata is optimal. We show that the resulting determinisation to parity
automata is optimal up to a small constant. Moreover, the lower bound refers to
the more liberal Streett acceptance. We thus show that determinisation to
Streett would not lead to better bounds than determinisation to parity. As a
side-result, this optimality extends to the determinisation of B\""uchi
automata."
"In this paper we consider the time and the crossing sequence complexities of
one-tape off-line Turing machines. We show that the running time of each
nondeterministic machine accepting a nonregular language must grow at least as
n\log n, in the case all accepting computations are considered (accept
measure). We also prove that the maximal length of the crossing sequences used
in accepting computations must grow at least as \log n. On the other hand, it
is known that if the time is measured considering, for each accepted string,
only the faster accepting computation (weak measure), then there exist
nonregular languages accepted in linear time. We prove that under this measure,
each accepting computation should exhibit a crossing sequence of length at
least \log\log n. We also present efficient implementations of algorithms
accepting some unary nonregular languages."
"We give an effective characterization of the lexicographically least word in
the orbit closure of the Rudin-Shapiro word w having a specified prefix. In
particular, the lexicographically least word in the orbit closure of the
Rudin-Shapiro word is 0w. This answers a question Allouche et al."
"We give topological and algebraic characterizations as well as language
theoretic descriptions of the following subclasses of first-order logic FO[<]
for omega-languages: Sigma_2, FO^2, the intersection of FO^2 and Sigma_2, and
Delta_2 (and by duality Pi_2 and the intersection of FO^2 and Pi_2). These
descriptions extend the respective results for finite words. In particular, we
relate the above fragments to language classes of certain (unambiguous)
polynomials. An immediate consequence is the decidability of the membership
problem of these classes, but this was shown before by Wilke and Bojanczyk and
is therefore not our main focus. The paper is about the interplay of algebraic,
topological, and language theoretic properties."
"In this work a collective of interacting stateless automata in a discrete
geometric environment is considered as an integral automata-like computational
dynamic object. For such distributed on the environment object different
approaches to definition of the measure of state transition are possible. We
propose a geometric approach for defining what a state is."
"We discuss the power and limitation of various ""advice,"" when it is given
particularly to weak computational models of one-tape linear-time Turing
machines and one-way finite (state) automata. Of various advice types, we
consider deterministically-chosen advice (not necessarily algorithmically
determined) and randomly-chosen advice (according to certain probability
distributions). In particular, we show that certain weak machines can be
significantly enhanced in computational power when randomized advice is
provided in place of deterministic advice."
"Currently there is great interest in computational models consisting of
underlying regular computational environments, and built on them distributed
computational structures. Examples of such models are cellular automata,
spatial computation and space-time crystallography. For any computational model
it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related
computational structures. In the finite automata theory an example of such
equivalence is automata homomorphism and, in particular, automata isomorphism.
If we continue to stick to the finite automata theory, a fundamental question
arise, what a state of a distributed computational structure is. This work is
devoted to particular solution of the issue."
"It is known that an ordinal is the order type of the lexicographic ordering
of a regular language if and only if it is less than omega^omega. We design a
polynomial time algorithm that constructs, for each well-ordered regular
language L with respect to the lexicographic ordering, given by a deterministic
finite automaton, the Cantor Normal Form of its order type. It follows that
there is a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether two deterministic finite
automata accepting well-ordered regular languages accept isomorphic languages.
We also give estimates on the size of the smallest automaton representing an
ordinal less than omega^omega, together with an algorithm that translates each
such ordinal to an automaton."
"A language L is closed if L = L*. We consider an operation on closed
languages, L-*, that is an inverse to Kleene closure. It is known that if L is
closed and regular, then L-* is also regular. We show that the analogous result
fails to hold for the context-free languages. Along the way we find a new
relationship between the unbordered words and the prime palstars of Knuth,
Morris, and Pratt. We use this relationship to enumerate the prime palstars,
and we prove that neither the language of all unbordered words nor the language
of all prime palstars is context-free."
"This paper deals with the reachability analysis of {P,A}-Time Petri nets
({P,A}-TPN in short) in the context of strong semantics. It investigates the
convexity of the union of state classes reached by different interleavings of
the same set of transitions. In BB08, the authors have considered the T-TPN
model and its Contracted State Class Graph (CSCG) and shown that this union is
not necessarily convex. They have however established some sufficient
conditions which ensure convexity. This paper shows that for the CSCG of
{P,A}-TPN, this union is convex and can be computed without computing
intermediate state classes. These results allow to improve the forward
reachability analysis by agglomerating, in the same state class, all state
classes reached by different interleavings of the same set of transitions
(abstraction by convex-union)."
"We propose an extension of the zone-based algorithmics for analyzing timed
automata to handle systems where timing uncertainty is considered as
probabilistic rather than set-theoretic. We study duration probabilistic
automata (DPA), expressing multiple parallel processes admitting memoryfull
continuously-distributed durations. For this model we develop an extension of
the zone-based forward reachability algorithm whose successor operator is a
density transformer, thus providing a solution to verification and performance
evaluation problems concerning acyclic DPA (or the bounded-horizon behavior of
cyclic DPA)."
"This paper presents the Pi-graphs, a visual paradigm for the modelling and
verification of mobile systems. The language is a graphical variant of the
Pi-calculus with iterators to express non-terminating behaviors. The
operational semantics of Pi-graphs use ground notions of labelled transition
and bisimulation, which means standard verification techniques can be applied.
We show that bisimilarity is decidable for the proposed semantics, a result
obtained thanks to an original notion of causal clock as well as the automatic
garbage collection of unused names."
"This paper addresses the symbolic representation of non-convex real
polyhedra, i.e., sets of real vectors satisfying arbitrary Boolean combinations
of linear constraints. We develop an original data structure for representing
such sets, based on an implicit and concise encoding of a known structure, the
Real Vector Automaton. The resulting formalism provides a canonical
representation of polyhedra, is closed under Boolean operators, and admits an
efficient decision procedure for testing the membership of a vector."
"Deterministic graph grammars generate regular graphs, that form a structural
extension of configuration graphs of pushdown systems. In this paper, we study
a probabilistic extension of regular graphs obtained by labelling the terminal
arcs of the graph grammars by probabilities. Stochastic properties of these
graphs are expressed using PCTL, a probabilistic extension of computation tree
logic. We present here an algorithm to perform approximate verification of PCTL
formulae. Moreover, we prove that the exact model-checking problem for PCTL on
probabilistic regular graphs is undecidable, unless restricting to qualitative
properties. Our results generalise those of EKM06, on probabilistic pushdown
automata, using similar methods combined with graph grammars techniques."
"We present here Imitator II, a new version of Imitator, a tool implementing
the ""inverse method"" for parametric timed automata: given a reference valuation
of the parameters, it synthesizes a constraint such that, for any valuation
satisfying this constraint, the system behaves the same as under the reference
valuation in terms of traces, i.e., alternating sequences of locations and
actions. Imitator II also implements the ""behavioral cartography algorithm"",
allowing us to solve the following good parameters problem: find a set of
valuations within a given bounded parametric domain for which the system
behaves well. We present new features and optimizations of the tool, and give
results of applications to various examples of asynchronous circuits and
communication protocols."
"The combined trace (i.e., comtrace) notion was introduced by Janicki and
Koutny in 1995 as a generalization of the Mazurkiewicz trace notion. Comtraces
are congruence classes of step sequences, where the congruence relation is
defined from two relations simultaneity and serializability on events. They
also showed that comtraces correspond to some class of labeled stratified order
structures, but left open the question of what class of labeled stratified
orders represents comtraces. In this work, we proposed a class of labeled
stratified order structures that captures exactly the comtrace notion. Our main
technical contributions are representation theorems showing that comtrace
quotient monoid, combined dependency graph (Kleijn and Koutny 2008) and our
labeled stratified order structure characterization are three different and yet
equivalent ways to represent comtraces. This paper is a revised and expanded
version of L\^e (in Proceedings of PETRI NETS 2010, LNCS 6128, pp. 104-124)."
"We settle the equivalence between the problem of hitting a polyhedral set by
the orbit of a linear map and the intersection of a regular language and a
language of permutations of binary words (the permutation filter realizability
problem). The decidability of the both problems is presently unknown and the
first one is a straightforward generalization of the famous Skolem problem and
the nonnegativity problem in the theory of linear recurrent sequences. To show
a `borderline' status of the permutation filter realizability problem with
respect to computability we present some decidable and undecidable problems
closely related to it."
"We present probabilistic arithmetic automata (PAAs), a general model to
describe chains of operations whose operands depend on chance, along with two
different algorithms to exactly calculate the distribution of the results
obtained by such probabilistic calculations. PAAs provide a unifying framework
to approach many problems arising in computational biology and elsewhere. Here,
we present five different applications, namely (1) pattern matching statistics
on random texts, including the computation of the distribution of occurrence
counts, waiting time and clump size under HMM background models; (2) exact
analysis of window-based pattern matching algorithms; (3) sensitivity of
filtration seeds used to detect candidate sequence alignments; (4) length and
mass statistics of peptide fragments resulting from enzymatic cleavage
reactions; and (5) read length statistics of 454 sequencing reads. The
diversity of these applications indicates the flexibility and unifying
character of the presented framework.
  While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular application, we
single out a frequently applicable construction method for pattern statistics:
We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic
calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA from a given
DAA and a finite-memory random text model. We show how to transform a finite
automaton into a DAA and then into the corresponding PAA."
"Timed automata and register automata are well-known models of computation
over timed and data words respectively. The former has clocks that allow to
test the lapse of time between two events, whilst the latter includes registers
that can store data values for later comparison. Although these two models
behave in appearance differently, several decision problems have the same
(un)decidability and complexity results for both models. As a prominent
example, emptiness is decidable for alternating automata with one clock or
register, both with non-primitive recursive complexity. This is not by chance.
  This work confirms that there is indeed a tight relationship between the two
models. We show that a run of a timed automaton can be simulated by a register
automaton, and conversely that a run of a register automaton can be simulated
by a timed automaton. Our results allow to transfer complexity and decidability
results back and forth between these two kinds of models. We justify the
usefulness of these reductions by obtaining new results on register automata."
"This is a tutorial on finite automata. We present the standard material on
determinization and minimization, as well as an account of the equivalence of
finite automata and monadic second-order logic. We conclude with an
introduction to the syntactic monoid, and as an application give a proof of the
equivalence of first-order definability and aperiodicity."
"In this paper, we introduce the problem of synthesizing optimal controllers
for discrete event systems and we propose a procedure for solving this problem,
where the method and specifications are represented by finite state automata
and with increasing complexity. We will subscribe to the synthetic methodology
by the control theory initiated by supervision by Ramadge and Wonham. For an
illustration on a simple example, then a model with a complexity high. In this
spirit, languages, methods and tools development used to specify and
development must reach a level of quality to meet the requirements expressed.
Face this situation, we are helping in this work the systematic use of formal
methods in systems development cycles in the equipping and adapting the UML
(Unified Modeling Language) which is the most exploited in industrial projects."
"The computational complexity of the isomorphism problem for regular trees,
regular linear orders, and regular words is analyzed. A tree is regular if it
is isomorphic to the prefix order on a regular language. In case regular
languages are represented by NFAs (DFAs), the isomorphism problem for regular
trees turns out to be EXPTIME-complete (resp. P-complete). In case the input
automata are acyclic NFAs (acyclic DFAs), the corresponding trees are
(succinctly represented) finite trees, and the isomorphism problem turns out to
be PSPACE-complete (resp. P-complete). A linear order is regular if it is
isomorphic to the lexicographic order on a regular language. A polynomial time
algorithm for the isomorphism problem for regular linear orders (and even
regular words, which generalize the latter) given by DFAs is presented. This
solves an open problem by Esik and Bloom."
"We study cellular automata with respect to a new communication complexity
problem: each of two players know half of some finite word, and must be able to
tell whether the state of the central cell will follow a given evolution, by
communicating as little as possible between each other. We present some links
with classical dynamical concepts, especially equicontinuity, expansiveness,
entropy and give the asymptotic communication complexity of most elementary
cellular automata."
"We show that various aspects of k-automatic sequences -- such as having an
unbordered factor of length n -- are both decidable and effectively enumerable.
As a consequence it follows that many related sequences are either k-automatic
or k-regular. These include many sequences previously studied in the
literature, such as the recurrence function, the appearance function, and the
repetitivity index. We also give some new characterizations of the class of
k-regular sequences. Many results extend to other sequences defined in terms of
Pisot numeration systems."
"In this paper we investigate the word problem of the free Burnside semigroup
satisfying x^2=x^3 and having two generators. Elements of this semigroup are
classes of equivalent words. A natural way to solve the word problem is to
select a unique ""canonical"" representative for each equivalence class. We prove
that overlap-free words and so-called almost overlap-free words (this notion is
some generalization of the notion of overlap-free words) can serve as canonical
representatives for corresponding equivalence classes. We show that such a word
in a given class, if any, can be efficiently found. As a result, we construct a
linear-time algorithm that partially solves the word problem for the semigroup
under consideration."
"In our recent paper we have established close relationships between state
reduction of a fuzzy recognizer and resolution of a particular system of fuzzy
relation equations. In that paper we have also studied reductions by means of
those solutions which are fuzzy equivalences. In this paper we will see that in
some cases better reductions can be obtained using the solutions of this system
that are fuzzy quasi-orders. Generally, fuzzy quasi-orders and fuzzy
equivalences are equally good in the state reduction, but we show that right
and left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders give better reductions than right and
left invariant fuzzy equivalences. We also show that alternate reductions by
means of fuzzy quasi-orders give better results than alternate reductions by
means of fuzzy equivalences. Furthermore we study a more general type of fuzzy
quasi-orders, weakly right and left invariant ones, and we show that they are
closely related to determinization of fuzzy recognizers. We also demonstrate
some applications of weakly left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders in conflict
analysis of fuzzy discrete event systems."
"Bisimulations have been widely used in many areas of computer science to
model equivalence between various systems, and to reduce the number of states
of these systems, whereas uniform fuzzy relations have recently been introduced
as a means to model the fuzzy equivalence between elements of two possible
different sets. Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful
tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a
uniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ is a
forward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward
bisimulation fuzzy equivalences on $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ and there is a special
isomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy
equivalences. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$
are UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them,
if and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata
of $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ with respect to their greatest forward bisimulation
fuzzy equivalences. This result reduces the problem of testing UFB-equivalence
to the problem of testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely
related to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar
results for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental
differences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and
forward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give
a comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic,
nondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to
bisimulations."
"We consider the problem of computing the value and an optimal strategy for
minimizing the expected termination time in one-counter Markov decision
processes. Since the value may be irrational and an optimal strategy may be
rather complicated, we concentrate on the problems of approximating the value
up to a given error epsilon > 0 and computing a finite representation of an
epsilon-optimal strategy. We show that these problems are solvable in
exponential time for a given configuration, and we also show that they are
computationally hard in the sense that a polynomial-time approximation
algorithm cannot exist unless P=NP."
"Two topics are presented: synchronization games and synchronization costs. In
a synchronization game on a deterministic finite automaton, there are two
players, Alice and Bob, whose moves alternate. Alice wants to synchronize the
given automaton, while Bob aims to make her task as hard as possible. We answer
a few natural questions related to such games. Speaking about synchronization
costs, we consider deterministic automata in which each transition has a
certain price. The problem is whether or not a given automaton can be
synchronized within a given budget. We determine the complexity of this
problem. We also formulate a few open questions."
"We study cellular automata on regular rooted trees. This includes the
characterization of sofic tree shifts in terms of unrestricted Rabin automata
and the decidability of the surjectivity problem for cellular automata between
sofic tree shifts."
"Given a basic process algebra (BPA) and two stack symbols, the BPA
bisimilarity problem asks whether the two stack symbols are bisimilar. We show
that this problem is EXPTIME-hard."
"By adapting the iterative yardstick construction of Stockmeyer, we show that
the reachability problem for vector addition systems with a stack does not have
elementary complexity. As a corollary, the same lower bound holds for the
satisfiability problem for a two-variable first-order logic on trees in which
unbounded data may label only leaf nodes. Whether the two problems are
decidable remains an open question."
"We define a class of languages of infinite words over infinite alphabets, and
the corresponding automata. The automata used for recognition are a
generalisation of deterministic Muller automata to the setting of nominal sets.
Remarkably, the obtained languages are determined by their ultimately periodic
fragments, as in the classical case. Closure under complement, union and
intersection, and decidability of emptiness and equivalence are preserved by
the generalisation. This is shown by using finite representations of the
(otherwise infinite-state) defined class of automata."
"Two finite words $u,v$ are 2-binomially equivalent if, for all words $x$ of
length at most 2, the number of occurrences of $x$ as a (scattered) subword of
$u$ is equal to the number of occurrences of $x$ in $v$. This notion is a
refinement of the usual abelian equivalence. A 2-binomial square is a word $uv$
where $u$ and $v$ are 2-binomially equivalent.
  In this paper, considering pure morphic words, we prove that 2-binomial
squares (resp. cubes) are avoidable over a 3-letter (resp. 2-letter) alphabet.
The sizes of the alphabets are optimal."
"We consider the growth, order, and finiteness problems for automaton
(semi)groups. We propose new implementations and compare them with the existing
ones. As a result of extensive experimentations, we propose some conjectures on
the order of finite automaton (semi)groups."
"Adding modular predicates yields a generalization of first-order logic FO
over words. The expressive power of FO[<,MOD] with order comparison $x<y$ and
predicates for $x \equiv i \mod n$ has been investigated by Barrington,
Compton, Straubing and Therien. The study of FO[<,MOD]-fragments was initiated
by Chaubard, Pin and Straubing. More recently, Dartois and Paperman showed that
definability in the two-variable fragment FO2[<,MOD] is decidable. In this
paper we continue this line of work.
  We give an effective algebraic characterization of the word languages in
Sigma2[<,MOD]. The fragment Sigma2 consists of first-order formulas in prenex
normal form with two blocks of quantifiers starting with an existential block.
In addition we show that Delta2[<,MOD], the largest subclass of Sigma2[<,MOD]
which is closed under negation, has the same expressive power as two-variable
logic FO2[<,MOD]. This generalizes the result FO2[<] = Delta2[<] of Therien and
Wilke to modular predicates. As a byproduct, we obtain another decidable
characterization of FO2[<,MOD]."
"In this article we provide a new perspective on the word problem of a group
by using languages of nested words. These were introduced by Alur and
Madhusudan as a way to model programming languages such as HTML. We demonstrate
how a class of nested word languages called visibly pushdown can be used to
study the word problem of virtually free groups in a natural way."
"Antonenko and Russyev independently have shown that any Mealy automaton with
no cycles with exit--that is, where every cycle in the underlying directed
graph is a sink component--generates a fi- nite (semi)group, regardless of the
choice of the production functions. Antonenko has proved that this constitutes
a characterization in the non-invertible case and asked for the invertible
case, which is proved in this paper."
"A method for selecting solution constructors in narrowing is presented. The
method is based on a sort discipline that describes regular sets of ground
constructor terms as sorts. It is extended to cope with regular sets of ground
substitutions, thus allowing different sorts to be computed for terms with
different variable bindings. An algorithm for computing signatures of
equationally defined functions is given that allows potentially infinite
overloading. Applications to formal program development are sketched."
"In his seminal paper on morphogenesis (1952), Alan Turing demonstrated that
different spatio-temporal patterns can arise due to instability of the
homogeneous state in reaction-diffusion systems, but at least two species are
necessary to produce even the simplest stationary patterns. This paper is aimed
to propose a novel model of the analog (continuous state) kinetic automaton and
to show that stationary and dynamic patterns can arise in one-component
networks of kinetic automata. Possible applicability of kinetic networks to
modeling of real-world phenomena is also discussed."
"Given a language $L$ that is online recognizable in linear time and space, we
construct a linear time and space online recognition algorithm for the language
$L\cdot\mathrm{Pal}$, where $\mathrm{Pal}$ is the language of all nonempty
palindromes. Hence for every fixed positive $k$, $\mathrm{Pal}^k$ is online
recognizable in linear time and space. Thus we solve an open problem posed by
Galil and Seiferas in 1978."
"We investigate the monoid of transformations that are induced by sequences of
writing to and reading from a queue storage. We describe this monoid by means
of a confluent and terminating semi-Thue system and study some of its basic
algebraic properties, e.g., conjugacy. Moreover, we show that while several
properties concerning its rational subsets are undecidable, their uniform
membership problem is NL-complete. Furthermore, we present an algebraic
characterization of this monoid's recognizable subsets. Finally, we prove that
it is not Thurston-automatic."
"Inspired by distributed algorithms, we introduce a new class of finite graph
automata that recognize precisely the graph languages definable in monadic
second-order logic. For the cases of words and trees, it has been long known
that the regular languages are precisely those definable in monadic
second-order logic. In this regard, the automata proposed in the present work
can be seen, to some extent, as a generalization of finite automata to graphs.
  Furthermore, we show that, unlike for finite automata on words and trees, the
deterministic, nondeterministic and alternating variants of our automata form a
strict hierarchy with respect to their expressive power. For the weaker
variants, the emptiness problem is decidable."
"Model checking timed automata becomes increasingly complex with the increase
in the number of clocks. Hence it is desirable that one constructs an automaton
with the minimum number of clocks possible. The problem of checking whether
there exists a timed automaton with a smaller number of clocks such that the
timed language accepted by the original automaton is preserved is known to be
undecidable. In this paper, we give a construction, which for any given timed
automaton produces a timed bisimilar automaton with the least number of clocks.
Further, we show that such an automaton with the minimum possible number of
clocks can be constructed in time that is doubly exponential in the number of
clocks of the original automaton."
"We investigate the quantifier alternation hierarchy in first-order logic on
finite words. Levels in this hierarchy are defined by counting the number of
quantifier alternations in formulas. We prove that one can decide membership of
a regular language to the levels $\mathcal{B}\Sigma_2$ (boolean combination of
formulas having only 1 alternation) and $\Sigma_3$ (formulas having only 2
alternations beginning with an existential block). Our proof works by
considering a deeper problem, called separation, which, once solved for lower
levels, allows us to solve membership for higher levels."
"A synchronizing word for an automaton is a word that brings that automaton
into one and the same state, regardless of the starting position. Cerny
conjectured in 1964 that if a n-state deterministic automaton has a
synchronizing word, then it has a synchronizing word of size at most (n-1)^2.
Berlinkov recently made a breakthrough in the probabilistic analysis of
synchronization by proving that with high probability, an automaton has a
synchronizing word. In this article, we prove that with high probability an
automaton admits a synchronizing word of length smaller than n^(1+\epsilon),
and therefore that the Cerny conjecture holds with high probability."
"The new finite state machine package in the mathematics software system
SageMath is presented and illustrated by many examples. Several combinatorial
problems, in particular digit problems, are introduced, modeled by automata and
transducers and solved using SageMath. In particular, we compute the asymptotic
Hamming weight of a non-adjacent-form-like digit expansion, which was not known
before."
"We introduce the notion of Hypergraph Weighted Model (HWM) that generically
associates a tensor network to a hypergraph and then computes a value by tensor
contractions directed by its hyperedges. A series r defined on a hypergraph
family is said to be recognizable if there exists a HWM that computes it. This
model generalizes the notion of rational series on strings and trees. We prove
some properties of the model and study at which conditions finite support
series are recognizable."
"For a finite word $w$ of length $n$ and a class of finite automata $\mathcal
A$, we study the Kolmogorov structure function $h_w$ for automatic complexity
restricted to $\mathcal A$. We propose an approach to computational statistics
based on the minimum $p$-value of $h_w(m)$ over $0\le m\le n$. When $\mathcal
A$ is the class of all finite automata we give some upper bounds for $h_w$.
When $\mathcal A$ consists of automata that detect several success runs in $w$,
we give efficient algorithms to compute $h_w$. When $\mathcal A$ consists of
automata that detect one success run, we moreover give an efficient algorithm
to compute the $p$-values."
