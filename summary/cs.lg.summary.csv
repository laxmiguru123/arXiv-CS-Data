summary
"This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning
based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy
of smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an
additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper
defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational
power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions.
The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves
that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known
as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of
state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q
through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that
MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much
faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the
value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and
execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the
policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the
effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the
paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the
design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning."
"Many researchers have explored methods for hierarchical reinforcement
learning (RL) with temporal abstractions, in which abstract actions are defined
that can perform many primitive actions before terminating. However, little is
known about learning with state abstractions, in which aspects of the state
space are ignored. In previous work, we developed the MAXQ method for
hierarchical RL. In this paper, we define five conditions under which state
abstraction can be combined with the MAXQ value function decomposition. We
prove that the MAXQ-Q learning algorithm converges under these conditions and
show experimentally that state abstraction is important for the successful
application of MAXQ-Q learning."
"The multiplicative Newton-like method developed by the author et al. is
extended to the situation where the dynamics is restricted to the orthogonal
group. A general framework is constructed without specifying the cost function.
Though the restriction to the orthogonal groups makes the problem somewhat
complicated, an explicit expression for the amount of individual jumps is
obtained. This algorithm is exactly second-order-convergent. The global
instability inherent in the Newton method is remedied by a
Levenberg-Marquardt-type variation. The method thus constructed can readily be
applied to the independent component analysis. Its remarkable performance is
illustrated by a numerical simulation."
"We construct new algorithms from scratch, which use the fourth order cumulant
of stochastic variables for the cost function. The multiplicative updating rule
here constructed is natural from the homogeneous nature of the Lie group and
has numerous merits for the rigorous treatment of the dynamics. As one
consequence, the second order convergence is shown. For the cost function,
functions invariant under the componentwise scaling are choosen. By identifying
points which can be transformed to each other by the scaling, we assume that
the dynamics is in a coset space. In our method, a point can move toward any
direction in this coset. Thus, no prewhitening is required."
"Given a reference computer, Kolmogorov complexity is a well defined function
on all binary strings. In the standard approach, however, only the asymptotic
properties of such functions are considered because they do not depend on the
reference computer. We argue that this approach can be more useful if it is
refined to include an important practical case of simple binary strings.
Kolmogorov complexity calculus may be developed for this case if we restrict
the class of available reference computers. The interesting problem is to
define a class of computers which is restricted in a {\it natural} way modeling
the real-life situation where only a limited class of computers is physically
available to us. We give an example of what such a natural restriction might
look like mathematically, and show that under such restrictions some error
terms, even logarithmic in complexity, can disappear from the standard
complexity calculus.
  Keywords: Kolmogorov complexity; Algorithmic information theory."
"In real-world environments it usually is difficult to specify target
operating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs.
This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We
show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at
least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In
some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best
known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of
comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy,
expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid
also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a
method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise
class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH)
method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and
computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned
classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management
of classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and
sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust
hybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems."
"An approach to clustering is presented that adapts the basic top-down
induction of decision trees method towards clustering. To this aim, it employs
the principles of instance based learning. The resulting methodology is
implemented in the TIC (Top down Induction of Clustering trees) system for
first order clustering. The TIC system employs the first order logical decision
tree representation of the inductive logic programming system Tilde. Various
experiments with TIC are presented, in both propositional and relational
domains."
"When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning
techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency.
Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also
less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic
programming systems are small according to general standards within the data
mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that
several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled
independently.
  Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic
programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing
ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context
of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and
to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations
corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the
expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a
large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).
  As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system
Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which
loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by
one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can
handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed
scales up linearly in the number of examples."
"In order for an agent to perform well in partially observable domains, it is
usually necessary for actions to depend on the history of observations. In this
paper, we explore a {\it stigmergic} approach, in which the agent's actions
include the ability to set and clear bits in an external memory, and the
external memory is included as part of the input to the agent. In this case, we
need to learn a reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain. We explore
two algorithms: SARSA(\lambda), which has had empirical success in partially
observable domains, and VAPS, a new algorithm due to Baird and Moore, with
convergence guarantees in partially observable domains. We compare the
performance of these two algorithms on benchmark problems."
"Cross-validation is a useful and generally applicable technique often
employed in machine learning, including decision tree induction. An important
disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its
computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the
computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by
integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction
process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to
this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield.
The analysis is supported by experimental results."
"The Markov Blanket Bayesian Classifier is a recently-proposed algorithm for
construction of probabilistic classifiers. This paper presents an empirical
comparison of the MBBC algorithm with three other Bayesian classifiers: Naive
Bayes, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes and a general Bayesian network. All of these
are implemented using the K2 framework of Cooper and Herskovits. The
classifiers are compared in terms of their performance (using simple accuracy
measures and ROC curves) and speed, on a range of standard benchmark data sets.
It is concluded that MBBC is competitive in terms of speed and accuracy with
the other algorithms considered."
"In biological data, it is often the case that observed data are available
only for a subset of samples. When a kernel matrix is derived from such data,
we have to leave the entries for unavailable samples as missing. In this paper,
we make use of a parametric model of kernel matrices, and estimate missing
entries by fitting the model to existing entries. The parametric model is
created as a set of spectral variants of a complete kernel matrix derived from
another information source. For model fitting, we adopt the em algorithm based
on the information geometry of positive definite matrices. We will report
promising results on bacteria clustering experiments using two marker
sequences: 16S and gyrB."
"To learn (statistical) dependencies among random variables requires
exponentially large sample size in the number of observed random variables if
any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur.
  We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities
can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i.e., by a graph with small
in-degree \Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high
confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set
of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to
select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on
the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous
paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.
  The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree
\Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for
constant \Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can
be found by convex optimization."
"We make progress on two important problems regarding attribute efficient
learnability.
  First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length $k$ over
$n$ variables using $2^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})} \log n$ examples and time
$n^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$. This is the first algorithm for learning decision
lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running
time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship
between attribute efficient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is
based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold
functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction
matches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives
an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree
and weight.
  Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$
out of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$.
For $k=o(\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample
complexity $o(n)$. This is the first polynomial time algorithm for learning
parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity."
"Using naive Bayes for email classification has become very popular within the
last few months. They are quite easy to implement and very efficient. In this
paper we want to present empirical results of email classification using a
combination of naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor searches. Using this
technique we show that the accuracy of a Bayes filter can be improved slightly
for a high number of features and significantly for a small number of features."
"It is offered to pool test points of different subjects and different aspects
of the same subject together in order to get the unitary rating score, by the
way of nonlinear transformation of indicator points in accordance with Zipf's
distribution. It is proposed to use the well-studied distribution of
Intellectuality Quotient IQ as the reference distribution for latent variable
""progress in studies""."
"For the last years, time-series mining has become a challenging issue for
researchers. An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which
require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns. Any
deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected
situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of
several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining
heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns. The
proposed approach allows for mixed time-series -- containing both pattern and
non-pattern data -- such as for imprecise matches, outliers, stretching and
global translating of patterns instances in time. We present the early results
of our approach in the context of monitoring the health status of a person at
home. The purpose is to build a behavioral profile of a person by analyzing the
time variations of several quantitative or qualitative parameters recorded
through a provision of sensors installed in the home."
"We discuss stability for a class of learning algorithms with respect to noisy
labels. The algorithms we consider are for regression, and they involve the
minimization of regularized risk functionals, such as L(f) := 1/N sum_i
(f(x_i)-y_i)^2+ lambda ||f||_H^2. We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when
y_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the
algorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously
vanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N
points remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N
-> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is
the expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we
describe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give
conditions for convergence. In the process, we develop a set of tools for
dealing with functionals such as L(f), which are applicable to many other
problems in learning theory."
"We consider the probability hierarchy for Popperian FINite learning and study
the general properties of this hierarchy. We prove that the probability
hierarchy is decidable, i.e. there exists an algorithm that receives p_1 and
p_2 and answers whether PFIN-type learning with the probability of success p_1
is equivalent to PFIN-type learning with the probability of success p_2.
  To prove our result, we analyze the topological structure of the probability
hierarchy. We prove that it is well-ordered in descending ordering and
order-equivalent to ordinal epsilon_0. This shows that the structure of the
hierarchy is very complicated.
  Using similar methods, we also prove that, for PFIN-type learning, team
learning and probabilistic learning are of the same power."
"We analyze a new algorithm for probability forecasting of binary observations
on the basis of the available data, without making any assumptions about the
way the observations are generated. The algorithm is shown to be well
calibrated and to have good resolution for long enough sequences of
observations and for a suitable choice of its parameter, a kernel on the
Cartesian product of the forecast space $[0,1]$ and the data space. Our main
results are non-asymptotic: we establish explicit inequalities, shown to be
tight, for the performance of the algorithm."
"We consider a general class of forecasting protocols, called ""linear
protocols"", and discuss several important special cases, including multi-class
forecasting. Forecasting is formalized as a game between three players:
Reality, whose role is to generate observations; Forecaster, whose goal is to
predict the observations; and Skeptic, who tries to make money on any lack of
agreement between Forecaster's predictions and the actual observations. Our
main mathematical result is that for any continuous strategy for Skeptic in a
linear protocol there exists a strategy for Forecaster that does not allow
Skeptic's capital to grow. This result is a meta-theorem that allows one to
transform any continuous law of probability in a linear protocol into a
forecasting strategy whose predictions are guaranteed to satisfy this law. We
apply this meta-theorem to a weak law of large numbers in Hilbert spaces to
obtain a version of the K29 prediction algorithm for linear protocols and show
that this version also satisfies the attractive properties of proper
calibration and resolution under a suitable choice of its kernel parameter,
with no assumptions about the way the data is generated."
"This article offers a 3-parameter model of testing, with 1) the difference
between the ability level of the examinee and item difficulty; 2) the examinee
discrimination and 3) the item discrimination as model parameters."
"We propose a new framework for building and evaluating machine learning
algorithms. We argue that many real-world problems require an agent which must
quickly learn to respond to demands, yet can continue to perform and respond to
new training throughout its useful life. We give a framework for how such
agents can be built, describe several metrics for evaluating them, and show
that subtle changes in system construction can significantly affect agent
performance."
"We present in this work a new methodology to design kernels on data which is
structured with smaller components, such as text, images or sequences. This
methodology is a template procedure which can be applied on most kernels on
measures and takes advantage of a more detailed ""bag of components""
representation of the objects. To obtain such a detailed description, we
consider possible decompositions of the original bag into a collection of
nested bags, following a prior knowledge on the objects' structure. We then
consider these smaller bags to compare two objects both in a detailed
perspective, stressing local matches between the smaller bags, and in a global
or coarse perspective, by considering the entire bag. This multiresolution
approach is likely to be best suited for tasks where the coarse approach is not
precise enough, and where a more subtle mixture of both local and global
similarities is necessary to compare objects. The approach presented here would
not be computationally tractable without a factorization trick that we
introduce before presenting promising results on an image retrieval task."
"This paper shows how universal learning can be achieved with expert advice.
To this aim, we specify an experts algorithm with the following
characteristics: (a) it uses only feedback from the actions actually chosen
(bandit setup), (b) it can be applied with countably infinite expert classes,
and (c) it copes with losses that may grow in time appropriately slowly. We
prove loss bounds against an adaptive adversary. From this, we obtain a master
algorithm for ""reactive"" experts problems, which means that the master's
actions may influence the behavior of the adversary. Our algorithm can
significantly outperform standard experts algorithms on such problems. Finally,
we combine it with a universal expert class. The resulting universal learner
performs -- in a certain sense -- almost as well as any computable strategy,
for any online decision problem. We also specify the (worst-case) convergence
speed, which is very slow."
"A main problem of ""Follow the Perturbed Leader"" strategies for online
decision problems is that regret bounds are typically proven against oblivious
adversary. In partial observation cases, it was not clear how to obtain
performance guarantees against adaptive adversary, without worsening the
bounds. We propose a conceptually simple argument to resolve this problem.
Using this, a regret bound of O(t^(2/3)) for FPL in the adversarial multi-armed
bandit problem is shown. This bound holds for the common FPL variant using only
the observations from designated exploration rounds. Using all observations
allows for the stronger bound of O(t^(1/2)), matching the best bound known so
far (and essentially the known lower bound) for adversarial bandits.
Surprisingly, this variant does not even need explicit exploration, it is
self-stabilizing. However the sampling probabilities have to be either
externally provided or approximated to sufficient accuracy, using O(t^2 log t)
samples in each step."
"Naive Bayes is a simple Bayesian classifier with strong independence
assumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong
independence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that
relaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve
the classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an
optimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring
measure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time
optimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have
examined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a
Naive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN
structure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and
present a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to
MDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the
augmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a
relaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search
methods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets. The
authors, however, evaluate the learned structure only in terms of observed
misclassification error and not against a scoring metric, such as MDL. In this
paper, we present a simple, polynomial time greedy algorithm for learning an
optimal Augmented Bayes Network with respect to MDL score."
"We consider the problem of learning unions of rectangles over the domain
$[b]^n$, in the uniform distribution membership query learning setting, where
both b and n are ""large"". We obtain poly$(n, \log b)$-time algorithms for the
following classes:
  - poly$(n \log b)$-way Majority of $O(\frac{\log(n \log b)} {\log \log(n \log
b)})$-dimensional rectangles.
  - Union of poly$(\log(n \log b))$ many $O(\frac{\log^2 (n \log b)} {(\log
\log(n \log b) \log \log \log (n \log b))^2})$-dimensional rectangles.
  - poly$(n \log b)$-way Majority of poly$(n \log b)$-Or of disjoint
$O(\frac{\log(n \log b)} {\log \log(n \log b)})$-dimensional rectangles.
  Our main algorithmic tool is an extension of Jackson's boosting- and
Fourier-based Harmonic Sieve algorithm [Jackson 1997] to the domain $[b]^n$,
building on work of [Akavia, Goldwasser, Safra 2003]. Other ingredients used to
obtain the results stated above are techniques from exact learning [Beimel,
Kushilevitz 1998] and ideas from recent work on learning augmented $AC^{0}$
circuits [Jackson, Klivans, Servedio 2002] and on representing Boolean
functions as thresholds of parities [Klivans, Servedio 2001]."
"We consider the problem of on-line prediction of real-valued labels, assumed
bounded in absolute value by a known constant, of new objects from known
labeled objects. The prediction algorithm's performance is measured by the
squared deviation of the predictions from the actual labels. No stochastic
assumptions are made about the way the labels and objects are generated.
Instead, we are given a benchmark class of prediction rules some of which are
hoped to produce good predictions. We show that for a wide range of
infinite-dimensional benchmark classes one can construct a prediction algorithm
whose cumulative loss over the first N examples does not exceed the cumulative
loss of any prediction rule in the class plus O(sqrt(N)); the main differences
from the known results are that we do not impose any upper bound on the norm of
the considered prediction rules and that we achieve an optimal leading term in
the excess loss of our algorithm. If the benchmark class is ""universal"" (dense
in the class of continuous functions on each compact set), this provides an
on-line non-stochastic analogue of universally consistent prediction in
non-parametric statistics. We use two proof techniques: one is based on the
Aggregating Algorithm and the other on the recently developed method of
defensive forecasting."
"The problem of finding an optimum using noisy evaluations of a smooth cost
function arises in many contexts, including economics, business, medicine,
experiment design, and foraging theory. We derive an asymptotic bound E[ (x_t -
x*)^2 ] >= O(1/sqrt(t)) on the rate of convergence of a sequence (x_0, x_1,
>...) generated by an unbiased feedback process observing noisy evaluations of
an unknown quadratic function maximised at x*. The bound is tight, as the proof
leads to a simple algorithm which meets it. We further establish a bound on the
total regret, E[ sum_{i=1..t} (x_i - x*)^2 ] >= O(sqrt(t)) These bounds may
impose practical limitations on an agent's performance, as O(eps^-4) queries
are made before the queries converge to x* with eps accuracy."
"A key data preparation step in Text Mining, Term Extraction selects the
terms, or collocation of words, attached to specific concepts. In this paper,
the task of extracting relevant collocations is achieved through a supervised
learning algorithm, exploiting a few collocations manually labelled as
relevant/irrelevant. The candidate terms are described along 13 standard
statistical criteria measures. From these examples, an evolutionary learning
algorithm termed Roger, based on the optimization of the Area under the ROC
curve criterion, extracts an order on the candidate terms. The robustness of
the approach is demonstrated on two real-world domain applications, considering
different domains (biology and human resources) and different languages
(English and French)."
"We consider the problem of on-line prediction competitive with a benchmark
class of continuous but highly irregular prediction rules. It is known that if
the benchmark class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, there exists a
prediction algorithm whose average loss over the first N examples does not
exceed the average loss of any prediction rule in the class plus a ""regret
term"" of O(N^(-1/2)). The elements of some natural benchmark classes, however,
are so irregular that these classes are not Hilbert spaces. In this paper we
develop Banach-space methods to construct a prediction algorithm with a regret
term of O(N^(-1/p)), where p is in [2,infty) and p-2 reflects the degree to
which the benchmark class fails to be a Hilbert space."
"Fitness functions based on test cases are very common in Genetic Programming
(GP). This process can be assimilated to a learning task, with the inference of
models from a limited number of samples. This paper is an investigation on two
methods to improve generalization in GP-based learning: 1) the selection of the
best-of-run individuals using a three data sets methodology, and 2) the
application of parsimony pressure in order to reduce the complexity of the
solutions. Results using GP in a binary classification setup show that while
the accuracy on the test sets is preserved, with less variances compared to
baseline results, the mean tree size obtained with the tested methods is
significantly reduced."
"It is suggested to insert into test matrix 1s for correct responses, 0s for
response refusals, and negative corrective elements for incorrect responses.
With the classical test theory approach test scores of examinees and items are
calculated traditionally as sums of matrix elements, organized in rows and
columns. Correlation coefficients are estimated using correction coefficients.
In item response theory approach examinee and item logits are estimated using
maximum likelihood method and probabilities of all matrix elements."
"Given a finite set of words w1,...,wn independently drawn according to a
fixed unknown distribution law P called a stochastic language, an usual goal in
Grammatical Inference is to infer an estimate of P in some class of
probabilistic models, such as Probabilistic Automata (PA). Here, we study the
class of rational stochastic languages, which consists in stochastic languages
that can be generated by Multiplicity Automata (MA) and which strictly includes
the class of stochastic languages generated by PA. Rational stochastic
languages have minimal normal representation which may be very concise, and
whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from stochastic samples. We
design an efficient inference algorithm DEES which aims at building a minimal
normal representation of the target. Despite the fact that no recursively
enumerable class of MA computes exactly the set of rational stochastic
languages over Q, we show that DEES strongly identifies tis set in the limit.
We study the intermediary MA output by DEES and show that they compute rational
series which converge absolutely to one and which can be used to provide
stochastic languages which closely estimate the target."
"Consider an agent interacting with an environment in cycles. In every
interaction cycle the agent is rewarded for its performance. We compare the
average reward U from cycle 1 to m (average value) with the future discounted
reward V from cycle k to infinity (discounted value). We consider essentially
arbitrary (non-geometric) discount sequences and arbitrary reward sequences
(non-MDP environments). We show that asymptotically U for m->infinity and V for
k->infinity are equal, provided both limits exist. Further, if the effective
horizon grows linearly with k or faster, then existence of the limit of U
implies that the limit of V exists. Conversely, if the effective horizon grows
linearly with k or slower, then existence of the limit of V implies that the
limit of U exists."
"Suppose we are given two probability measures on the set of one-way infinite
finite-alphabet sequences and consider the question when one of the measures
predicts the other, that is, when conditional probabilities converge (in a
certain sense) when one of the measures is chosen to generate the sequence.
This question may be considered a refinement of the problem of sequence
prediction in its most general formulation: for a given class of probability
measures, does there exist a measure which predicts all of the measures in the
class? To address this problem, we find some conditions on local absolute
continuity which are sufficient for prediction and which generalize several
different notions which are known to be sufficient for prediction. We also
formulate some open questions to outline a direction for finding the conditions
on classes of measures for which prediction is possible."
"Prediction is a complex notion, and different predictors (such as people,
computer programs, and probabilistic theories) can pursue very different goals.
In this paper I will review some popular kinds of prediction and argue that the
theory of competitive on-line learning can benefit from the kinds of prediction
that are now foreign to it."
"A standard approach in pattern classification is to estimate the
distributions of the label classes, and then to apply the Bayes classifier to
the estimates of the distributions in order to classify unlabeled examples. As
one might expect, the better our estimates of the label class distributions,
the better the resulting classifier will be. In this paper we make this
observation precise by identifying risk bounds of a classifier in terms of the
quality of the estimates of the label class distributions. We show how PAC
learnability relates to estimates of the distributions that have a PAC
guarantee on their $L_1$ distance from the true distribution, and we bound the
increase in negative log likelihood risk in terms of PAC bounds on the
KL-divergence. We give an inefficient but general-purpose smoothing method for
converting an estimated distribution that is good under the $L_1$ metric into a
distribution that is good under the KL-divergence."
"In this paper we introduce the class of stationary prediction strategies and
construct a prediction algorithm that asymptotically performs as well as the
best continuous stationary strategy. We make mild compactness assumptions but
no stochastic assumptions about the environment. In particular, no assumption
of stationarity is made about the environment, and the stationarity of the
considered strategies only means that they do not depend explicitly on time; we
argue that it is natural to consider only stationary strategies even for highly
non-stationary environments."
"In probabilistic grammatical inference, a usual goal is to infer a good
approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The
estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as
probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models
based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA
are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic
languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical
representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable,
it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES,
introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is
not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA
that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use
these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader
class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages.
The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of
pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for
example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have
carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical
inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms
them in most cases."
"We investigate here concept learning from incomplete examples. Our first
purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be
modified in order to cope with data incompleteness. More precisely we are
interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by
L. De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical
propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We
are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the
Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to
slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a
solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information
concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First,
uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second,
generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the
example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of
incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is
known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as ""learning from
possibilities"" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific
learning setting, referred to as ""assumption-based learning"" that cope with
examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual
information outside of the proper description of the examples. Assumption-based
learning is illustrated on a recent work concerning the prediction of a
consensus secondary structure common to a set of RNA sequences."
"We present a theory of boosting probabilistic classifiers. We place ourselves
in the situation of a user who only provides a stopping parameter and a
probabilistic weak learner/classifier and compare three types of boosting
algorithms: probabilistic Adaboost, decision tree, and tree of trees of ... of
trees, which we call matryoshka. ""Nested tree,"" ""embedded tree"" and ""recursive
tree"" are also appropriate names for this algorithm, which is one of our
contributions. Our other contribution is the theoretical analysis of the
algorithms, in which we give training error bounds. This analysis suggests that
the matryoshka leverages probabilistic weak classifiers more efficiently than
simple decision trees."
"We start from a simple asymptotic result for the problem of on-line
regression with the quadratic loss function: the class of continuous
limited-memory prediction strategies admits a ""leading prediction strategy"",
which not only asymptotically performs at least as well as any continuous
limited-memory strategy but also satisfies the property that the excess loss of
any continuous limited-memory strategy is determined by how closely it imitates
the leading strategy. More specifically, for any class of prediction strategies
constituting a reproducing kernel Hilbert space we construct a leading
strategy, in the sense that the loss of any prediction strategy whose norm is
not too large is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy.
This result is extended to the loss functions given by Bregman divergences and
by strictly proper scoring rules."
"Assuming that the loss function is convex in the prediction, we construct a
prediction strategy universal for the class of Markov prediction strategies,
not necessarily continuous. Allowing randomization, we remove the requirement
of convexity."
"We present basic notions of Gold's ""learnability in the limit"" paradigm,
first presented in 1967, a formalization of the cognitive process by which a
native speaker gets to grasp the underlying grammar of his/her own native
language by being exposed to well formed sentences generated by that grammar.
Then we present Lambek grammars, a formalism issued from categorial grammars
which, although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural
languages, is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface
between syntax and semantics. In the last part of this work, we present a
learnability result for Rigid Lambek grammars from structured examples."
"An approach to the classification problem of machine learning, based on
building local classification rules, is developed. The local rules are
considered as projections of the global classification rules to the event we
want to classify. A massive global optimization algorithm is used for
optimization of quality criterion. The algorithm, which has polynomial
complexity in typical case, is used to find all high--quality local rules. The
other distinctive feature of the algorithm is the integration of attributes
levels selection (for ordered attributes) with rules searching and original
conflicting rules resolution strategy. The algorithm is practical; it was
tested on a number of data sets from UCI repository, and a comparison with the
other predicting techniques is presented."
"Competitive on-line prediction (also known as universal prediction of
individual sequences) is a strand of learning theory avoiding making any
stochastic assumptions about the way the observations are generated. The
predictor's goal is to compete with a benchmark class of prediction rules,
which is often a proper Banach function space. Metric entropy provides a
unifying framework for competitive on-line prediction: the numerous known upper
bounds on the metric entropy of various compact sets in function spaces readily
imply bounds on the performance of on-line prediction strategies. This paper
discusses strengths and limitations of the direct approach to competitive
on-line prediction via metric entropy, including comparisons to other
approaches."
"We propose and analyze a new vantage point for the learning of mixtures of
Gaussians: namely, the PAC-style model of learning probability distributions
introduced by Kearns et al. Here the task is to construct a hypothesis mixture
of Gaussians that is statistically indistinguishable from the actual mixture
generating the data; specifically, the KL-divergence should be at most epsilon.
  In this scenario, we give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm that learns the
class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned Gaussians in
n-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the
separation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence
on the minimum mixing weight. This is in contrast to learning results known in
the ``clustering'' model, where such assumptions are unavoidable.
  Our algorithm relies on the method of moments, and a subalgorithm developed
in previous work by the authors (FOCS 2005) for a discrete mixture-learning
problem."
"Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to design efficient
prediction algorithms for data sets with huge numbers of parameters. This paper
describes a new technique for ""hedging"" the predictions output by many such
algorithms, including support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, kernel
nearest neighbours, and by many other state-of-the-art methods. The hedged
predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of
their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the
assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and
their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same
probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to
statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a
suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining
goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new
objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate
predictions as possible. This can be done successfully using the powerful
machinery of modern machine learning."
"This paper addresses the issue of policy evaluation in Markov Decision
Processes, using linear function approximation. It provides a unified view of
algorithms such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), iLSTD, residual-gradient TD. It is
asserted that they all consist in minimizing a gradient function and differ by
the form of this function and their means of minimizing it. Two new schemes are
introduced in that framework: Full-gradient TD which uses a generalization of
the principle introduced in iLSTD, and EGD TD, which reduces the gradient by
successive equi-gradient descents. These three algorithms form a new
intermediate family with the interesting property of making much better use of
the samples than TD while keeping a gradient descent scheme, which is useful
for complexity issues and optimistic policy iteration."
"Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when
applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT
algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper
Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to
the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too
``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the
depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search.
First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales
exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D
\sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then
analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with
high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth
Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing
efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we
present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is
too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high
probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed.
We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz
function, given noisy data."
"We propose an axiomatic approach to the concept of an intrinsic dimension of
a dataset, based on a viewpoint of geometry of high-dimensional structures. Our
first axiom postulates that high values of dimension be indicative of the
presence of the curse of dimensionality (in a certain precise mathematical
sense). The second axiom requires the dimension to depend smoothly on a
distance between datasets (so that the dimension of a dataset and that of an
approximating principal manifold would be close to each other). The third axiom
is a normalization condition: the dimension of the Euclidean $n$-sphere $\s^n$
is $\Theta(n)$. We give an example of a dimension function satisfying our
axioms, even though it is in general computationally unfeasible, and discuss a
computationally cheap function satisfying most but not all of our axioms (the
``intrinsic dimensionality'' of Ch\'avez et al.)"
"This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo
Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO."
"We introduce a framework for filtering features that employs the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependence
between the features and the labels. The key idea is that good features should
maximise such dependence. Feature selection for various supervised learning
problems (including classification and regression) is unified under this
framework, and the solutions can be approximated using a backward-elimination
algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on both artificial and
real world datasets."
"Speaker identification is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric
technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels
affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, we present a sub-band based
speaker identification that intends to improve the live testing performance.
Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also
compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands
recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the
non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the
sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved
the performance of the speaker identification over the performance of wide-band
recognizers when tested live. A live testing improvement of 9.78% was achieved"
"Bounds on the risk play a crucial role in statistical learning theory. They
usually involve as capacity measure of the model studied the VC dimension or
one of its extensions. In classification, such ""VC dimensions"" exist for models
taking values in {0, 1}, {1,..., Q} and R. We introduce the generalizations
appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in R^Q. This
provides us with a new guaranteed risk for M-SVMs which appears superior to the
existing one."
"We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a
block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger
than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual
regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is
commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model
consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model
misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced
by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually
referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from
heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools
from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the
consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an
adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary
condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied."
"Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output
or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given
a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of
applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy,
while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to
deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled
are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that
of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this
paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The
learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of
the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This
allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a)
optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition
should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a
performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling
methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to
provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related
field of active learning."
"The method of defensive forecasting is applied to the problem of prediction
with expert advice for binary outcomes. It turns out that defensive forecasting
is not only competitive with the Aggregating Algorithm but also handles the
case of ""second-guessing"" experts, whose advice depends on the learner's
prediction; this paper assumes that the dependence on the learner's prediction
is continuous."
"Defensive forecasting is a method of transforming laws of probability (stated
in game-theoretic terms as strategies for Sceptic) into forecasting algorithms.
There are two known varieties of defensive forecasting: ""continuous"", in which
Sceptic's moves are assumed to depend on the forecasts in a (semi)continuous
manner and which produces deterministic forecasts, and ""randomized"", in which
the dependence of Sceptic's moves on the forecasts is arbitrary and
Forecaster's moves are allowed to be randomized. This note shows that the
randomized variety can be obtained from the continuous variety by smearing
Sceptic's moves to make them continuous."
"We show that the Brier game of prediction is mixable and find the optimal
learning rate and substitution function for it. The resulting prediction
algorithm is applied to predict results of football and tennis matches. The
theoretical performance guarantee turns out to be rather tight on these data
sets, especially in the case of the more extensive tennis data."
"Regularization by the sum of singular values, also referred to as the trace
norm, is a popular technique for estimating low rank rectangular matrices. In
this paper, we extend some of the consistency results of the Lasso to provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency of trace norm
minimization with the square loss. We also provide an adaptive version that is
rank consistent even when the necessary condition for the non adaptive version
is not fulfilled."
"Recent spectral clustering methods are a propular and powerful technique for
data clustering. These methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose
computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples.
In this paper, a non-eigenproblem based clustering method is proposed to deal
with the clustering problem. Its performance is comparable to the spectral
clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity
$O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property,
called K-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with
complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise. Moreover, no
parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm."
"Covariances from categorical variables are defined using a regular simplex
expression for categories. The method follows the variance definition by Gini,
and it gives the covariance as a solution of simultaneous equations. The
calculated results give reasonable values for test data. A method of principal
component analysis (RS-PCA) is also proposed using regular simplex expressions,
which allows easy interpretation of the principal components. The proposed
methods apply to variable selection problem of categorical data USCensus1990
data. The proposed methods give appropriate criterion for the variable
selection problem of categorical"
"The cross-entropy method is a simple but efficient method for global
optimization. In this paper we provide two online variants of the basic CEM,
together with a proof of convergence."
"We prove that the optimal assignment kernel, proposed recently as an attempt
to embed labeled graphs and more generally tuples of basic data to a Hilbert
space, is in fact not always positive definite."
"Given R groups of numerical variables X1, ... XR, we assume that each group
is the result of one underlying latent variable, and that all latent variables
are bound together through a linear equation system. Moreover, we assume that
some explanatory latent variables may interact pairwise in one or more
equations. We basically consider PLS Path Modelling's algorithm to estimate
both latent variables and the model's coefficients. New ""external"" estimation
schemes are proposed that draw latent variables towards strong group structures
in a more flexible way. New ""internal"" estimation schemes are proposed to
enable PLSPM to make good use of variable group complementarity and to deal
with interactions. Application examples are given."
"We present a general approach for collaborative filtering (CF) using spectral
regularization to learn linear operators from ""users"" to the ""objects"" they
rate. Recent low-rank type matrix completion approaches to CF are shown to be
special cases. However, unlike existing regularization based CF methods, our
approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the
users or the objects -- a limitation of existing regularization based CF
methods. We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new
estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank
decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments
indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF
methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we
show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases
of our proposed approach."
"We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which
include the random walk graph kernel \citep{GaeFlaWro03,BorOngSchVisetal05},
marginalized graph kernel \citep{KasTsuIno03,KasTsuIno04,MahUedAkuPeretal04},
and geometric kernel on graphs \citep{Gaertner02}. Through extensions of linear
algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and reduction to a
Sylvester equation, we construct an algorithm that improves the time complexity
of kernel computation from $O(n^6)$ to $O(n^3)$. When the graphs are sparse,
conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations bring our algorithm into
the sub-cubic domain. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other
application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster
than previous approaches. We then explore connections between diffusion kernels
\citep{KonLaf02}, regularization on graphs \citep{SmoKon03}, and graph kernels,
and use these connections to propose new graph kernels. Finally, we show that
rational kernels \citep{CorHafMoh02,CorHafMoh03,CorHafMoh04} when specialized
to graphs reduce to the random walk graph kernel."
"We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability
distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et
al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely
studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree
series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of
multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very
convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees.
First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design
learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by
rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series
correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the
structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can
be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol
may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly
relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the
inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are
equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web
Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked
trees."
"We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential
data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a
positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to
non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive
combination of individually representable observations is also representable by
the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in
computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the
environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding
magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that
leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We
present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation
data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate
their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source
separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized
by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our
results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target
observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple
simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target
states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also
present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are
extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be
useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also
propose a network for language modeling."
"We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of
parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the
regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned
vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the
{\em representer theorem}, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine
learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby
completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We
further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a
problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this
context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger
class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete
examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from
matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing function."
"In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously,
with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each
task may benefit from the others. In the context of learning linear functions
for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including
a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and
how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume
that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that
tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm
that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the
partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization
formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic
examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms
well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non
convex methods dedicated to the same problem."
"We consider the task of learning a classifier from the feature space
$\mathcal{X}$ to the set of classes $\mathcal{Y} = \{0, 1\}$, when the features
can be partitioned into class-conditionally independent feature sets
$\mathcal{X}_1$ and $\mathcal{X}_2$. We show the surprising fact that the
class-conditional independence can be used to represent the original learning
task in terms of 1) learning a classifier from $\mathcal{X}_2$ to
$\mathcal{X}_1$ and 2) learning the class-conditional distribution of the
feature set $\mathcal{X}_1$. This fact can be exploited for semi-supervised
learning because the former task can be accomplished purely from unlabeled
samples. We present experimental evaluation of the idea in two real world
applications."
"Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) and its variants have been very successful
in embedding data-manifolds in lower dimensional spaces, often revealing the
true intrinsic dimension. In this paper we show how to also incorporate
supervised class information into an MVU-like method without breaking its
convexity. We call this method the Isometric Separation Map and we show that
the resulting kernel matrix can be used as a binary/multiclass Support Vector
Machine-like method in a semi-supervised (transductive) framework. We also show
that the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the
training data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces.
In traditional SVMs we choose a kernel and hope that the data become linearly
separable in the kernel space. In this paper we show how the hyperplane can be
chosen ad-hoc and the kernel is trained so that data are always linearly
separable. Comparisons with Large Margin SVMs show comparable performance."
"In this paper, I expand Shannon's definition of entropy into a new form of
entropy that allows integration of information from different random events.
Shannon's notion of entropy is a special case of my more general definition of
entropy. I define probability using a so-called performance function, which is
de facto an exponential distribution. Assuming that my general notion of
entropy reflects the true uncertainty about a probabilistic event, I understand
that our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the
result of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese
philosophy: Yin and Yang. Based on this idea, I show that our perceived
uncertainty matches the true uncertainty in points determined by the golden
ratio. I demonstrate that the well-known sigmoid function, which we typically
employ in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function,
describes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the
time dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that
although time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to
reality. At the end of the paper, I show how to apply this theoretical
framework to practical applications. I present recognition rates for a pattern
recognition problem, and also propose a network architecture that can take
advantage of general entropy to solve complex decision problems."
"Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of
the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In
contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight
generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by
exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory,
existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the
samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning
applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received
by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.
  This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a
stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in
the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between
observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based
generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences.
These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply
to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of
stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.
  We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to
general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression,
Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel
regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms.
These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the
use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios."
"Ensemble classification is an emerging approach to land cover mapping whereby
the final classification output is a result of a consensus of classifiers.
Intuitively, an ensemble system should consist of base classifiers which are
diverse i.e. classifiers whose decision boundaries err differently. In this
paper ensemble feature selection is used to impose diversity in ensembles. The
features of the constituent base classifiers for each ensemble were created
through an exhaustive search algorithm using different separability indices.
For each ensemble, the classification accuracy was derived as well as a
diversity measure purported to give a measure of the inensemble diversity. The
correlation between ensemble classification accuracy and diversity measure was
determined to establish the interplay between the two variables. From the
findings of this paper, diversity measures as currently formulated do not
provide an adequate means upon which to constitute ensembles for land cover
mapping."
"Cooperative decision making is a vision of future network management and
control. Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes
can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic
flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are
spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network.
Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how
accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes.
Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is
optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is
computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work
investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows
to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop,
based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed
algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal
preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and
complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the
distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and
simulation."
"In statistical problems, a set of parameterized probability distributions is
used to estimate the true probability distribution. If Fisher information
matrix at the true distribution is singular, then it has been left unknown what
we can estimate about the true distribution from random samples. In this paper,
we study a singular regression problem and prove a limit theorem which shows
the relation between the singular regression problem and two birational
invariants, a real log canonical threshold and a singular fluctuation. The
obtained theorem has an important application to statistics, because it enables
us to estimate the generalization error from the training error without any
knowledge of the true probability distribution."
"Scenarios for the emergence or bootstrap of a lexicon involve the repeated
interaction between at least two agents who must reach a consensus on how to
name N objects using H words. Here we consider minimal models of two types of
learning algorithms: cross-situational learning, in which the individuals
determine the meaning of a word by looking for something in common across all
observed uses of that word, and supervised operant conditioning learning, in
which there is strong feedback between individuals about the intended meaning
of the words. Despite the stark differences between these learning schemes, we
show that they yield the same communication accuracy in the realistic limits of
large N and H, which coincides with the result of the classical occupancy
problem of randomly assigning N objects to H words."
"In this paper, we propose a technique to extract constrained formal concepts."
"Recently, different works proposed a new way to mine patterns in databases
with pathological size. For example, experiments in genome biology usually
provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects
(experiments). In this case, mining the ""transposed"" database runs through a
smaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed
patterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining
for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and
constraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition
and look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating
the closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint,
starting from those mined in the ""transposed"" database. Finally, we show how to
generate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones."
"We consider multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under
the assumption of output sparsity -- that the target (label) vectors have small
support. We develop a general theory for a variant of the popular error
correcting output code scheme, using ideas from compressed sensing for
exploiting this sparsity. The method can be regarded as a simple reduction from
multi-label regression problems to binary regression problems. We show that the
number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible
labels, making this approach radically more efficient than others. We also
state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret
transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for
the linear prediction setting."
"This paper formalises the concept of learning symbolic rules from multisource
data in a cardiac monitoring context. Our sources, electrocardiograms and
arterial blood pressure measures, describe cardiac behaviours from different
viewpoints. To learn interpretable rules, we use an Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) method. We develop an original strategy to cope with the dimensionality
issues caused by using this ILP technique on a rich multisource language. The
results show that our method greatly improves the feasibility and the
efficiency of the process while staying accurate. They also confirm the

"The problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries is
often encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an
underlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer
vision and control. Most recent work had been focused on constructing efficient
algorithms for exact or approximate recovery of the missing matrix entries and
proving lower bounds for the number of known entries that guarantee a
successful recovery with high probability. A related problem from both the
mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of
realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise
distances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of
the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that
basic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness
of low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that
distances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient
randomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion.
Crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix,
that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix."
"We introduce a new protocol for prediction with expert advice in which each
expert evaluates the learner's and his own performance using a loss function
that may change over time and may be different from the loss functions used by
the other experts. The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse
than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously.
If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all
mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same
performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the
standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the
case of ""specialist"" (or ""sleeping"") experts. In this case, the defensive
forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating
Algorithm."
"We present multiplicative updates for solving hard and soft margin support
vector machines (SVM) with non-negative kernels. They follow as a natural
extension of the updates for non-negative matrix factorization. No additional
param- eter setting, such as choosing learning, rate is required. Ex- periments
demonstrate rapid convergence to good classifiers. We analyze the rates of
asymptotic convergence of the up- dates and establish tight bounds. We test the
performance on several datasets using various non-negative kernels and report
equivalent generalization errors to that of a standard SVM."
"We propose a randomized algorithm for training Support vector machines(SVMs)
on large datasets. By using ideas from Random projections we show that the
combinatorial dimension of SVMs is $O({log} n)$ with high probability. This
estimate of combinatorial dimension is used to derive an iterative algorithm,
called RandSVM, which at each step calls an existing solver to train SVMs on a
randomly chosen subset of size $O({log} n)$. The algorithm has probabilistic
guarantees and is capable of training SVMs with Kernels for both classification
and regression problems. Experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets
demonstrate that the algorithm scales up existing SVM learners, without loss of
accuracy."
"We investigate the problem of learning a topic model - the well-known Latent
Dirichlet Allocation - in a distributed manner, using a cluster of C processors
and dividing the corpus to be learned equally among them. We propose a simple
approximated method that can be tuned, trading speed for accuracy according to
the task at hand. Our approach is asynchronous, and therefore suitable for
clusters of heterogenous machines."
"In this paper, we prove a crucial theorem called Mirroring Theorem which
affirms that given a collection of samples with enough information in it such
that it can be classified into classes and subclasses then (i) There exists a
mapping which classifies and subclassifies these samples (ii) There exists a
hierarchical classifier which can be constructed by using Mirroring Neural
Networks (MNNs) in combination with a clustering algorithm that can approximate
this mapping. Thus, the proof of the Mirroring theorem provides a theoretical
basis for the existence and a practical feasibility of constructing
hierarchical classifiers, given the maps. Our proposed Mirroring Theorem can
also be considered as an extension to Kolmogrovs theorem in providing a
realistic solution for unsupervised classification. The techniques we develop,
are general in nature and have led to the construction of learning machines
which are (i) tree like in structure, (ii) modular (iii) with each module
running on a common algorithm (tandem algorithm) and (iv) selfsupervised. We
have actually built the architecture, developed the tandem algorithm of such a
hierarchical classifier and demonstrated it on an example problem."
"This paper describes a methodology for detecting anomalies from sequentially
observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach consists of two main
elements: (1) {\em filtering}, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each
successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy
observations, and (2) {\em hedging}, or flagging potential anomalies by
comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive
threshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an
end user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work
on online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions
given all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter
updates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models
which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which
yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and
slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same
exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides
with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game. We
also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step
relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all
estimated beliefs and feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic
data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high
dimensionality, as well as on the Enron email dataset."
"We present in this paper a study on the ability and the benefits of using a
keystroke dynamics authentication method for collaborative systems.
Authentication is a challenging issue in order to guarantee the security of use
of collaborative systems during the access control step. Many solutions exist
in the state of the art such as the use of one time passwords or smart-cards.
We focus in this paper on biometric based solutions that do not necessitate any
additional sensor. Keystroke dynamics is an interesting solution as it uses
only the keyboard and is invisible for users. Many methods have been published
in this field. We make a comparative study of many of them considering the
operational constraints of use for collaborative systems."
"This document describes concisely the ubiquitous class of exponential family
distributions met in statistics. The first part recalls definitions and
summarizes main properties and duality with Bregman divergences (all proofs are
skipped). The second part lists decompositions and related formula of common
exponential family distributions. We recall the Fisher-Rao-Riemannian
geometries and the dual affine connection information geometries of statistical
manifolds. It is intended to maintain and update this document and catalog by
adding new distribution items."
"One of the most popular algorithms for clustering in Euclidean space is the
$k$-means algorithm; $k$-means is difficult to analyze mathematically, and few
theoretical guarantees are known about it, particularly when the data is {\em
well-clustered}. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature
by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular,
we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian --
or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.
  We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption.
First, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical
Gaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the
subspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an
exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm,
when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical
Gaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation
between the mixture components.
  Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2
spherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required
by a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample
requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing
separation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we
show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures
of two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the
overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the
sample requirement of $k$-means is {\em near-optimal}."
"In this paper, we consider delay-optimal power and subcarrier allocation
design for OFDMA systems with $N_F$ subcarriers, $K$ mobiles and one base
station. There are $K$ queues at the base station for the downlink traffic to
the $K$ mobiles with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We
shall model the problem as a $K$-dimensional infinite horizon average reward
Markov Decision Problem (MDP) where the control actions are assumed to be a
function of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) as well as the
joint Queue State Information (QSI). This problem is challenging because it
corresponds to a stochastic Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem where
general solution is still unknown. We propose an {\em online stochastic value
iteration} solution using {\em stochastic approximation}. The proposed power
control algorithm, which is a function of both the CSI and the QSI, takes the
form of multi-level water-filling. We prove that under two mild conditions in
Theorem 1 (One is the stepsize condition. The other is the condition on
accessibility of the Markov Chain, which can be easily satisfied in most of the
cases we are interested.), the proposed solution converges to the optimal
solution almost surely (with probability 1) and the proposed framework offers a
possible solution to the general stochastic NUM problem. By exploiting the
birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we obtain a reduced complexity
decomposed solution with linear $\mathcal{O}(KN_F)$ complexity and
$\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory requirement."
"Association rule mining plays vital part in knowledge mining. The difficult
task is discovering knowledge or useful rules from the large number of rules
generated for reduced support. For pruning or grouping rules, several
techniques are used such as rule structure cover methods, informative cover
methods, rule clustering, etc. Another way of selecting association rules is
based on interestingness measures such as support, confidence, correlation, and
so on. In this paper, we study how rule clusters of the pattern Xi - Y are
distributed over different interestingness measures."
"This paper presents a tumor detection algorithm from mammogram. The proposed
system focuses on the solution of two problems. One is how to detect tumors as
suspicious regions with a very weak contrast to their background and another is
how to extract features which categorize tumors. The tumor detection method
follows the scheme of (a) mammogram enhancement. (b) The segmentation of the
tumor area. (c) The extraction of features from the segmented tumor area. (d)
The use of SVM classifier. The enhancement can be defined as conversion of the
image quality to a better and more understandable level. The mammogram
enhancement procedure includes filtering, top hat operation, DWT. Then the
contrast stretching is used to increase the contrast of the image. The
segmentation of mammogram images has been playing an important role to improve
the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The most common segmentation
method used is thresholding. The features are extracted from the segmented
breast area. Next stage include, which classifies the regions using the SVM
classifier. The method was tested on 75 mammographic images, from the mini-MIAS
database. The methodology achieved a sensitivity of 88.75%."
"Among all the partition based clustering algorithms K-means is the most
popular and well known method. It generally shows impressive results even in
considerably large data sets. The computational complexity of K-means does not
suffer from the size of the data set. The main disadvantage faced in performing
this clustering is that the selection of initial means. If the user does not
have adequate knowledge about the data set, it may lead to erroneous results.
The algorithm Automatic Initialization of Means (AIM), which is an extension to
K-means, has been proposed to overcome the problem of initial mean generation.
In this paper an attempt has been made to compare the performance of the
algorithms through implementation"
"Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is
expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem,
where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has
low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds
for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We
analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its
cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel
connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by
bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear
regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important
cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In
our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other
heuristical GP optimization approaches."
"The paper deals with on-line regression settings with signals belonging to a
Banach lattice. Our algorithms work in a semi-online setting where all the
inputs are known in advance and outcomes are unknown and given step by step. We
apply the Aggregating Algorithm to construct a prediction method whose
cumulative loss over all the input vectors is comparable with the cumulative
loss of any linear functional on the Banach lattice. As a by-product we get an
algorithm that takes signals from an arbitrary domain. Its cumulative loss is
comparable with the cumulative loss of any predictor function from Besov and
Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We describe several applications of our setting."
"The performance in higher secondary school education in India is a turning
point in the academic lives of all students. As this academic performance is
influenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining
model for students' performance so as to identify the slow learners and study
the influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. In the
present investigation, a survey cum experimental methodology was adopted to
generate a database and it was constructed from a primary and a secondary
source. While the primary data was collected from the regular students, the
secondary data was gathered from the school and office of the Chief Educational
Officer (CEO). A total of 1000 datasets of the year 2006 from five different
schools in three different districts of Tamilnadu were collected. The raw data
was preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in
one form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result,
we had 772 student records, which were used for CHAID prediction model
construction. A set of prediction rules were extracted from CHIAD prediction
model and the efficiency of the generated CHIAD prediction model was found. The
accuracy of the present model was compared with other model and it has been
found to be satisfactory."
"The recent increase in dimensionality of data has thrown a great challenge to
the existing dimensionality reduction methods in terms of their effectiveness.
Dimensionality reduction has emerged as one of the significant preprocessing
steps in machine learning applications and has been effective in removing
inappropriate data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving
comprehensibility. Feature redundancy exercises great influence on the
performance of classification process. Towards the better classification
performance, this paper addresses the usefulness of truncating the highly
correlated and redundant attributes. Here, an effort has been made to verify
the utility of dimensionality reduction by applying LVQ (Learning Vector
Quantization) method on two Benchmark datasets of 'Pima Indian Diabetic
patients' and 'Lung cancer patients'."
"A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in
order to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate
prediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many
applications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from
data, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks
solving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible,
and thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present
Distributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for
repeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility
of the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees
that apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural
diminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely
low communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We
extend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several real-world sensing
tasks."
"Recently Kutin and Niyogi investigated several notions of algorithmic
stability--a property of a learning map conceptually similar to
continuity--showing that training-stability is sufficient for consistency of
Empirical Risk Minimization while distribution-free CV-stability is necessary
and sufficient for having finite VC-dimension. This paper concerns a phase
transition in the training stability of ERM, conjectured by the same authors.
Kutin and Niyogi proved that ERM on finite hypothesis spaces containing a
unique risk minimizer has training stability that scales exponentially with
sample size, and conjectured that the existence of multiple risk minimizers
prevents even super-quadratic convergence. We prove this result for the
strictly weaker notion of CV-stability, positively resolving the conjecture."
"We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be
significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly. We
introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also
with non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the
(highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset."
"We introduce a natural generalization of submodular set cover and exact
active learning with a finite hypothesis class (query learning). We call this
new problem interactive submodular set cover. Applications include advertising
in social networks with hidden information. We give an approximation guarantee
for a novel greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which
matches up to constant factors. We also discuss negative results for simpler
approaches and present encouraging early experimental results."
"India is a multi-lingual country where Roman script is often used alongside
different Indic scripts in a text document. To develop a script specific
handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, it is therefore
necessary to identify the scripts of handwritten text correctly. In this paper,
we present a system, which automatically separates the scripts of handwritten
words from a document, written in Bangla or Devanagri mixed with Roman scripts.
In this script separation technique, we first, extract the text lines and words
from document pages using a script independent Neighboring Component Analysis
technique. Then we have designed a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based
classifier for script separation, trained with 8 different wordlevel holistic
features. Two equal sized datasets, one with Bangla and Roman scripts and the
other with Devanagri and Roman scripts, are prepared for the system evaluation.
On respective independent text samples, word-level script identification
accuracies of 99.29% and 98.43% are achieved."
"We address the problem of learning in an online, bandit setting where the
learner must repeatedly select among $K$ actions, but only receives partial
feedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a new
algorithm called Exp4.P, we show that it is possible to compete with the best
in a set of $N$ experts with probability $1-\delta$ while incurring regret at
most $O(\sqrt{KT\ln(N/\delta)})$ over $T$ time steps. The new algorithm is
tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new
algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of
VC-dimension $d$ while incurring regret at most $O(\sqrt{T(d\ln(T) + \ln
(1/\delta))})$ with probability $1-\delta$. These guarantees improve on those
of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment,
and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the
contextual bandit setting."
"We introduce a new online convex optimization algorithm that adaptively
chooses its regularization function based on the loss functions observed so
far. This is in contrast to previous algorithms that use a fixed regularization
function such as L2-squared, and modify it only via a single time-dependent
parameter. Our algorithm's regret bounds are worst-case optimal, and for
certain realistic classes of loss functions they are much better than existing
bounds. These bounds are problem-dependent, which means they can exploit the
structure of the actual problem instance. Critically, however, our algorithm
does not need to know this structure in advance. Rather, we prove competitive
guarantees that show the algorithm provides a bound within a constant factor of
the best possible bound (of a certain functional form) in hindsight."
"Semisupervised learning has emerged as a popular framework for improving
modeling accuracy while controlling labeling cost. Based on an extension of
stochastic composite likelihood we quantify the asymptotic accuracy of
generative semi-supervised learning. In doing so, we complement
distribution-free analysis by providing an alternative framework to measure the
value associated with different labeling policies and resolve the fundamental
question of how much data to label and in what manner. We demonstrate our
approach with both simulation studies and real world experiments using naive
Bayes for text classification and MRFs and CRFs for structured prediction in
NLP."
"Many popular linear classifiers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or
SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally,
these risk functions are computed based on a labeled dataset. We develop a
novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the
marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is
consistent on high-dimensional datasets and demonstrate it on synthetic and
real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating
classifiers in transfer learning, and for training classifiers with no labeled
data whatsoever."
"A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to automatically select the
""right"" model complexity, e.g., the number of neighbors to be averaged over in
k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree in regression with
polynomials. We suggest a novel principle - the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) -
for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss
rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better.
LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized
maximum likelihood variants (AIC, BIC, MDL), LoRP depends only on the
regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise
model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN."
"Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the
intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative
estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood
function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff
differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of
computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the
estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical
robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in
the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random fields. The
theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the
estimators when the computational resources are insufficient. They also
demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated
with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy."
"We present an approach to semi-supervised learning based on an exponential
family characterization. Our approach generalizes previous work on coupled
priors for hybrid generative/discriminative models. Our model is more flexible
and natural than previous approaches. Experimental results on several data sets
show that our approach also performs better in practice."
"In recent years, predicting the user's next request in web navigation has
received much attention. An information source to be used for dealing with such
problem is the left information by the previous web users stored at the web
access log on the web servers. Purposed systems for this problem work based on
this idea that if a large number of web users request specific pages of a
website on a given session, it can be concluded that these pages are satisfying
similar information needs, and therefore they are conceptually related. In this
study, a new clustering approach is introduced that employs logical path
storing of a website pages as another parameter which is regarded as a
similarity parameter and conceptual relation between web pages. The results of
simulation have shown that the proposed approach is more than others precise in
determining the clusters."
"Most Web page classification models typically apply the bag of words (BOW)
model to represent the feature space. The original BOW representation, however,
is unable to recognize semantic relationships between terms. One possible
solution is to apply the topic model approach based on the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation algorithm to cluster the term features into a set of latent topics.
Terms assigned into the same topic are semantically related. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical classification method based on a topic model and
by integrating additional term features from neighboring pages. Our
hierarchical classification method consists of two phases: (1) feature
representation by using a topic model and integrating neighboring pages, and
(2) hierarchical Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification model constructed
from a confusion matrix. From the experimental results, the approach of using
the proposed hierarchical SVM model by integrating current page with
neighboring pages via the topic model yielded the best performance with the
accuracy equal to 90.33% and the F1 measure of 90.14%; an improvement of 5.12%
and 5.13% over the original SVM model, respectively."
"We apply the method of defensive forecasting, based on the use of
game-theoretic supermartingales, to prediction with expert advice. In the
traditional setting of a countable number of experts and a finite number of
outcomes, the Defensive Forecasting Algorithm is very close to the well-known
Aggregating Algorithm. Not only the performance guarantees but also the
predictions are the same for these two methods of fundamentally different
nature. We discuss also a new setting where the experts can give advice
conditional on the learner's future decision. Both the algorithms can be
adapted to the new setting and give the same performance guarantees as in the
traditional setting. Finally, we outline an application of defensive
forecasting to a setting with several loss functions."
"We propose a novel problem formulation of learning a single task when the
data are provided in different feature spaces. Each such space is called an
outlook, and is assumed to contain both labeled and unlabeled data. The
objective is to take advantage of the data from all the outlooks to better
classify each of the outlooks. We devise an algorithm that computes optimal
affine mappings from different outlooks to a target outlook by matching moments
of the empirical distributions. We further derive a probabilistic
interpretation of the resulting algorithm and a sample complexity bound
indicating how many samples are needed to adequately find the mapping. We
report the results of extensive experiments on activity recognition tasks that
show the value of the proposed approach in boosting performance."
"In Bayesian machine learning, conjugate priors are popular, mostly due to
mathematical convenience. In this paper, we show that there are deeper reasons
for choosing a conjugate prior. Specifically, we formulate the conjugate prior
in the form of Bregman divergence and show that it is the inherent geometry of
conjugate priors that makes them appropriate and intuitive. This geometric
interpretation allows one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as
the {\it effective} sample points, thus providing additional intuition. We use
this geometric understanding of conjugate priors to derive the hyperparameters
and expression of the prior used to couple the generative and discriminative
components of a hybrid model for semi-supervised learning."
"In this paper, we consider the distributive queue-aware power and subband
allocation design for a delay-optimal OFDMA uplink system with one base
station, $K$ users and $N_F$ independent subbands. Each mobile has an uplink
queue with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We model the
problem as an infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP)
where the control actions are functions of the instantaneous Channel State
Information (CSI) as well as the joint Queue State Information (QSI). To
address the distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory
requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the subband allocation
Q-factor by the sum of the per-user subband allocation Q-factor and derive a
distributive online stochastic learning algorithm to estimate the per-user
Q-factor and the Lagrange multipliers (LM) simultaneously and determine the
control actions using an auction mechanism. We show that under the proposed
auction mechanism, the distributive online learning converges almost surely
(with probability 1). For illustration, we apply the proposed distributive
stochastic learning framework to an application example with exponential packet
size distribution. We show that the delay-optimal power control has the {\em
multi-level water-filling} structure where the CSI determines the instantaneous
power allocation and the QSI determines the water-level. The proposed algorithm
has linear signaling overhead and computational complexity $\mathcal O(KN)$,
which is desirable from an implementation perspective."
"This paper presents a method for automated healing as part of off-line
automated troubleshooting. The method combines statistical learning with
constraint optimization. The automated healing aims at locally optimizing radio
resource management (RRM) or system parameters of cells with poor performance
in an iterative manner. The statistical learning processes the data using
Logistic Regression (LR) to extract closed form (functional) relations between
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Radio Resource Management (RRM)
parameters. These functional relations are then processed by an optimization
engine which proposes new parameter values. The advantage of the proposed
formulation is the small number of iterations required by the automated healing
method to converge, making it suitable for off-line implementation. The
proposed method is applied to heal an Inter-Cell Interference Coordination
(ICIC) process in a 3G Long Term Evolution (LTE) network which is based on
soft-frequency reuse scheme. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of
the proposed approach."
"Although the real reproducing kernels are used in an increasing number of
machine learning problems, complex kernels have not, yet, been used, in spite
of their potential interest in applications such as communications. In this
work, we focus our attention on the complex gaussian kernel and its possible
application in the complex Kernel LMS algorithm. In order to derive the
gradients needed to develop the complex kernel LMS (CKLMS), we employ the
powerful tool of Wirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted much
attention in the signal processing community. Writinger's calculus simplifies
computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this
end, the notion of Writinger's calculus is extended to include complex RKHSs.
Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements
over the traditional complex LMS or Widely Linear complex LMS (WL-LMS)
algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."
"Over the last decade, kernel methods for nonlinear processing have
successfully been used in the machine learning community. However, so far, the
emphasis has been on batch techniques. It is only recently, that online
adaptive techniques have been considered in the context of signal processing
tasks. To the best of our knowledge, no kernel-based strategy has been
developed, so far, that is able to deal with complex valued signals. In this
paper, we take advantage of a technique called complexification of real RKHSs
to attack this problem. In order to derive gradients and subgradients of
operators that need to be defined on the associated complex RKHSs, we employ
the powerful tool ofWirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted much
attention in the signal processing community. Writinger's calculus simplifies
computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this
end, in this paper, the notion of Writinger's calculus is extended, for the
first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive the Complex Kernel
Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm. Experiments verify that the CKLMS can be
used to derive nonlinear stable algorithms, which offer significant performance
improvements over the traditional complex LMS orWidely Linear complex LMS
(WL-LMS) algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."
"Semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs) are a kind of popular
approaches which try to improve learning performance by exploiting unlabeled
data. Though S3VMs have been found helpful in many situations, they may
degenerate performance and the resultant generalization ability may be even
worse than using the labeled data only. In this paper, we try to reduce the
chance of performance degeneration of S3VMs. Our basic idea is that, rather
than exploiting all unlabeled data, the unlabeled instances should be selected
such that only the ones which are very likely to be helpful are exploited,
while some highly risky unlabeled instances are avoided. We propose the
S3VM-\emph{us} method by using hierarchical clustering to select the unlabeled
instances. Experiments on a broad range of data sets over eighty-eight
different settings show that the chance of performance degeneration of
S3VM-\emph{us} is much smaller than that of existing S3VMs."
"We study prediction with expert advice in the setting where the losses are
accumulated with some discounting---the impact of old losses may gradually
vanish. We generalize the Aggregating Algorithm and the Aggregating Algorithm
for Regression to this case, propose a suitable new variant of exponential
weights algorithm, and prove respective loss bounds."
"In this paper, we formulate a novel problem for finding blackhole and volcano
patterns in a large directed graph. Specifically, a blackhole pattern is a
group which is made of a set of nodes in a way such that there are only inlinks
to this group from the rest nodes in the graph. In contrast, a volcano pattern
is a group which only has outlinks to the rest nodes in the graph. Both
patterns can be observed in real world. For instance, in a trading network, a
blackhole pattern may represent a group of traders who are manipulating the
market. In the paper, we first prove that the blackhole mining problem is a
dual problem of finding volcanoes. Therefore, we focus on finding the blackhole
patterns. Along this line, we design two pruning schemes to guide the blackhole
finding process. In the first pruning scheme, we strategically prune the search
space based on a set of pattern-size-independent pruning rules and develop an
iBlackhole algorithm. The second pruning scheme follows a divide-and-conquer
strategy to further exploit the pruning results from the first pruning scheme.
Indeed, a target directed graphs can be divided into several disconnected
subgraphs by the first pruning scheme, and thus the blackhole finding can be
conducted in each disconnected subgraph rather than in a large graph. Based on
these two pruning schemes, we also develop an iBlackhole-DC algorithm. Finally,
experimental results on real-world data show that the iBlackhole-DC algorithm
can be several orders of magnitude faster than the iBlackhole algorithm, which
has a huge computational advantage over a brute-force method."
"We derive generalization bounds for learning algorithms based on their
robustness: the property that if a testing sample is ""similar"" to a training
sample, then the testing error is close to the training error. This provides a
novel approach, different from the complexity or stability arguments, to study
generalization of learning algorithms. We further show that a weak notion of
robustness is both sufficient and necessary for generalizability, which implies
that robustness is a fundamental property for learning algorithms to work."
"We study online learning when individual instances are corrupted by
adversarially chosen random noise. We assume the noise distribution is unknown,
and may change over time with no restriction other than having zero mean and
bounded variance. Our technique relies on a family of unbiased estimators for
non-linear functions, which may be of independent interest. We show that a
variant of online gradient descent can learn functions in any dot-product
(e.g., polynomial) or Gaussian kernel space with any analytic convex loss
function. Our variant uses randomized estimates that need to query a random
number of noisy copies of each instance, where with high probability this
number is upper bounded by a constant. Allowing such multiple queries cannot be
avoided: Indeed, we show that online learning is in general impossible when
only one noisy copy of each instance can be accessed."
"We consider the question of the stability of evolutionary algorithms to
gradual changes, or drift, in the target concept. We define an algorithm to be
resistant to drift if, for some inverse polynomial drift rate in the target
function, it converges to accuracy 1 -- \epsilon , with polynomial resources,
and then stays within that accuracy indefinitely, except with probability
\epsilon , at any one time. We show that every evolution algorithm, in the
sense of Valiant (2007; 2009), can be converted using the Correlational Query
technique of Feldman (2008), into such a drift resistant algorithm. For certain
evolutionary algorithms, such as for Boolean conjunctions, we give bounds on
the rates of drift that they can resist. We develop some new evolution
algorithms that are resistant to significant drift. In particular, we give an
algorithm for evolving linear separators over the spherically symmetric
distribution that is resistant to a drift rate of O(\epsilon /n), and another
algorithm over the more general product normal distributions that resists a
smaller drift rate.
  The above translation result can be also interpreted as one on the robustness
of the notion of evolvability itself under changes of definition. As a second
result in that direction we show that every evolution algorithm can be
converted to a quasi-monotonic one that can evolve from any starting point
without the performance ever dipping significantly below that of the starting
point. This permits the somewhat unnatural feature of arbitrary performance
degradations to be removed from several known robustness translations."
"We describe and analyze a new algorithm for agnostically learning
kernel-based halfspaces with respect to the \emph{zero-one} loss function.
Unlike most previous formulations which rely on surrogate convex loss functions
(e.g. hinge-loss in SVM and log-loss in logistic regression), we provide finite
time/sample guarantees with respect to the more natural zero-one loss function.
The proposed algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in worst-case time
$\poly(\exp(L\log(L/\epsilon)))$, for $\emph{any}$ distribution, where $L$ is a
Lipschitz constant (which can be thought of as the reciprocal of the margin),
and the learned classifier is worse than the optimal halfspace by at most
$\epsilon$. We also prove a hardness result, showing that under a certain
cryptographic assumption, no algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in
time polynomial in $L$."
"This paper provides a theoretical explanation on the clustering aspect of
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We prove that even without imposing
orthogonality nor sparsity constraint on the basis and/or coefficient matrix,
NMF still can give clustering results, thus providing a theoretical support for
many works, e.g., Xu et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2], that show the superiority
of the standard NMF as a clustering method."
"The sample complexity of active learning under the realizability assumption
has been well-studied. The realizability assumption, however, rarely holds in
practice. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the sample complexity of
active learning in the non-realizable case under multi-view setting. We prove
that, with unbounded Tsybakov noise, the sample complexity of multi-view active
learning can be $\widetilde{O}(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, contrasting to
single-view setting where the polynomial improvement is the best possible
achievement. We also prove that in general multi-view setting the sample
complexity of active learning with unbounded Tsybakov noise is
$\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, where the order of $1/\epsilon$ is
independent of the parameter in Tsybakov noise, contrasting to previous
polynomial bounds where the order of $1/\epsilon$ is related to the parameter
in Tsybakov noise."
"In the framework of prediction with expert advice, we consider a recently
introduced kind of regret bounds: the bounds that depend on the effective
instead of nominal number of experts. In contrast to the NormalHedge bound,
which mainly depends on the effective number of experts and also weakly depends
on the nominal one, we obtain a bound that does not contain the nominal number
of experts at all. We use the defensive forecasting method and introduce an
application of defensive forecasting to multivalued supermartingales."
"Exchangeable random variables form an important and well-studied
generalization of i.i.d. variables, however simple examples show that no
nontrivial concept or function classes are PAC learnable under general
exchangeable data inputs $X_1,X_2,\ldots$. Inspired by the work of Berti and
Rigo on a Glivenko--Cantelli theorem for exchangeable inputs, we propose a new
paradigm, adequate for learning from exchangeable data: predictive PAC
learnability. A learning rule $\mathcal L$ for a function class $\mathscr F$ is
predictive PAC if for every $\e,\delta>0$ and each function $f\in {\mathscr
F}$, whenever $\abs{\sigma}\geq s(\delta,\e)$, we have with confidence
$1-\delta$ that the expected difference between $f(X_{n+1})$ and the image of
$f\vert\sigma$ under $\mathcal L$ does not exceed $\e$ conditionally on
$X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$. Thus, instead of learning the function $f$ as such, we
are learning to a given accuracy $\e$ the predictive behaviour of $f$ at the
future points $X_i(\omega)$, $i>n$ of the sample path. Using de Finetti's
theorem, we show that if a universally separable function class $\mathscr F$ is
distribution-free PAC learnable under i.i.d. inputs, then it is
distribution-free predictive PAC learnable under exchangeable inputs, with a
slightly worse sample complexity."
"The paper addresses the problem of learning a regression model parameterized
by a fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrix. The focus is on the nonlinear
nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The
mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms
adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of fixed-rank
positive semidefinite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the
literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned
matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem
size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed
algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a
positive semidefinite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical
benchmarks."
"In dyadic prediction, labels must be predicted for pairs (dyads) whose
members possess unique identifiers and, sometimes, additional features called
side-information. Special cases of this problem include collaborative filtering
and link prediction. We present the first model for dyadic prediction that
satisfies several important desiderata: (i) labels may be ordinal or nominal,
(ii) side-information can be easily exploited if present, (iii) with or without
side-information, latent features are inferred for dyad members, (iv) it is
resistant to sample-selection bias, (v) it can learn well-calibrated
probabilities, and (vi) it can scale to very large datasets. To our knowledge,
no existing method satisfies all the above criteria. In particular, many
methods assume that the labels are ordinal and ignore side-information when it
is present. Experimental results show that the new method is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for the special cases of collaborative filtering and
link prediction, and that it makes accurate predictions on nominal data."
"We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works
without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a
restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and
only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space
approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness
associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial
improvements over supervised learning for classification."
"Over the last decade, kernel methods for nonlinear processing have
successfully been used in the machine learning community. The primary
mathematical tool employed in these methods is the notion of the Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space. However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch
techniques. It is only recently, that online techniques have been considered in
the context of adaptive signal processing tasks. Moreover, these efforts have
only been focussed on real valued data sequences. To the best of our knowledge,
no adaptive kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, for complex
valued signals. Furthermore, although the real reproducing kernels are used in
an increasing number of machine learning problems, complex kernels have not,
yet, been used, in spite of their potential interest in applications that deal
with complex signals, with Communications being a typical example. In this
paper, we present a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive
filtering of complex signals, using either real reproducing kernels, taking
advantage of a technique called \textit{complexification} of real RKHSs, or
complex reproducing kernels, highlighting the use of the complex gaussian
kernel. In order to derive gradients of operators that need to be defined on
the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's
Calculus, which has recently attracted attention in the signal processing
community. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Wirtinger's calculus is
extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive
several realizations of the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm.
Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements
over several linear and nonlinear algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."
"This paper studies the MINLIP estimator for the identification of Wiener
systems consisting of a sequence of a linear FIR dynamical model, and a
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) static function. Given $T$
observations, this algorithm boils down to solving a convex quadratic program
with $O(T)$ variables and inequality constraints, implementing an inference
technique which is based entirely on model complexity control. The resulting
estimates of the linear submodel are found to be almost consistent when no
noise is present in the data, under a condition of smoothness of the true
nonlinearity and local Persistency of Excitation (local PE) of the data. This
result is novel as it does not rely on classical tools as a 'linearization'
using a Taylor decomposition, nor exploits stochastic properties of the data.
It is indicated how to extend the method to cope with noisy data, and empirical
evidence contrasts performance of the estimator against other recently proposed
techniques."
"In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a necessary and
sufficient condition for distribution-free PAC learnability of a concept class
$\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the
domain $\Omega$. Clearly, finiteness of the classical Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension of $\mathscr C$ is a sufficient, but no longer necessary, condition.
Besides, learnability of $\mathscr C$ under non-atomic measures does not imply
the uniform Glivenko-Cantelli property with regard to non-atomic measures. Our
learnability criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter
$\VC({\mathscr C}\,{\mathrm{mod}}\,\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of
$\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by
``thickening up'' single points in the definition of VC dimension to
uncountable ``clusters''. Equivalently, $\VC(\mathscr C\modd\omega_1)\leq d$ if
and only if every countable subclass of $\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\leq d$
outside a countable subset of $\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed
as the classical VC dimension of $\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset
of a compactification of $\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions
on $\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA)."
"We propose a novel feature selection strategy to discover
language-independent acoustic features that tend to be responsible for emotions
regardless of languages, linguistics and other factors. Experimental results
suggest that the language-independent feature subset discovered yields the
performance comparable to the full feature set on various emotional speech
corpora."
"The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on
(predefined) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group
structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent
attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are
given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization
is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this
paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso
penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator
associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator
by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the
gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed
empirical evaluations using the breast cancer gene expression data set, which
consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental
results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
"This paper introduces an approach to Reinforcement Learning Algorithm by
comparing their immediate rewards using a variation of Q-Learning algorithm.
Unlike the conventional Q-Learning, the proposed algorithm compares current
reward with immediate reward of past move and work accordingly. Relative reward
based Q-learning is an approach towards interactive learning. Q-Learning is a
model free reinforcement learning method that used to learn the agents. It is
observed that under normal circumstances algorithm take more episodes to reach
optimal Q-value due to its normal reward or sometime negative reward. In this
new form of algorithm agents select only those actions which have a higher
immediate reward signal in comparison to previous one. The contribution of this
article is the presentation of new Q-Learning Algorithm in order to maximize
the performance of algorithm and reduce the number of episode required to reach
optimal Q-value. Effectiveness of proposed algorithm is simulated in a 20 x20
Grid world deterministic environment and the result for the two forms of
Q-Learning Algorithms is given."
"We study three families of online convex optimization algorithms:
follow-the-proximally-regularized-leader (FTRL-Proximal), regularized dual
averaging (RDA), and composite-objective mirror descent. We first prove
equivalence theorems that show all of these algorithms are instantiations of a
general FTRL update. This provides theoretical insight on previous experimental
observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent
algorithm handles L1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that RDA
is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that
FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds,
leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in
closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two,
and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.
  Our second contribution is a unified analysis which produces regret bounds
that match (up to logarithmic terms) or improve the best previously known
bounds. This analysis also extends these algorithms in two important ways: we
support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit
updates, which replace the subgradient approximation of the current loss
function with an exact optimization."
"We propose a novel hybrid loss for multiclass and structured prediction
problems that is a convex combination of log loss for Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) and a multiclass hinge loss for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We
provide a sufficient condition for when the hybrid loss is Fisher consistent
for classification. This condition depends on a measure of dominance between
labels - specifically, the gap in per observation probabilities between the
most likely labels. We also prove Fisher consistency is necessary for
parametric consistency when learning models such as CRFs.
  We demonstrate empirically that the hybrid loss typically performs as least
as well as - and often better than - both of its constituent losses on variety
of tasks. In doing so we also provide an empirical comparison of the efficacy
of probabilistic and margin based approaches to multiclass and structured
prediction and the effects of label dominance on these results."
"In this paper we present a new algorithm for learning oblique decision trees.
Most of the current decision tree algorithms rely on impurity measures to
assess the goodness of hyperplanes at each node while learning a decision tree
in a top-down fashion. These impurity measures do not properly capture the
geometric structures in the data. Motivated by this, our algorithm uses a
strategy to assess the hyperplanes in such a way that the geometric structure
in the data is taken into account. At each node of the decision tree, we find
the clustering hyperplanes for both the classes and use their angle bisectors
as the split rule at that node. We show through empirical studies that this
idea leads to small decision trees and better performance. We also present some
analysis to show that the angle bisectors of clustering hyperplanes that we use
as the split rules at each node, are solutions of an interesting optimization
problem and hence argue that this is a principled method of learning a decision
tree."
"Margin theory provides one of the most popular explanations to the success of
\texttt{AdaBoost}, where the central point lies in the recognition that
\textit{margin} is the key for characterizing the performance of
\texttt{AdaBoost}. This theory has been very influential, e.g., it has been
used to argue that \texttt{AdaBoost} usually does not overfit since it tends to
enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. Previously the
\textit{minimum margin bound} was established for \texttt{AdaBoost}, however,
\cite{Breiman1999} pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin does not
necessarily lead to a better generalization. Later, \cite{Reyzin:Schapire2006}
emphasized that the margin distribution rather than minimum margin is crucial
to the performance of \texttt{AdaBoost}. In this paper, we first present the
\textit{$k$th margin bound} and further study on its relationship to previous
work such as the minimum margin bound and Emargin bound. Then, we improve the
previous empirical Bernstein bounds
\citep{Maurer:Pontil2009,Audibert:Munos:Szepesvari2009}, and based on such
findings, we defend the margin-based explanation against Breiman's doubts by
proving a new generalization error bound that considers exactly the same
factors as \cite{Schapire:Freund:Bartlett:Lee1998} but is sharper than
\cite{Breiman1999}'s minimum margin bound. By incorporating factors such as
average margin and variance, we present a generalization error bound that is
heavily related to the whole margin distribution. We also provide margin
distribution bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite
VC-dimension space."
"In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for multiclass boosting
learning. In the literature, AdaBoost.MO and AdaBoost.ECC are the two
successful multiclass boosting algorithms, which can use binary weak learners.
We explicitly derive these two algorithms' Lagrange dual problems based on
their regularized loss functions. We show that the Lagrange dual formulations
enable us to design totally-corrective multiclass algorithms by using the
primal-dual optimization technique. Experiments on benchmark data sets suggest
that our multiclass boosting can achieve a comparable generalization capability
with state-of-the-art, but the convergence speed is much faster than stage-wise
gradient descent boosting. In other words, the new totally corrective
algorithms can maximize the margin more aggressively."
"We establish an excess risk bound of O(H R_n^2 + R_n \sqrt{H L*}) for
empirical risk minimization with an H-smooth loss function and a hypothesis
class with Rademacher complexity R_n, where L* is the best risk achievable by
the hypothesis class. For typical hypothesis classes where R_n = \sqrt{R/n},
this translates to a learning rate of O(RH/n) in the separable (L*=0) case and
O(RH/n + \sqrt{L^* RH/n}) more generally. We also provide similar guarantees
for online and stochastic convex optimization with a smooth non-negative
objective."
"Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas
including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm
regularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many
applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group
sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,
challenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization.
Existing work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they
cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an
efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the
L1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than
1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the
proposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our
theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why
EP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the
special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient
algorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."
"An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has
attracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various
machine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic
data modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An
important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational
bottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus
the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we
develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM
solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this
contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path
algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight
parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that
breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in
high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric
representation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation
in weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the
current affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at
intersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through
extensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed algorithm."
"Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes has become an increasingly
popular tool in the machine learning community. It is efficient and can be used
when very little is known about the objective function, making it popular in
expensive black-box optimization scenarios. It uses Bayesian methods to sample
the objective efficiently using an acquisition function which incorporates the
model's estimate of the objective and the uncertainty at any given point.
However, there are several different parameterized acquisition functions in the
literature, and it is often unclear which one to use. Instead of using a single
acquisition function, we adopt a portfolio of acquisition functions governed by
an online multi-armed bandit strategy. We propose several portfolio strategies,
the best of which we call GP-Hedge, and show that this method outperforms the
best individual acquisition function. We also provide a theoretical bound on
the algorithm's performance."
"We consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission of
delay-sensitive data (e.g. multimedia data) over a fading channel. Existing
research on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namely
power-control and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), or system-level
solutions based on dynamic power management (DPM); however, there is currently
no rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both
physical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimum
possible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence of
stochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. In this report,
we propose such a framework. We formulate the stochastic optimization problem
as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it online using reinforcement
learning. The advantages of the proposed online method are that (i) it does not
require a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics to
determine the jointly optimal power-control, AMC, and DPM policies; (ii) it
exploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to
be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and
(iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the
adaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcement
learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can
converge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learning
algorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitude
faster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms."
"We propose a focus of attention mechanism to speed up the Perceptron
algorithm. Focus of attention speeds up the Perceptron algorithm by lowering
the number of features evaluated throughout training and prediction. Whereas
the traditional Perceptron evaluates all the features of each example, the
Attentive Perceptron evaluates less features for easy to classify examples,
thereby achieving significant speedups and small losses in prediction accuracy.
Focus of attention allows the Attentive Perceptron to stop the evaluation of
features at any interim point and filter the example. This creates an attentive
filter which concentrates computation at examples that are hard to classify,
and quickly filters examples that are easy to classify."
"In this paper, we consider a queue-aware distributive resource control
algorithm for two-hop MIMO cooperative systems. We shall illustrate that relay
buffering is an effective way to reduce the intrinsic half-duplex penalty in
cooperative systems. The complex interactions of the queues at the source node
and the relays are modeled as an average-cost infinite horizon Markov Decision
Process (MDP). The traditional approach solving this MDP problem involves
centralized control with huge complexity. To obtain a distributive and low
complexity solution, we introduce a linear structure which approximates the
value function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value
functions. We derive a distributive two-stage two-winner auction-based control
policy which is a function of the local CSI and local QSI only. Furthermore, to
estimate the best fit approximation parameter, we propose a distributive online
stochastic learning algorithm using stochastic approximation theory. Finally,
we establish technical conditions for almost-sure convergence and show that
under heavy traffic, the proposed low complexity distributive control is global
optimal."
"To classify time series by nearest neighbors, we need to specify or learn one
or several distance measures. We consider variations of the Mahalanobis
distance measures which rely on the inverse covariance matrix of the data.
Unfortunately --- for time series data --- the covariance matrix has often low
rank. To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse, covariance
shrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these alternatives and
benchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin
Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis
distance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster. To get best
results with Mahalanobis distance measures, we recommend learning one distance
measure per class using either covariance shrinking or the diagonal approach."
"This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)
with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost
functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the
Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito
divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed
algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of
the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM)
algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard
heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The
monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1)
using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of
majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along
constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM.
Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the
ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be
adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty
function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF
(when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace)."
"Hardness results for maximum agreement problems have close connections to
hardness results for proper learning in computational learning theory. In this
paper we prove two hardness results for the problem of finding a low degree
polynomial threshold function (PTF) which has the maximum possible agreement
with a given set of labeled examples in $\R^n \times \{-1,1\}.$ We prove that
for any constants $d\geq 1, \eps > 0$,
  {itemize}
  Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, no polynomial-time algorithm can find a
degree-$d$ PTF that is consistent with a $(\half + \eps)$ fraction of a given
set of labeled examples in $\R^n \times \{-1,1\}$, even if there exists a
degree-$d$ PTF that is consistent with a $1-\eps$ fraction of the examples.
  It is $\NP$-hard to find a degree-2 PTF that is consistent with a $(\half +
\eps)$ fraction of a given set of labeled examples in $\R^n \times \{-1,1\}$,
even if there exists a halfspace (degree-1 PTF) that is consistent with a $1 -
\eps$ fraction of the examples.
  {itemize}
  These results immediately imply the following hardness of learning results:
(i) Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, there is no better-than-trivial
proper learning algorithm that agnostically learns degree-$d$ PTFs under
arbitrary distributions; (ii) There is no better-than-trivial learning
algorithm that outputs degree-2 PTFs and agnostically learns halfspaces (i.e.
degree-1 PTFs) under arbitrary distributions."
"A general framework based on Gaussian models and a MAP-EM algorithm is
introduced in this paper for solving matrix/table completion problems. The
numerical experiments with the standard and challenging movie ratings data show
that the proposed approach, based on probably one of the simplest probabilistic
models, leads to the results in the same ballpark as the state-of-the-art, at a
lower computational cost."
"This paper considers the clustering problem for large data sets. We propose
an approach based on distributed optimization. The clustering problem is
formulated as an optimization problem of maximizing the classification gain. We
show that the optimization problem can be reformulated and decomposed into
small-scale sub optimization problems by using the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition
method. Generally speaking, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can only be used for
convex optimization problems, where the duality gaps are zero. Even though, the
considered optimization problem in this paper is non-convex, we prove that the
duality gap goes to zero, as the problem size goes to infinity. Therefore, the
Dantzig-Wolfe method can be applied here. In the proposed approach, the
clustering problem is iteratively solved by a group of computers coordinated by
one center processor, where each computer solves one independent small-scale
sub optimization problem during each iteration, and only a small amount of data
communication is needed between the computers and center processor. Numerical
results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient."
"We give sublinear-time approximation algorithms for some optimization
problems arising in machine learning, such as training linear classifiers and
finding minimum enclosing balls. Our algorithms can be extended to some
kernelized versions of these problems, such as SVDD, hard margin SVM, and
L2-SVM, for which sublinear-time algorithms were not known before. These new
algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new
multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running
times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM
model. We also give implementations of our algorithms in the semi-streaming
setting, obtaining the first low pass polylogarithmic space and sublinear time
algorithms achieving arbitrary approximation factor."
"An important part of problems in statistical physics and computer science can
be expressed as the computation of marginal probabilities over a Markov Random
Field. The belief propagation algorithm, which is an exact procedure to compute
these marginals when the underlying graph is a tree, has gained its popularity
as an efficient way to approximate them in the more general case. In this
paper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much
attention in the literature, which is the effect of the normalization of the
messages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization
strategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this,
we express the necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability of a
fixed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the fixed
point. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and
the underlying Bethe Free Energy."
"We consider a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand
inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives according to a
Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by
the retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement
intensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is
not known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action
""on the fly"" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed
demand reactions.
  Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic
""learning-while-doing"" algorithm that only involves function value estimation
to achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of
shrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval
using a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate
of our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of
asymptotic ""regret"" (the relative loss comparing to the full information
optimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric
and non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a
customer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insight from this research is
that the values of information on both the parametric form of the demand
function as well as each customer's exact reservation price are less important
than prior literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be
better off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than
sequentially."
"This article presents a model which is capable of learning and abstracting
new concepts based on comparing observations and finding the resemblance
between the observations. In the model, the new observations are compared with
the templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the
first stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description
which is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is
inspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next,
the new observations are identified through comparing them with the
previously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The
comparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance.
The new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm
consecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the
objects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed
categories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing
templates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This
description is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a
dimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template
bears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that
dimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new
observation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the
experiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the
new polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible
through employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual
system. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation
results of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new
templates."
"Supervised learning is all about the ability to generalize knowledge.
Specifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training
data, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data
correctly. In order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design
the learner, so it will not overfit the training data. The later can is done
usually by adding a regularization term. The statistical learning theory
explains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the
complexity of the learned model. This explanation, however, is rather abstract
and does not have a geometric intuition. The generalization error of a
classifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations
of the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize
well. Indeed, Xu et al. [2009] have shown that the SVM formulation is
equivalent to a robust optimization (RO) formulation, in which an adversary
displaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined
radius. In this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing
each data point with a Gaussian cloud centered at the sample. Loss is evaluated
as the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. This setup fits
the fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. We
develop an RO framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the
noise. In our algorithm named GURU, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on
the noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative
considerations. Our experiments show that this framework performs as well as
SVM and even slightly better in some cases. Generalizations for Mercer kernels
and for the multiclass case are presented as well. We also show that our
framework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective
functions."
"We propose a new clustering technique that can be regarded as a numerical
method to compute the proximity gestalt. The method analyzes edge length
statistics in the MST of the dataset and provides an a contrario cluster
detection criterion. The approach is fully parametric on the chosen distance
and can detect arbitrarily shaped clusters. The method is also automatic, in
the sense that only a single parameter is left to the user. This parameter has
an intuitive interpretation as it controls the expected number of false
detections. We show that the iterative application of our method can (1)
provide robustness to noise and (2) solve a masking phenomenon in which a
highly populated and salient cluster dominates the scene and inhibits the
detection of less-populated, but still salient, clusters."
"A fundamental result of statistical learnig theory states that a concept
class is PAC learnable if and only if it is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class
if and only if the VC dimension of the class is finite. However, the theorem is
only valid under special assumptions of measurability of the class, in which
case the PAC learnability even becomes consistent. Otherwise, there is a
classical example, constructed under the Continuum Hypothesis by Dudley and
Durst and further adapted by Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth, of a
concept class of VC dimension one which is neither uniform Glivenko-Cantelli
nor consistently PAC learnable. We show that, rather surprisingly, under an
additional set-theoretic hypothesis which is much milder than the Continuum
Hypothesis (Martin's Axiom), PAC learnability is equivalent to finite VC
dimension for every concept class."
"Q-learning is a reliable but inefficient off-policy temporal-difference
method, backing up reward only one step at a time. Replacing traces, using a
recency heuristic, are more efficient but less reliable. In this work, we
introduce model-free, off-policy temporal difference methods that make better
use of experience than Watkins' Q(\lambda). We introduce both Optimistic
Q(\lambda) and the temporal second difference trace (TSDT). TSDT is
particularly powerful in deterministic domains. TSDT uses neither recency nor
frequency heuristics, storing (s,a,r,s',\delta) so that off-policy updates can
be performed after apparently suboptimal actions have been taken. There are
additional advantages when using state abstraction, as in MAXQ. We demonstrate
that TSDT does significantly better than both Q-learning and Watkins'
Q(\lambda) in a deterministic cliff-walking domain. Results in a noisy
cliff-walking domain are less advantageous for TSDT, but demonstrate the
efficacy of Optimistic Q(\lambda), a replacing trace with some of the
advantages of TSDT."
"In experimenting with off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods in
hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) systems, we have observed unwanted
on-policy learning under reproducible conditions. Here we present modifications
to several TD methods that prevent unintentional on-policy learning from
occurring. These modifications create a tension between exploration and
learning. Traditional TD methods require commitment to finishing subtasks
without exploration in order to update Q-values for early actions with high
probability. One-step intra-option learning and temporal second difference
traces (TSDT) do not suffer from this limitation. We demonstrate that our HRL
system is efficient without commitment to completion of subtasks in a
cliff-walking domain, contrary to a widespread claim in the literature that it
is critical for efficiency of learning. Furthermore, decreasing commitment as
exploration progresses is shown to improve both online performance and the
resultant policy in the taxicab domain, opening a new avenue for research into
when it is more beneficial to continue with the current subtask or to replan."
"In this paper we present methods for attacking and defending $k$-gram
statistical analysis techniques that are used, for example, in network traffic
analysis and covert channel detection. The main new result is our demonstration
of how to use a behavior's or process' $k$-order statistics to build a
stochastic process that has those same $k$-order stationary statistics but
possesses different, deliberately designed, $(k+1)$-order statistics if
desired. Such a model realizes a ""complexification"" of the process or behavior
which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the
behavior. By deliberately introducing designed $(k+1)$-order behaviors, the
defender can check to see if those behaviors are present in the data. We also
develop constructs for source codes that respect the $k$-order statistics of a
process while encoding covert information. One fundamental consequence of these
results is that certain types of behavior analyses techniques come down to an
{\em arms race} in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more
computing resources applied to the problem."
"Given a set $F$ of $n$ positive functions over a ground set $X$, we consider
the problem of computing $x^*$ that minimizes the expression $\sum_{f\in
F}f(x)$, over $x\in X$. A typical application is \emph{shape fitting}, where we
wish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from
a (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point $p\in P$
corresponds to a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to $x$,
and we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in
$P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each $x\in X$ is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and
$f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.
  Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\em coresets} and
{\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our
results, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of
$\varepsilon$-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension,
to the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are
some kind of ""compressed representation"" of the input set $F$. Using
traditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time
approximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be
computed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only
polylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).
  We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances
(as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic
constructions."
"The main principle of stacked generalization (or Stacking) is using a
second-level generalizer to combine the outputs of base classifiers in an
ensemble. In this paper, we investigate different combination types under the
stacking framework; namely weighted sum (WS), class-dependent weighted sum
(CWS) and linear stacked generalization (LSG). For learning the weights, we
propose using regularized empirical risk minimization with the hinge loss. In
addition, we propose using group sparsity for regularization to facilitate
classifier selection. We performed experiments using two different ensemble
setups with differing diversities on 8 real-world datasets. Results show the
power of regularized learning with the hinge loss function. Using sparse
regularization, we are able to reduce the number of selected classifiers of the
diverse ensemble without sacrificing accuracy. With the non-diverse ensembles,
we even gain accuracy on average by using sparse regularization."
"This paper introduces a machine learning based collaborative multi-band
spectrum sensing policy for cognitive radios. The proposed sensing policy
guides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those
frequencies that persistently provide them high data rate. The proposed policy
is based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and
spatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic
modeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time.
Energy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per
each subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important
to control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary
transmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary
user. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy
improves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the
energy efficiency while controlling the miss detection probability."
"This paper considers the problem of learning, from samples, the dependency
structure of a system of linear stochastic differential equations, when some of
the variables are latent. In particular, we observe the time evolution of some
variables, and never observe other variables; from this, we would like to find
the dependency structure between the observed variables - separating out the
spurious interactions caused by the (marginalizing out of the) latent
variables' time series. We develop a new method, based on convex optimization,
to do so in the case when the number of latent variables is smaller than the
number of observed ones. For the case when the dependency structure between the
observed variables is sparse, we theoretically establish a high-dimensional
scaling result for structure recovery. We verify our theoretical result with
both synthetic and real data (from the stock market)."
"Estimator algorithms in learning automata are useful tools for adaptive,
real-time optimization in computer science and engineering applications. This
paper investigates theoretical convergence properties for a special case of
estimator algorithms: the pursuit learning algorithm. In this note, we identify
and fill a gap in existing proofs of probabilistic convergence for pursuit
learning. It is tradition to take the pursuit learning tuning parameter to be
fixed in practical applications, but our proof sheds light on the importance of
a vanishing sequence of tuning parameters in a theoretical convergence
analysis."
"One of the major challenges of ECoG-based Brain-Machine Interfaces is the
movement prediction of a human subject. Several methods exist to predict an arm
2-D trajectory. The fourth BCI Competition gives a dataset in which the aim is
to predict individual finger movements (5-D trajectory). The difficulty lies in
the fact that there is no simple relation between ECoG signals and finger
movement. We propose in this paper to decode finger flexions using switching
models. This method permits to simplify the system as it is now described as an
ensemble of linear models depending on an internal state. We show that an
interesting accuracy prediction can be obtained by such a model."
"Signal Sequence Labeling consists in predicting a sequence of labels given an
observed sequence of samples. A naive way is to filter the signal in order to
reduce the noise and to apply a classification algorithm on the filtered
samples. We propose in this paper to jointly learn the filter with the
classifier leading to a large margin filtering for classification. This method
allows to learn the optimal cutoff frequency and phase of the filter that may
be different from zero. Two methods are proposed and tested on a toy dataset
and on a real life BCI dataset from BCI Competition III."
"This paper addresses the pattern classification problem arising when
available target data include some uncertainty information. Target data
considered here is either qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an
estimation of the posterior probability). Our main contribution is a SVM
inspired formulation of this problem allowing to take into account class label
through a hinge loss as well as probability estimates using epsilon-insensitive
cost function together with a minimum norm (maximum margin) objective. This
formulation shows a dual form leading to a quadratic problem and allows the use
of a representer theorem and associated kernel. The solution provided can be
used for both decision and posterior probability estimation. Based on empirical
evidence our method outperforms regular SVM in terms of probability predictions
and classification performances."
"Motivated by the amount of code that goes unidentified on the web, we
introduce a practical method for algorithmically identifying the programming
language of source code. Our work is based on supervised learning and
intelligent statistical features. We also explored, but abandoned, a
grammatical approach. In testing, our implementation greatly outperforms that
of an existing tool that relies on a Bayesian classifier. Code is written in
Python and available under an MIT license."
"Mini-batch algorithms have been proposed as a way to speed-up stochastic
convex optimization problems. We study how such algorithms can be improved
using accelerated gradient methods. We provide a novel analysis, which shows
how standard gradient methods may sometimes be insufficient to obtain a
significant speed-up and propose a novel accelerated gradient algorithm, which
deals with this deficiency, enjoys a uniformly superior guarantee and works
well in practice."
"Shaping has proven to be a powerful but precarious means of improving
reinforcement learning performance. Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999) proposed the
potential-based shaping algorithm for adding shaping rewards in a way that
guarantees the learner will learn optimal behavior. In this note, we prove
certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step
required for several reinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, we
prove that a reinforcement learner with initial Q-values based on the shaping
algorithm's potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a
learner receiving potential-based shaping rewards. We further prove that under
a broad category of policies, the behavior of these two learners are
indistinguishable. The comparison provides intuition on the theoretical
properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler
method for capturing the algorithm's benefit. In addition, the equivalence
raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the efficiency of learning with
potential-based shaping."
"We present IBSEAD or distributed autonomous entity systems based Interaction
- a learning algorithm for the computer to self-evolve in a self-obsessed
manner. This learning algorithm will present the computer to look at the
internal and external environment in series of independent entities, which will
interact with each other, with and/or without knowledge of the computer's
brain. When a learning algorithm interacts, it does so by detecting and
understanding the entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with
this approach is that the algorithm does not consider the interaction of the
third party or unknown entities, which may be interacting with each other.
These unknown entities in their interaction with the non-computer entities make
an effect in the environment that influences the information and the behaviour
of the computer brain. Such details and the ability to process the dynamic and
unsettling nature of these interactions are absent in the current learning
algorithm such as the decision tree learning algorithm. IBSEAD is able to
evaluate and consider such algorithms and thus give us a better accuracy in
simulation of the highly evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as
dreams, imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully simulated
by the existing learning algorithms. Also, Hidden Markov models (HMM) are
useful in finding ""hidden"" entities, which may be known or unknown. However,
this model fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe unclear
or unknown. IBSEAD is better because it considers three types of entities-
known, unknown and invisible. We present our case with a comparison of existing
algorithms in known environments and cases and present the results of the
experiments using dry run of the simulated runs of the existing machine
learning algorithms versus IBSEAD."
"In this paper, we correct an upper bound, presented in~\cite{hs-11}, on the
generalisation error of classifiers learned through multiple kernel learning.
The bound in~\cite{hs-11} uses Rademacher complexity and has an\emph{additive}
dependence on the logarithm of the number of kernels and the margin achieved by
the classifier. However, there are some errors in parts of the proof which are
corrected in this paper. Unfortunately, the final result turns out to be a risk
bound which has a \emph{multiplicative} dependence on the logarithm of the
number of kernels and the margin achieved by the classifier."
"Detecting changes in high-dimensional time series is difficult because it
involves the comparison of probability densities that need to be estimated from
finite samples. In this paper, we present the first feature extraction method
tailored to change point detection, which is based on an extended version of
Stationary Subspace Analysis. We reduce the dimensionality of the data to the
most non-stationary directions, which are most informative for detecting state
changes in the time series. In extensive simulations on synthetic data we show
that the accuracy of three change point detection algorithms is significantly
increased by a prior feature extraction step. These findings are confirmed in
an application to industrial fault monitoring."
"We consider the most common variants of linear regression, including Ridge,
Lasso and Support-vector regression, in a setting where the learner is allowed
to observe only a fixed number of attributes of each example at training time.
We present simple and efficient algorithms for these problems: for Lasso and
Ridge regression they need the same total number of attributes (up to
constants) as do full-information algorithms, for reaching a certain accuracy.
For Support-vector regression, we require exponentially less attributes
compared to the state of the art. By that, we resolve an open problem recently
posed by Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2010). Experiments show the theoretical bounds to
be justified by superior performance compared to the state of the art."
"We consider online learning in partial-monitoring games against an oblivious
adversary. We show that when the number of actions available to the learner is
two and the game is nontrivial then it is reducible to a bandit-like game and
thus the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$."
"Kernel density estimation, a.k.a. Parzen windows, is a popular density
estimation method, which can be used for outlier detection or clustering. With
multivariate data, its performance is heavily reliant on the metric used within
the kernel. Most earlier work has focused on learning only the bandwidth of the
kernel (i.e., a scalar multiplicative factor). In this paper, we propose to
learn a full Euclidean metric through an expectation-minimization (EM)
procedure, which can be seen as an unsupervised counterpart to neighbourhood
component analysis (NCA). In order to avoid overfitting with a fully
nonparametric density estimator in high dimensions, we also consider a
semi-parametric Gaussian-Parzen density model, where some of the variables are
modelled through a jointly Gaussian density, while others are modelled through
Parzen windows. For these two models, EM leads to simple closed-form updates
based on matrix inversions and eigenvalue decompositions. We show empirically
that our method leads to density estimators with higher test-likelihoods than
natural competing methods, and that the metrics may be used within most
unsupervised learning techniques that rely on such metrics, such as spectral
clustering or manifold learning methods. Finally, we present a stochastic
approximation scheme which allows for the use of this method in a large-scale
setting."
"One of the most prominent challenges in clustering is ""the user's dilemma,""
which is the problem of selecting an appropriate clustering algorithm for a
specific task. A formal approach for addressing this problem relies on the
identification of succinct, user-friendly properties that formally capture when
certain clustering methods are preferred over others.
  Until now these properties focused on advantages of classical Linkage-Based
algorithms, failing to identify when other clustering paradigms, such as
popular center-based methods, are preferable. We present surprisingly simple
new properties that delineate the differences between common clustering
paradigms, which clearly and formally demonstrates advantages of center-based
approaches for some applications. These properties address how sensitive
algorithms are to changes in element frequencies, which we capture in a
generalized setting where every element is associated with a real-valued
weight."
"There has been increased interest in devising learning techniques that
combine unlabeled data with labeled data ? i.e. semi-supervised learning.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed across
various techniques and different types and amounts of labeled and unlabeled
data. Moreover, most of the published work on semi-supervised learning
techniques assumes that the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same
distribution. It is possible for the labeling process to be associated with a
selection bias such that the distributions of data points in the labeled and
unlabeled sets are different. Not correcting for such bias can result in biased
function approximation with potentially poor performance. In this paper, we
present an empirical study of various semi-supervised learning techniques on a
variety of datasets. We attempt to answer various questions such as the effect
of independence or relevance amongst features, the effect of the size of the
labeled and unlabeled sets and the effect of noise. We also investigate the
impact of sample-selection bias on the semi-supervised learning techniques
under study and implement a bivariate probit technique particularly designed to
correct for such bias."
"The paper studies machine learning problems where each example is described
using a set of Boolean features and where hypotheses are represented by linear
threshold elements. One method of increasing the expressiveness of learned
hypotheses in this context is to expand the feature set to include conjunctions
of basic features. This can be done explicitly or where possible by using a
kernel function. Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms,
the paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with
which the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the
generalization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first
describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of
conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to
efficiently run the Perceptron algorithm over a feature space of exponentially
many conjunctions; however we also show that using such kernels, the Perceptron
algorithm can provably make an exponential number of mistakes even when
learning simple functions. We then consider the question of whether kernel
functions can analogously be used to run the multiplicative-update Winnow
algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions.
Known upper bounds imply that the Winnow algorithm can learn Disjunctive Normal
Form (DNF) formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting. However,
we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnows behavior for
learning DNF over such a feature set. This implies that the kernel functions
which correspond to running Winnow for this problem are not efficiently
computable, and that there is no general construction that can run Winnow with
kernels."
"In this paper, we consider Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with error
states. Error states are those states entering which is undesirable or
dangerous. We define the risk with respect to a policy as the probability of
entering such a state when the policy is pursued. We consider the problem of
finding good policies whose risk is smaller than some user-specified threshold,
and formalize it as a constrained MDP with two criteria. The first criterion
corresponds to the value function originally given. We will show that the risk
can be formulated as a second criterion function based on a cumulative return,
whose definition is independent of the original value function. We present a
model free, heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm that aims at finding
good deterministic policies. It is based on weighting the original value
function and the risk. The weight parameter is adapted in order to find a
feasible solution for the constrained problem that has a good performance with
respect to the value function. The algorithm was successfully applied to the
control of a feed tank with stochastic inflows that lies upstream of a
distillation column. This control task was originally formulated as an optimal
control problem with chance constraints, and it was solved under certain
assumptions on the model to obtain an optimal solution. The power of our
learning algorithm is that it can be used even when some of these restrictive
assumptions are relaxed."
"We consider a bandit problem over a graph where the rewards are not directly
observed. Instead, the decision maker can compare two nodes and receive
(stochastic) information pertaining to the difference in their value. The graph
structure describes the set of possible comparisons. Consequently, comparing
between two nodes that are relatively far requires estimating the difference
between every pair of nodes on the path between them. We analyze this problem
from the perspective of sample complexity: How many queries are needed to find
an approximately optimal node with probability more than $1-\delta$ in the PAC
setup? We show that the topology of the graph plays a crucial in defining the
sample complexity: graphs with a low diameter have a much better sample
complexity."
"User profiling is a useful primitive for constructing personalised services,
such as content recommendation. In the present paper we investigate the
feasibility of user profiling in a distributed setting, with no central
authority and only local information exchanges between users. We compute a
profile vector for each user (i.e., a low-dimensional vector that characterises
her taste) via spectral transformation of observed user-produced ratings for
items. Our two main contributions follow: i) We consider a low-rank
probabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users
and items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and
items within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without
prior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random
observed ratings (namely $O(N\log N)$ such ratings for $N$ users), we can
predict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a
local vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide
empirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling
performance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are
performed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We
develop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users
into a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation. These involve
simple message passing among users, and provably converge to the desired
embedding. Our method essentially relies on a novel combination of gossiping
and the algorithm proposed by Oja and Karhunen."
"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model
for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and
touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and
computational biology. This paper represents LDA as a factor graph within the
Markov random field (MRF) framework, which enables the classic loopy belief
propagation (BP) algorithm for approximate inference and parameter estimation.
Although two commonly-used approximate inference methods, such as variational
Bayes (VB) and collapsed Gibbs sampling (GS), have gained great successes in
learning LDA, the proposed BP is competitive in both speed and accuracy as
validated by encouraging experimental results on four large-scale document data
sets. Furthermore, the BP algorithm has the potential to become a generic
learning scheme for variants of LDA-based topic models. To this end, we show
how to learn two typical variants of LDA-based topic models, such as
author-topic models (ATM) and relational topic models (RTM), using BP based on
the factor graph representation."
"In machine learning, distance-based algorithms, and other approaches, use
information that is represented by propositional data. However, this kind of
representation can be quite restrictive and, in many cases, it requires more
complex structures in order to represent data in a more natural way. Terms are
the basis for functional and logic programming representation. Distances
between terms are a useful tool not only to compare terms, but also to
determine the search space in many of these applications. This dissertation
applies distances between terms, exploiting the features of each distance and
the possibility to compare from propositional data types to hierarchical
representations. The distances between terms are applied through the k-NN
(k-nearest neighbor) classification algorithm using XML as a common language
representation. To be able to represent these data in an XML structure and to
take advantage of the benefits of distance between terms, it is necessary to
apply some transformations. These transformations allow the conversion of flat
data into hierarchical data represented in XML, using some techniques based on
intuitive associations between the names and values of variables and
associations based on attribute similarity.
  Several experiments with the distances between terms of Nienhuys-Cheng and
Estruch et al. were performed. In the case of originally propositional data,
these distances are compared to the Euclidean distance. In all cases, the
experiments were performed with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor
algorithm, using several exponents for the attraction function (weighted
distance). It can be seen that in some cases, the term distances can
significantly improve the results on approaches applied to flat
representations."
"In this paper we explore noise tolerant learning of classifiers. We formulate
the problem as follows. We assume that there is an ${\bf unobservable}$
training set which is noise-free. The actual training set given to the learning
algorithm is obtained from this ideal data set by corrupting the class label of
each example. The probability that the class label of an example is corrupted
is a function of the feature vector of the example. This would account for most
kinds of noisy data one encounters in practice. We say that a learning method
is noise tolerant if the classifiers learnt with the ideal noise-free data and
with noisy data, both have the same classification accuracy on the noise-free
data. In this paper we analyze the noise tolerance properties of risk
minimization (under different loss functions), which is a generic method for
learning classifiers. We show that risk minimization under 0-1 loss function
has impressive noise tolerance properties and that under squared error loss is
tolerant only to uniform noise; risk minimization under other loss functions is
not noise tolerant. We conclude the paper with some discussion on implications
of these theoretical results."
"Active learners alleviate the burden of labeling large amounts of data by
detecting and asking the user to label only the most informative examples in
the domain. We focus here on active learning for multi-view domains, in which
there are several disjoint subsets of features (views), each of which is
sufficient to learn the target concept. In this paper we make several
contributions. First, we introduce Co-Testing, which is the first approach to
multi-view active learning. Second, we extend the multi-view learning framework
by also exploiting weak views, which are adequate only for learning a concept
that is more general/specific than the target concept. Finally, we empirically
show that Co-Testing outperforms existing active learners on a variety of real
world domains such as wrapper induction, Web page classification, advertisement
removal, and discourse tree parsing."
"Recently, a unified framework for adaptive kernel based signal processing of
complex data was presented by the authors, which, besides offering techniques
to map the input data to complex Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, developed a
suitable Wirtinger-like Calculus for general Hilbert Spaces. In this short
paper, the extended Wirtinger's calculus is adopted to derive complex
kernel-based widely-linear estimation filters. Furthermore, we illuminate
several important characteristics of the widely linear filters. We show that,
although in many cases the gains from adopting widely linear estimation
filters, as alternatives to ordinary linear ones, are rudimentary, for the case
of kernel based widely linear filters significant performance improvements can
be obtained."
"Matrix factorization from a small number of observed entries has recently
garnered much attention as the key ingredient of successful recommendation
systems. One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to
handle changing user preferences over time. Recent proposals to address this
issue are heuristic in nature and do not fully exploit the time-dependent
structure of the problem. As a principled and general temporal formulation, we
propose a dynamical state space model of matrix factorization. Our proposal
builds upon probabilistic matrix factorization, a Bayesian model with Gaussian
priors. We utilize results in state tracking, such as the Kalman filter, to
provide accurate recommendations in the presence of both process and
measurement noise. We show how system parameters can be learned via
expectation-maximization and provide comparisons to current published
techniques."
"The disagreement coefficient of Hanneke has become a central data independent
invariant in proving active learning rates. It has been shown in various ways
that a concept class with low complexity together with a bound on the
disagreement coefficient at an optimal solution allows active learning rates
that are superior to passive learning ones.
  We present a different tool for pool based active learning which follows from
the existence of a certain uniform version of low disagreement coefficient, but
is not equivalent to it. In fact, we present two fundamental active learning
problems of significant interest for which our approach allows nontrivial
active learning bounds. However, any general purpose method relying on the
disagreement coefficient bounds only fails to guarantee any useful bounds for
these problems.
  The tool we use is based on the learner's ability to compute an estimator of
the difference between the loss of any hypotheses and some fixed ""pivotal""
hypothesis to within an absolute error of at most $\eps$ times the"
"The analysis of physiological processes over time are often given by
spectrometric or gene expression profiles over time with only few time points
but a large number of measured variables. The analysis of such temporal
sequences is challenging and only few methods have been proposed. The
information can be encoded time independent, by means of classical expression
differences for a single time point or in expression profiles over time.
Available methods are limited to unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The
predictive variables can be identified only by means of wrapper or
post-processing techniques. This is complicated due to the small number of
samples for such studies. Here, we present a supervised learning approach,
termed Supervised Topographic Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). It learns a
supervised mapping of the temporal sequences onto a low dimensional grid. We
utilize a hidden markov model (HMM) to account for the time domain and
relevance learning to identify the relevant feature dimensions most predictive
over time. The learned mapping can be used to visualize the temporal sequences
and to predict the class of a new sequence. The relevance learning permits the
identification of discriminating masses or gen expressions and prunes
dimensions which are unnecessary for the classification task or encode mainly
noise. In this way we obtain a very efficient learning system for temporal
sequences. The results indicate that using simultaneous supervised learning and
metric adaptation significantly improves the prediction accuracy for
synthetically and real life data in comparison to the standard techniques. The
discriminating features, identified by relevance learning, compare favorably
with the results of alternative methods. Our method permits the visualization
of the data on a low dimensional grid, highlighting the observed temporal
structure."
"Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms try to optimize an unknown function
that is expensive to evaluate using minimum number of evaluations/experiments.
Most of the proposed algorithms in BO are sequential, where only one experiment
is selected at each iteration. This method can be time inefficient when each
experiment takes a long time and more than one experiment can be ran
concurrently. On the other hand, requesting a fix-sized batch of experiments at
each iteration causes performance inefficiency in BO compared to the sequential
policies. In this paper, we present an algorithm that asks a batch of
experiments at each time step t where the batch size p_t is dynamically
determined in each step. Our algorithm is based on the observation that the
sequence of experiments selected by the sequential policy can sometimes be
almost independent from each other. Our algorithm identifies such scenarios and
request those experiments at the same time without degrading the performance.
We evaluate our proposed method using the Expected Improvement policy and the
results show substantial speedup with little impact on the performance in eight
real and synthetic benchmarks."
"This report considers how to inject external candidate solutions into the
CMA-ES algorithm. The injected solutions might stem from a gradient or a Newton
step, a surrogate model optimizer or any other oracle or search mechanism. They
can also be the result of a repair mechanism, for example to render infeasible
solutions feasible. Only small modifications to the CMA-ES are necessary to
turn injection into a reliable and effective method: too long steps need to be
tightly renormalized. The main objective of this report is to reveal this
simple mechanism. Depending on the source of the injected solutions,
interesting variants of CMA-ES arise. When the best-ever solution is always
(re-)injected, an elitist variant of CMA-ES with weighted multi-recombination
arises. When \emph{all} solutions are injected from an \emph{external} source,
the resulting algorithm might be viewed as \emph{adaptive encoding} with
step-size control. In first experiments, injected solutions of very good
quality lead to a convergence speed twice as fast as on the (simple) sphere
function without injection. This means that we observe an impressive speed-up
on otherwise difficult to solve functions. Single bad injected solutions on the
other hand do no significant harm."
"We propose a method to efficiently construct data-dependent kernels which can
make use of large quantities of (unlabeled) data. Our construction makes an
approximation in the standard construction of semi-supervised kernels in
Sindhwani et al. 2005. In typical cases these kernels can be computed in
nearly-linear time (in the amount of data), improving on the cubic time of the
standard construction, enabling large scale semi-supervised learning in a
variety of contexts. The methods are validated on semi-supervised and
unsupervised problems on data sets containing upto 64,000 sample points."
"Recent work in signal processing and statistics have focused on defining new
regularization functions, which not only induce sparsity of the solution, but
also take into account the structure of the problem. We present in this paper a
class of convex penalties introduced in the machine learning community, which
take the form of a sum of l_2 and l_infinity-norms over groups of variables.
They extend the classical group-sparsity regularization in the sense that the
groups possibly overlap, allowing more flexibility in the group design. We
review efficient optimization methods to deal with the corresponding inverse
problems, and their application to the problem of learning dictionaries of
natural image patches: On the one hand, dictionary learning has indeed proven
effective for various signal processing tasks. On the other hand, structured
sparsity provides a natural framework for modeling dependencies between
dictionary elements. We thus consider a structured sparse regularization to
learn dictionaries embedded in a particular structure, for instance a tree or a
two-dimensional grid. In the latter case, the results we obtain are similar to
the dictionaries produced by topographic independent component analysis."
"In this paper, we describe our approach to the Wikipedia Participation
Challenge which aims to predict the number of edits a Wikipedia editor will
make in the next 5 months. The best submission from our team, ""zeditor"",
achieved 41.7% improvement over WMF's baseline predictive model and the final
rank of 3rd place among 96 teams. An interesting characteristic of our approach
is that only temporal dynamics features (i.e., how the number of edits changes
in recent periods, etc.) are used in a self-supervised learning framework,
which makes it easy to be generalised to other application domains."
"This paper presents a method of choosing number of states of a HMM based on
number of critical points of the motion capture data. The choice of Hidden
Markov Models(HMM) parameters is crucial for recognizer's performance as it is
the first step of the training and cannot be corrected automatically within
HMM. In this article we define predictor of number of states based on number of
critical points of the sequence and test its effectiveness against sample data."
"We develop a new tool for data-dependent analysis of the
exploration-exploitation trade-off in learning under limited feedback. Our tool
is based on two main ingredients. The first ingredient is a new concentration
inequality that makes it possible to control the concentration of weighted
averages of multiple (possibly uncountably many) simultaneously evolving and
interdependent martingales. The second ingredient is an application of this
inequality to the exploration-exploitation trade-off via importance weighted
sampling. We apply the new tool to the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem,
however, the main importance of this paper is the development and understanding
of the new tool rather than improvement of existing algorithms for stochastic
multiarmed bandits. In the follow-up work we demonstrate that the new tool can
improve over state-of-the-art in structurally richer problems, such as
stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (Seldin et al., 2011a)."
"Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their
computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology
has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory
behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data
useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems
have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the
computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is
largely unrepresented.
  Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based
on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify
informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when
embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions
to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy
yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse
structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general
tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how
the proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of
behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how
it might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior."
"This paper derives an identity connecting the square loss of ridge regression
in on-line mode with the loss of the retrospectively best regressor. Some
corollaries about the properties of the cumulative loss of on-line ridge
regression are also obtained."
"Unsupervised aggregation of independently built univariate predictors is
explored as an alternative regularization approach for noisy, sparse datasets.
Bipartite ranking algorithm Smooth Rank implementing this approach is
introduced. The advantages of this algorithm are demonstrated on two types of
problems. First, Smooth Rank is applied to two-class problems from bio-medical
field, where ranking is often preferable to classification. In comparison
against SVMs with radial and linear kernels, Smooth Rank had the best
performance on 8 out of 12 benchmark benchmarks. The second area of application
is survival analysis, which is reduced here to bipartite ranking in a way which
allows one to use commonly accepted measures of methods performance. In
comparison of Smooth Rank with Cox PH regression and CoxPath methods, Smooth
Rank proved to be the best on 9 out of 10 benchmark datasets."
"We investigate a recently proposed family of positive-definite kernels that
mimic the computation in large neural networks. We examine the properties of
these kernels using tools from differential geometry; specifically, we analyze
the geometry of surfaces in Hilbert space that are induced by these kernels.
When this geometry is described by a Riemannian manifold, we derive results for
the metric, curvature, and volume element. Interestingly, though, we find that
the simplest kernel in this family does not admit such an interpretation. We
explore two variations of these kernels that mimic computation in neural
networks with different activation functions. We experiment with these new
kernels on several data sets and highlight their general trends in performance
for classification."
"We show how to incorporate information from labeled examples into nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for
dimensionality reduction. In addition to mapping the data into a space of lower
dimensionality, our approach aims to preserve the nonnegative components of the
data that are important for classification. We identify these components from
the support vectors of large-margin classifiers and derive iterative updates to
preserve them in a semi-supervised version of NMF. These updates have a simple
multiplicative form like their unsupervised counterparts; they are also
guaranteed at each iteration to decrease their loss function---a weighted sum
of I-divergences that captures the trade-off between unsupervised and
supervised learning. We evaluate these updates for dimensionality reduction
when they are used as a precursor to linear classification. In this role, we
find that they yield much better performance than their unsupervised
counterparts. We also find one unexpected benefit of the low dimensional
representations discovered by our approach: often they yield more accurate
classifiers than both ordinary and transductive SVMs trained in the original
input space."
"This paper provides a theoretical support for clustering aspect of the
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). By utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
optimality conditions, we show that NMF objective is equivalent to graph
clustering objective, so clustering aspect of the NMF has a solid
justification. Different from previous approaches which usually discard the
nonnegativity constraints, our approach guarantees the stationary point being
used in deriving the equivalence is located on the feasible region in the
nonnegative orthant. Additionally, since clustering capability of a matrix
decomposition technique can sometimes imply its latent semantic indexing (LSI)
aspect, we will also evaluate LSI aspect of the NMF by showing its capability
in solving the synonymy and polysemy problems in synthetic datasets. And more
extensive evaluation will be conducted by comparing LSI performances of the NMF
and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the standard LSI method, using some
standard datasets."
"The selection of the best classification algorithm for a given dataset is a
very widespread problem, occuring each time one has to choose a classifier to
solve a real-world problem. It is also a complex task with many important
methodological decisions to make. Among those, one of the most crucial is the
choice of an appropriate measure in order to properly assess the classification
performance and rank the algorithms. In this article, we focus on this specific
task. We present the most popular measures and compare their behavior through
discrimination plots. We then discuss their properties from a more theoretical
perspective. It turns out several of them are equivalent for classifiers
comparison purposes. Futhermore. they can also lead to interpretation problems.
Among the numerous measures proposed over the years, it appears that the
classical overall success rate and marginal rates are the more suitable for
classifier comparison task."
"We propose a new, nonparametric approach to estimating the value function in
reinforcement learning. This approach makes use of a recently developed
representation of conditional distributions as functions in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space. Such representations bypass the need for estimating
transition probabilities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be
defined. Our approach avoids the need to approximate intractable integrals
since expectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has
linear complexity in the sample size. Thus, we can efficiently perform value
function estimation in a wide variety of settings, including finite state
spaces, continuous states spaces, and partially observable tasks where only
sensor measurements are available. A second advantage of the approach is that
we learn the conditional distribution representation from a training sample,
and do not require an exhaustive exploration of the state space. We prove
convergence of our approach either to the optimal policy, or to the closest
projection of the optimal policy in our model class, under reasonable
assumptions. In experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on
a learning task in a continuous state space (the under-actuated pendulum), and
on a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed. We
compare with least-squares policy iteration where a Gaussian process is used
for value function estimation. Our algorithm achieves better performance in
both tasks."
"Selecting the best classifier among the available ones is a difficult task,
especially when only instances of one class exist. In this work we examine the
notion of combining one-class classifiers as an alternative for selecting the
best classifier. In particular, we propose two new one-class classification
performance measures to weigh classifiers and show that a simple ensemble that
implements these measures can outperform the most popular one-class ensembles.
Furthermore, we propose a new one-class ensemble scheme, TUPSO, which uses
meta-learning to combine one-class classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate the
superiority of TUPSO over all other tested ensembles and show that the TUPSO
performance is statistically indistinguishable from that of the hypothetical
best classifier."
"We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature
detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face
detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered
locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast
normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion
connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from
the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous
SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to
what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal
that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as
containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector
is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane
rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level
concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned
features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8% accuracy in recognizing 20,000
object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative improvement over the
previous state-of-the-art."
"Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning
manifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some
successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to
noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which
we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a
different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning
problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold
algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each
view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way
that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear}
dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for
two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance
operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold
problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can
aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data."
"Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) has focused on problems involving
many states and few actions, such as simple grid worlds. Most real world
problems, however, are of the opposite type, Involving Few relevant states and
many actions. For example, to return home from a conference, humans identify
only few subgoal states such as lobby, taxi, airport etc. Each valid behavior
connecting two such states can be viewed as an action, and there are trillions
of them. Assuming the subgoal identification problem is already solved, the
quality of any RL method---in real-world settings---depends less on how well it
scales with the number of states than on how well it scales with the number of
actions. This is where our new method T-Learning excels, by evaluating the
relatively few possible transits from one state to another in a
policy-independent way, rather than a huge number of state-action pairs, or
states in traditional policy-dependent ways. Illustrative experiments
demonstrate that performance improvements of T-Learning over Q-learning can be
arbitrarily large."
"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model
for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and
touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and
computational biology. This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP)
based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. TMBP toolbox is implemented by
MEX C++/Matlab/Octave for either Windows 7 or Linux. Compared with existing
topic modeling packages, the novelty of this toolbox lies in the BP algorithms
for learning LDA-based topic models. The current version includes BP algorithms
for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), author-topic models (ATM), relational
topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing project
and more BP-based algorithms for various topic models will be added in the near
future. Interested users may also extend BP algorithms for learning more
complicated topic models. The source codes are freely available under the GNU

"Leveraging the power of increasing amounts of data to analyze customer base
for attracting and retaining the most valuable customers is a major problem
facing companies in this information age. Data mining technologies extract
hidden information and knowledge from large data stored in databases or data
warehouses, thereby supporting the corporate decision making process. CRM uses
data mining (one of the elements of CRM) techniques to interact with customers.
This study investigates the use of a technique, semi-supervised learning, for
the management and analysis of customer-related data warehouse and information.
The idea of semi-supervised learning is to learn not only from the labeled
training data, but to exploit also the structural information in additionally
available unlabeled data. The proposed semi-supervised method is a model by
means of a feed-forward neural network trained by a back propagation algorithm
(multi-layer perceptron) in order to predict the category of an unknown
customer (potential customers). In addition, this technique can be used with
Rapid Miner tools for both labeled and unlabeled data."
"Diabetes is a major health problem in both developing and developed countries
and its incidence is rising dramatically. In this study, we investigate a novel
automatic approach to diagnose Diabetes disease based on Feature Weighted
Support Vector Machines (FW-SVMs) and Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS). The
proposed model consists of three stages: Firstly, PCA is applied to select an
optimal subset of features out of set of all the features. Secondly, Mutual
Information is employed to construct the FWSVM by weighting different features
based on their degree of importance. Finally, since parameter selection plays a
vital role in classification accuracy of SVMs, MCS is applied to select the
best parameter values. The proposed MI-MCS-FWSVM method obtains 93.58% accuracy
on UCI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms the previous methods by not only giving more accurate results but
also significantly speeding up the classification procedure."
"We present a novel approach to learn a kernel-based regression function. It
is based on the useof conical combinations of data-based parameterized kernels
and on a new stochastic convex optimization procedure of which we establish
convergence guarantees. The overall learning procedure has the nice properties
that a) the learned conical combination is automatically designed to perform
the regression task at hand and b) the updates implicated by the optimization
procedure are quite inexpensive. In order to shed light on the appositeness of
our learning strategy, we present empirical results from experiments conducted
on various benchmark datasets."
"Teaching is one of the most important factors affecting any education system.
Many research efforts have been conducted to facilitate the presentation modes
used by instructors in classrooms as well as provide means for students to
review lectures through web browsers. Other studies have been made to provide
acoustical design recommendations for classrooms like room size and
reverberation times. However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way
to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not
thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that
extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses
machine learning techniques to evaluate the acoustical quality of any learning
environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the
quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective
ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to
perform them continuously. We believe our system enables education systems to
continuously review and improve their teaching strategies and acoustical
quality of classrooms."
"We study the non-smooth optimization problems in machine learning, where both
the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth functions. Previous
studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss
function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for
non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family
of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is
bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization
problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox
method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of $O(1/T)$
{assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved}, significantly
faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed
method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in
machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods."
"In the current competitive world, industrial companies seek to manufacture
products of higher quality which can be achieved by increasing reliability,
maintainability and thus the availability of products. On the other hand,
improvement in products lifecycle is necessary for achieving high reliability.
Typically, maintenance activities are aimed to reduce failures of industrial
machinery and minimize the consequences of such failures. So the industrial
companies try to improve their efficiency by using different fault detection
techniques. One strategy is to process and analyze previous generated data to
predict future failures. The purpose of this paper is to detect wasted parts
using different data mining algorithms and compare the accuracy of these
algorithms. A combination of thermal and physical characteristics has been used
and the algorithms were implemented on Ahanpishegan's current data to estimate
the availability of its produced parts.

"Clustering is considered a non-supervised learning setting, in which the goal
is to partition a collection of data points into disjoint clusters. Often a
bound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner.
Many versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and
$k$-median.
  An underlying problem with the unsupervised nature of clustering it that of
determining a similarity function. One approach for alleviating this difficulty
is known as clustering with side information, alternatively, semi-supervised
clustering. Here, the practitioner incorporates side information in the form of
""must be clustered"" or ""must be separated"" labels for data point pairs. Each
such piece of information comes at a ""query cost"" (often involving human
response solicitation). The collection of labels is then incorporated in the
usual clustering algorithm as either strict or as soft constraints, possibly
adding a pairwise constraint penalty function to the chosen clustering
objective.
  Our work is mostly related to clustering with side information. We ask how to
choose the pairs of data points. Our analysis gives rise to a method provably
better than simply choosing them uniformly at random. Roughly speaking, we show
that the distribution must be biased so as more weight is placed on pairs
incident to elements in smaller clusters in some optimal solution. Of course we
do not know the optimal solution, hence we don't know the bias. Using the
recently introduced method of $\eps$-smooth relative regret approximations of
Ailon, Begleiter and Ezra, we can show an iterative process that improves both
the clustering and the bias in tandem. The process provably converges to the
optimal solution faster (in terms of query cost) than an algorithm selecting
pairs uniformly."
"In this paper, we study the application of GIST SVM in disease prediction
(detection of cancer). Pattern classification problems can be effectively
solved by Support vector machines. Here we propose a classifier which can
differentiate patients having benign and malignant cancer cells. To improve the
accuracy of classification, we propose to determine the optimal size of the
training set and perform feature selection. To find the optimal size of the
training set, different sizes of training sets are experimented and the one
with highest classification rate is selected. The optimal features are selected
through their F-Scores."
"This work explores the effects of relevant and irrelevant boolean variables
on the accuracy of classifiers. The analysis uses the assumption that the
variables are conditionally independent given the class, and focuses on a
natural family of learning algorithms for such sources when the relevant
variables have a small advantage over random guessing. The main result is that
algorithms relying predominately on irrelevant variables have error
probabilities that quickly go to 0 in situations where algorithms that limit
the use of irrelevant variables have errors bounded below by a positive
constant. We also show that accurate learning is possible even when there are
so few examples that one cannot determine with high confidence whether or not
any individual variable is relevant."
"Now-a-days the amount of data stored in educational database increasing
rapidly. These databases contain hidden information for improvement of
students' performance. Educational data mining is used to study the data
available in the educational field and bring out the hidden knowledge from it.
Classification methods like decision trees, Bayesian network etc can be applied
on the educational data for predicting the student's performance in
examination. This prediction will help to identify the weak students and help
them to score better marks. The C4.5, ID3 and CART decision tree algorithms are
applied on engineering student's data to predict their performance in the final
exam. The outcome of the decision tree predicted the number of students who are
likely to pass, fail or promoted to next year. The results provide steps to
improve the performance of the students who were predicted to fail or promoted.
After the declaration of the results in the final examination the marks
obtained by the students are fed into the system and the results were analyzed
for the next session. The comparative analysis of the results states that the
prediction has helped the weaker students to improve and brought out betterment
in the result."
"We investigate adaptive mixture methods that linearly combine outputs of $m$
constituent filters running in parallel to model a desired signal. We use
""Bregman divergences"" and obtain certain multiplicative updates to train the
linear combination weights under an affine constraint or without any
constraints. We use unnormalized relative entropy and relative entropy to
define two different Bregman divergences that produce an unnormalized
exponentiated gradient update and a normalized exponentiated gradient update on
the mixture weights, respectively. We then carry out the mean and the
mean-square transient analysis of these adaptive algorithms when they are used
to combine outputs of $m$ constituent filters. We illustrate the accuracy of
our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of these updates for sparse
mixture systems."
"The past century was era of linear systems. Either systems (especially
industrial ones) were simple (quasi)linear or linear approximations were
accurate enough. In addition, just at the ending decades of the century
profusion of computing devices were available, before then due to lack of
computational resources it was not easy to evaluate available nonlinear system
studies. At the moment both these two conditions changed, systems are highly
complex and also pervasive amount of computation strength is cheap and easy to
achieve. For recent era, a new branch of supervised learning well known as
surrogate modeling (meta-modeling, surface modeling) has been devised which
aimed at answering new needs of modeling realm. This short literature survey is
on to introduce surrogate modeling to whom is familiar with the concepts of
supervised learning. Necessity, challenges and visions of the topic are
considered."
"Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is an approach to average over alternative
models; yet, it usually gets excessively concentrated around the single most
probable model, therefore achieving only sub-optimal classification
performance. The compression-based approach (Boulle, 2007) overcomes this
problem, averaging over the different models by applying a logarithmic
smoothing over the models' posterior probabilities. This approach has shown
excellent performances when applied to ensembles of naive Bayes classifiers.
AODE is another ensemble of models with high performance (Webb, 2005), based on
a collection of non-naive classifiers (called SPODE) whose probabilistic
predictions are aggregated by simple arithmetic mean. Aggregating the SPODEs
via BMA rather than by arithmetic mean deteriorates the performance; instead,
we aggregate the SPODEs via the compression coefficients and we show that the
resulting classifier obtains a slight but consistent improvement over AODE.
However, an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models is the
arbitrariness in the choice of the prior over the models. We address this
problem by the paradigm of credal classification, namely by substituting the
unique prior with a set of priors. Credal classifier automatically recognize
the prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class
varies, when different priors are considered; in these cases, credal
classifiers remain reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single
class. We thus develop the credal version of both the BMA-based and the
compression-based ensemble of SPODEs, substituting the single prior over the
models by a set of priors. Experiments show that both credal classifiers
provide higher classification reliability than their determinate counterparts;
moreover the compression-based credal classifier compares favorably to previous
credal classifiers."
"We present a novel approach for training kernel Support Vector Machines,
establish learning runtime guarantees for our method that are better then those
of any other known kernelized SVM optimization approach, and show that our
method works well in practice compared to existing alternatives."
"Probabilistic generative modeling of data distributions can potentially
exploit hidden information which is useful for discriminative classification.
This observation has motivated the development of approaches that couple
generative and discriminative models for classification. In this paper, we
propose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in an
unified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive the
model-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAP
classifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linear
stochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive the
explicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised and
semi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterative
procedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and the
update rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior is
always feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicit
form of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generative
models and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. The
derived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupled
models as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent. Our experiments
show that the coupling between data modeling generative model and the
discriminative classifier via a stochastic feature mapping in this framework
leads to a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance."
"Nowadays, supervised learning is commonly used in many domains. Indeed, many
works propose to learn new knowledge from examples that translate the expected
behaviour of the considered system. A key issue of supervised learning concerns
the description language used to represent the examples. In this paper, we
propose a method to evaluate the feature set used to describe them. Our method
is based on the computation of the consistency of the example base. We carried
out a case study in the domain of geomatic in order to evaluate the sets of
measures used to characterise geographic objects. The case study shows that our
method allows to give relevant evaluations of measure sets."
"Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to help
classify new, ""target"" data since similar instances in the target set are more
likely to share the same class label. Such models can also help detect possible
differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in
applications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning
settings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes as
input class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previously
encountered ""source"" data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster
ensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a
consensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range of
loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of
Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled
and scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposed
framework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by popular
transductive learning techniques or by naively applying classifiers learnt on
the original task to the target data."
"Numerous data mining techniques have been developed to extract information
and identify patterns and predict trends from large data sets. In this study,
two classification techniques, the J48 implementation of the C4.5 algorithm and
a Naive Bayes classifier are applied to predict lung cancer survivability from
an extensive data set with fifteen years of patient records. The purpose of the
project is to verify the predictive effectiveness of the two techniques on
real, historical data. Besides the performance outcome that renders J48
marginally better than the Naive Bayes technique, there is a detailed
description of the data and the required pre-processing activities. The
performance results confirm expectations while some of the issues that appeared
during experimentation, underscore the value of having domain-specific
understanding to leverage any domain-specific characteristics inherent in the
data."
"The CSA-ES is an Evolution Strategy with Cumulative Step size Adaptation,
where the step size is adapted measuring the length of a so-called cumulative
path. The cumulative path is a combination of the previous steps realized by
the algorithm, where the importance of each step decreases with time. This
article studies the CSA-ES on composites of strictly increasing with affine
linear functions through the investigation of its underlying Markov chains.
Rigorous results on the change and the variation of the step size are derived
with and without cumulation. The step-size diverges geometrically fast in most
cases. Furthermore, the influence of the cumulation parameter is studied."
"This paper presents a novel communication-efficient parallel belief
propagation (CE-PBP) algorithm for training latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
Based on the synchronous belief propagation (BP) algorithm, we first develop a
parallel belief propagation (PBP) algorithm on the parallel architecture.
Because the extensive communication delay often causes a low efficiency of
parallel topic modeling, we further use Zipf's law to reduce the total
communication cost in PBP. Extensive experiments on different data sets
demonstrate that CE-PBP achieves a higher topic modeling accuracy and reduces
more than 80% communication cost than the state-of-the-art parallel Gibbs
sampling (PGS) algorithm."
"We consider a multi-armed bandit setting that is inspired by real-world
applications in e-commerce. In our setting, there are a few types of users,
each with a specific response to the different arms. When a user enters the
system, his type is unknown to the decision maker. The decision maker can
either treat each user separately ignoring the previously observed users, or
can attempt to take advantage of knowing that only few types exist and cluster
the users according to their response to the arms. We devise algorithms that
combine the usual exploration-exploitation tradeoff with clustering of users
and demonstrate the value of clustering. In the process of developing
algorithms for the clustered setting, we propose and analyze simple algorithms
for the setup where a decision maker knows that a user belongs to one of few
types, but does not know which one."
"In this paper, we propose a new Soft Confidence-Weighted (SCW) online
learning scheme, which enables the conventional confidence-weighted learning
method to handle non-separable cases. Unlike the previous confidence-weighted
learning algorithms, the proposed soft confidence-weighted learning method
enjoys all the four salient properties: (i) large margin training, (ii)
confidence weighting, (iii) capability to handle non-separable data, and (iv)
adaptive margin. Our experimental results show that the proposed SCW algorithms
significantly outperform the original CW algorithm. When comparing with a
variety of state-of-the-art algorithms (including AROW, NAROW and NHERD), we
found that SCW generally achieves better or at least comparable predictive
accuracy, but enjoys significant advantage of computational efficiency (i.e.,
smaller number of updates and lower time cost)."
"Low-rank matrix decomposition has gained great popularity recently in scaling
up kernel methods to large amounts of data. However, some limitations could
prevent them from working effectively in certain domains. For example, many
existing approaches are intrinsically unsupervised, which does not incorporate
side information (e.g., class labels) to produce task specific decompositions;
also, they typically work ""transductively"", i.e., the factorization does not
generalize to new samples, so the complete factorization needs to be recomputed
when new samples become available. To solve these problems, in this paper we
propose an""inductive""-flavored method for low-rank kernel decomposition with
priors. We achieve this by generalizing the Nystr\""om method in a novel way. On
the one hand, our approach employs a highly flexible, nonparametric structure
that allows us to generalize the low-rank factors to arbitrarily new samples;
on the other hand, it has linear time and space complexities, which can be
orders of magnitudes faster than existing approaches and renders great
efficiency in learning a low-rank kernel decomposition. Empirical results
demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method."
"There has been a recent focus in reinforcement learning on addressing
continuous state and action problems by optimizing parameterized policies. PI2
is a recent example of this approach. It combines a derivation from first
principles of stochastic optimal control with tools from statistical estimation
theory. In this paper, we consider PI2 as a member of the wider family of
methods which share the concept of probability-weighted averaging to
iteratively update parameters to optimize a cost function. We compare PI2 to
other members of the same family - Cross-Entropy Methods and CMAES - at the
conceptual level and in terms of performance. The comparison suggests the
derivation of a novel algorithm which we call PI2-CMA for ""Path Integral Policy
Improvement with Covariance Matrix Adaptation"". PI2-CMA's main advantage is
that it determines the magnitude of the exploration noise automatically."
"F-measures are popular performance metrics, particularly for tasks with
imbalanced data sets. Algorithms for learning to maximize F-measures follow two
approaches: the empirical utility maximization (EUM) approach learns a
classifier having optimal performance on training data, while the
decision-theoretic approach learns a probabilistic model and then predicts
labels with maximum expected F-measure. In this paper, we investigate the
theoretical justifications and connections for these two approaches, and we
study the conditions under which one approach is preferable to the other using
synthetic and real datasets. Given accurate models, our results suggest that
the two approaches are asymptotically equivalent given large training and test
sets. Nevertheless, empirically, the EUM approach appears to be more robust
against model misspecification, and given a good model, the decision-theoretic
approach appears to be better for handling rare classes and a common domain
adaptation scenario."
"We study the problem of multiple kernel learning from noisy labels. This is
in contrast to most of the previous studies on multiple kernel learning that
mainly focus on developing efficient algorithms and assume perfectly labeled
training examples. Directly applying the existing multiple kernel learning
algorithms to noisily labeled examples often leads to suboptimal performance
due to the incorrect class assignments. We address this challenge by casting
multiple kernel learning from noisy labels into a stochastic programming
problem, and presenting a minimax formulation. We develop an efficient
algorithm for solving the related convex-concave optimization problem with a
fast convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ where $T$ is the number of iterations.
Empirical studies on UCI data sets verify both the effectiveness of the
proposed framework and the efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm."
"Structured prediction is the cornerstone of several machine learning
applications. Unfortunately, in structured prediction settings with expressive
inter-variable interactions, exact inference-based learning algorithms, e.g.
Structural SVM, are often intractable. We present a new way, Decomposed
Learning (DecL), which performs efficient learning by restricting the inference
step to a limited part of the structured spaces. We provide characterizations
based on the structure, target parameters, and gold labels, under which DecL is
equivalent to exact learning. We then show that in real world settings, where
our theoretical assumptions may not completely hold, DecL-based algorithms are
significantly more efficient and as accurate as exact learning."
"Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning
manifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some
successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to
noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which
we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a
different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning
problems together, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a
non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in
the other, reducing bias. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold
problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in
Hilbert space, and discuss when two-manifold problems are useful. Finally, we
demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear
dynamical system from limited data."
"We propose a new, nonparametric approach to learning and representing
transition dynamics in Markov decision processes (MDPs), which can be combined
easily with dynamic programming methods for policy optimisation and value
estimation. This approach makes use of a recently developed representation of
conditional distributions as \emph{embeddings} in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). Such representations bypass the need for estimating transition
probabilities or densities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be
defined. This avoids the need to calculate intractable integrals, since
expectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has
linear complexity in the number of points used to represent the embedding. We
provide guarantees for the proposed applications in MDPs: in the context of a
value iteration algorithm, we prove convergence to either the optimal policy,
or to the closest projection of the optimal policy in our model class (an
RKHS), under reasonable assumptions. In experiments, we investigate a learning
task in a typical classical control setting (the under-actuated pendulum), and
on a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed. For
policy optimisation we compare with least-squares policy iteration where a
Gaussian process is used for value function estimation. For value estimation we
also compare to the NPDP method. Our approach achieves better performance in
all experiments."
"We propose a new learning method for heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA),
in which the data from the source domain and the target domain are represented
by heterogeneous features with different dimensions. Using two different
projection matrices, we first transform the data from two domains into a common
subspace in order to measure the similarity between the data from two domains.
We then propose two new feature mapping functions to augment the transformed
data with their original features and zeros. The existing learning methods
(e.g., SVM and SVR) can be readily incorporated with our newly proposed
augmented feature representations to effectively utilize the data from both
domains for HDA. Using the hinge loss function in SVM as an example, we
introduce the detailed objective function in our method called Heterogeneous
Feature Augmentation (HFA) for a linear case and also describe its
kernelization in order to efficiently cope with the data with very high
dimensions. Moreover, we also develop an alternating optimization algorithm to
effectively solve the nontrivial optimization problem in our HFA method.
Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that
HFA outperforms the existing HDA methods."
"Stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAs) have been successfully used to learn
new representations for domain adaptation. Recently, they have attained record
accuracy on standard benchmark tasks of sentiment analysis across different
text domains. SDAs learn robust data representations by reconstruction,
recovering original features from data that are artificially corrupted with
noise. In this paper, we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two
crucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to
high-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs, our approach of mSDA
marginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or
other optimization algorithms to learn parameters ? in fact, they are computed
in closed-form. Consequently, mSDA, which can be implemented in only 20 lines
of MATLAB^{TM}, significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude.
Furthermore, the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the
traditional SDAs, attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks."
"We consider a dynamic pricing problem under unknown demand models. In this
problem a seller offers prices to a stream of customers and observes either
success or failure in each sale attempt. The underlying demand model is unknown
to the seller and can take one of N possible forms. In this paper, we show that
this problem can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit with dependent arms. We
propose a dynamic pricing policy based on the likelihood ratio test. We show
that the proposed policy achieves complete learning, i.e., it offers a bounded
regret where regret is defined as the revenue loss with respect to the case
with a known demand model. This is in sharp contrast with the logarithmic
growing regret in multi-armed bandit with independent arms."
"Learning algorithms related to artificial neural networks and in particular
for Deep Learning may seem to involve many bells and whistles, called
hyper-parameters. This chapter is meant as a practical guide with
recommendations for some of the most commonly used hyper-parameters, in
particular in the context of learning algorithms based on back-propagated
gradient and gradient-based optimization. It also discusses how to deal with
the fact that more interesting results can be obtained when allowing one to
adjust many hyper-parameters. Overall, it describes elements of the practice
used to successfully and efficiently train and debug large-scale and often deep
multi-layer neural networks. It closes with open questions about the training
difficulties observed with deeper architectures."
"The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data
representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different
representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory
factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be
used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be
used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful
representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews
recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning,
covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning,
and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the
appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing
representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between
representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning."
"In this paper we consider the problem of collectively classifying entities
where relational information is available across the entities. In practice
inaccurate class distribution for each entity is often available from another
(external) classifier. For example this distribution could come from a
classifier built using content features or a simple dictionary. Given the
relational and inaccurate external classifier information, we consider two
graph based settings in which the problem of collective classification can be
solved. In the first setting the class distribution is used to fix labels to a
subset of nodes and the labels for the remaining nodes are obtained like in a
transductive setting. In the other setting the class distributions of all nodes
are used to define the fitting function part of a graph regularized objective
function. We define a generalized objective function that handles both the
settings. Methods like harmonic Gaussian field and local-global consistency
(LGC) reported in the literature can be seen as special cases. We extend the
LGC and weighted vote relational neighbor classification (WvRN) methods to
support usage of external classifier information. We also propose an efficient
least squares regularization (LSR) based method and relate it to information
regularization methods. All the methods are evaluated on several benchmark and
real world datasets. Considering together speed, robustness and accuracy,
experimental results indicate that the LSR and WvRN-extension methods perform
better than other methods."
"Metric learning methods have been shown to perform well on different learning
tasks. Many of them rely on target neighborhood relationships that are computed
in the original feature space and remain fixed throughout learning. As a
result, the learned metric reflects the original neighborhood relations. We
propose a novel formulation of the metric learning problem in which, in
addition to the metric, the target neighborhood relations are also learned in a
two-step iterative approach. The new formulation can be seen as a
generalization of many existing metric learning methods. The formulation
includes a target neighbor assignment rule that assigns different numbers of
neighbors to instances according to their quality; `high quality' instances get
more neighbors. We experiment with two of its instantiations that correspond to
the metric learning algorithms LMNN and MCML and compare it to other metric
learning methods on a number of datasets. The experimental results show
state-of-the-art performance and provide evidence that learning the
neighborhood relations does improve predictive performance."
"This paper focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) with limited prior
knowledge. In the domain of swarm robotics for instance, the expert can hardly
design a reward function or demonstrate the target behavior, forbidding the use
of both standard RL and inverse reinforcement learning. Although with a limited
expertise, the human expert is still often able to emit preferences and rank
the agent demonstrations. Earlier work has presented an iterative
preference-based RL framework: expert preferences are exploited to learn an
approximate policy return, thus enabling the agent to achieve direct policy
search. Iteratively, the agent selects a new candidate policy and demonstrates
it; the expert ranks the new demonstration comparatively to the previous best
one; the expert's ranking feedback enables the agent to refine the approximate
policy return, and the process is iterated. In this paper, preference-based
reinforcement learning is combined with active ranking in order to decrease the
number of ranking queries to the expert needed to yield a satisfactory policy.
Experiments on the mountain car and the cancer treatment testbeds witness that
a couple of dozen rankings enable to learn a competent policy."
"The real challenge in pattern recognition task and machine learning process
is to train a discriminator using labeled data and use it to distinguish
between future data as accurate as possible. However, most of the problems in
the real world have numerous data, which labeling them is a cumbersome or even
an impossible matter. Semi-supervised learning is one approach to overcome
these types of problems. It uses only a small set of labeled with the company
of huge remain and unlabeled data to train the discriminator. In
semi-supervised learning, it is very essential that which data is labeled and
depend on position of data it effectiveness changes. In this paper, we proposed
an evolutionary approach called Artificial Immune System (AIS) to determine
which data is better to be labeled to get the high quality data. The
experimental results represent the effectiveness of this algorithm in finding
these data points."
"It is often the case that, within an online recommender system, multiple
users share a common account. Can such shared accounts be identified solely on
the basis of the user- provided ratings? Once a shared account is identified,
can the different users sharing it be identified as well? Whenever such user
identification is feasible, it opens the way to possible improvements in
personalized recommendations, but also raises privacy concerns. We develop a
model for composite accounts based on unions of linear subspaces, and use
subspace clustering for carrying out the identification task. We show that a
significant fraction of such accounts is identifiable in a reliable manner, and
illustrate potential uses for personalized recommendation."
"In this paper, we attempts to learn a single metric across two heterogeneous
domains where source domain is fully labeled and has many samples while target
domain has only a few labeled samples but abundant unlabeled samples. To the
best of our knowledge, this task is seldom touched. The proposed learning model
has a simple underlying motivation: all the samples in both the source and the
target domains are mapped into a common space, where both their priors
P(sample)s and their posteriors P(label|sample)s are forced to be respectively
aligned as much as possible. We show that the two mappings, from both the
source domain and the target domain to the common space, can be reparameterized
into a single positive semi-definite(PSD) matrix. Then we develop an efficient
Bregman Projection algorithm to optimize the PDS matrix over which a LogDet
function is used to regularize. Furthermore, we also show that this model can
be easily kernelized and verify its effectiveness in crosslanguage retrieval
task and cross-domain object recognition task."
"Schapire's margin theory provides a theoretical explanation to the success of
boosting-type methods and manifests that a good margin distribution (MD) of
training samples is essential for generalization. However the statement that a
MD is good is vague, consequently, many recently developed algorithms try to
generate a MD in their goodness senses for boosting generalization. Unlike
their indirect control over MD, in this paper, we propose an alternative
boosting algorithm termed Margin distribution Controlled Boosting (MCBoost)
which directly controls the MD by introducing and optimizing a key adjustable
margin parameter. MCBoost's optimization implementation adopts the column
generation technique to ensure fast convergence and small number of weak
classifiers involved in the final MCBooster. We empirically demonstrate: 1)
AdaBoost is actually also a MD controlled algorithm and its iteration number
acts as a parameter controlling the distribution and 2) the generalization
performance of MCBoost evaluated on UCI benchmark datasets is validated better
than those of AdaBoost, L2Boost, LPBoost, AdaBoost-CG and MDBoost."
"We present new algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL, or inverse
optimal control) in convex optimization settings. We argue that finite-space
IRL can be posed as a convex quadratic program under a Bayesian inference
framework with the objective of maximum a posterior estimation. To deal with
problems in large or even infinite state space, we propose a Gaussian process
model and use preference graphs to represent observations of decision
trajectories. Our method is distinguished from other approaches to IRL in that
it makes no assumptions about the form of the reward function and yet it
retains the promise of computationally manageable implementations for potential
real-world applications. In comparison with an establish algorithm on
small-scale numerical problems, our method demonstrated better accuracy in
apprenticeship learning and a more robust dependence on the number of
observations."
"We study pool-based active learning of half-spaces. We revisit the aggressive
approach for active learning in the realizable case, and show that it can be
made efficient and practical, while also having theoretical guarantees under
reasonable assumptions. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally,
that it can be preferable to mellow approaches. Our efficient aggressive active
learner of half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the
pool is separable with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the
realizable setting, we show that a simple heuristic allows using the same
algorithm successfully for pools with low error as well. We further compare the
aggressive approach to the mellow approach, and prove that there are cases in
which the aggressive approach results in significantly better label complexity
compared to the mellow approach. We demonstrate experimentally that substantial
improvements in label complexity can be achieved using the aggressive approach,
for both realizable and low-error settings."
"Many different machine learning algorithms exist; taking into account each
algorithm's hyperparameters, there is a staggeringly large number of possible
alternatives overall. We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a
learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work
that addresses these issues in isolation. We show that this problem can be
addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in
Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature
selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all
classification approaches implemented in WEKA, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10
meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each
classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup
09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification
performance often much better than using standard selection/hyperparameter
optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to
more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter
settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved
performance."
"Scientists study trajectory data to understand trends in movement patterns,
such as human mobility for traffic analysis and urban planning. There is a
pressing need for scalable and efficient techniques for analyzing this data and
discovering the underlying patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel
technique which we call vector-field $k$-means.
  The central idea of our approach is to use vector fields to induce a
similarity notion between trajectories. Other clustering algorithms seek a
representative trajectory that best describes each cluster, much like $k$-means
identifies a representative ""center"" for each cluster. Vector-field $k$-means,
on the other hand, recognizes that in all but the simplest examples, no single
trajectory adequately describes a cluster. Our approach is based on the premise
that movement trends in trajectory data can be modeled as flows within multiple
vector fields, and the vector field itself is what defines each of the
clusters. We also show how vector-field $k$-means connects techniques for
scalar field design on meshes and $k$-means clustering.
  We present an algorithm that finds a locally optimal clustering of
trajectories into vector fields, and demonstrate how vector-field $k$-means can
be used to mine patterns from trajectory data. We present experimental evidence
of its effectiveness and efficiency using several datasets, including
historical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and anonymous
call records from a large phone company. We compare our results to previous
trajectory clustering techniques, and find that our algorithm performs faster
in practice than the current state-of-the-art in trajectory clustering, in some
examples by a large margin."
"This study deals with the missing link prediction problem: the problem of
predicting the existence of missing connections between entities of interest.
We address link prediction using coupled analysis of relational datasets
represented as heterogeneous data, i.e., datasets in the form of matrices and
higher-order tensors. We propose to use an approach based on probabilistic
interpretation of tensor factorisation models, i.e., Generalised Coupled Tensor
Factorisation, which can simultaneously fit a large class of tensor models to
higher-order tensors/matrices with com- mon latent factors using different loss
functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that joint analysis of data from
multiple sources via coupled factorisation improves the link prediction
performance and the selection of right loss function and tensor model is
crucial for accurately predicting missing links."
"Transductive SVM (TSVM) is a well known semi-supervised large margin learning
method for binary text classification. In this paper we extend this method to
multi-class and hierarchical classification problems. We point out that the
determination of labels of unlabeled examples with fixed classifier weights is
a linear programming problem. We devise an efficient technique for solving it.
The method is applicable to general loss functions. We demonstrate the value of
the new method using large margin loss on a number of multi-class and
hierarchical classification datasets. For maxent loss we show empirically that
our method is better than expectation regularization/constraint and posterior
regularization methods, and competitive with the version of entropy
regularization method which uses label constraints."
"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for piecewise linear regression
which can learn continuous as well as discontinuous piecewise linear functions.
The main idea is to repeatedly partition the data and learn a liner model in in
each partition. While a simple algorithm incorporating this idea does not work
well, an interesting modification results in a good algorithm. The proposed
algorithm is similar in spirit to $k$-means clustering algorithm. We show that
our algorithm can also be viewed as an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood
estimation of parameters under a reasonable probability model. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with
the state of art regression learning algorithms on some real world datasets."
"This paper presents algorithm for missing values imputation in categorical
data. The algorithm is based on using association rules and is presented in
three variants. Experimental shows better accuracy of missing values imputation
using the algorithm then using most common attribute value."
"Some of the most compelling applications of online convex optimization,
including online prediction and classification, are unconstrained: the natural
feasible set is R^n. Existing algorithms fail to achieve sub-linear regret in
this setting unless constraints on the comparator point x^* are known in
advance. We present algorithms that, without such prior knowledge, offer
near-optimal regret bounds with respect to any choice of x^*. In particular,
regret with respect to x^* = 0 is constant. We then prove lower bounds showing
that our guarantees are near-optimal in this setting."
"Random projection has been widely used in data classification. It maps
high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional subspace in order to reduce the
computational cost in solving the related optimization problem. While previous
studies are focused on analyzing the classification performance of using random
projection, in this work, we consider the recovery problem, i.e., how to
accurately recover the optimal solution to the original optimization problem in
the high-dimensional space based on the solution learned from the subspace
spanned by random projections. We present a simple algorithm, termed Dual
Random Projection, that uses the dual solution of the low-dimensional
optimization problem to recover the optimal solution to the original problem.
Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, the proposed
algorithm is able to accurately recover the optimal solution to the original
problem, provided that the data matrix is of low rank or can be well
approximated by a low rank matrix."
"There are two widely known issues with properly training Recurrent Neural
Networks, the vanishing and the exploding gradient problems detailed in Bengio
et al. (1994). In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the
underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric
and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple
yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal
with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients
problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the
experimental section."
"Improving students academic performance is not an easy task for the academic
community of higher learning. The academic performance of engineering and
science students during their first year at university is a turning point in
their educational path and usually encroaches on their General Point
Average,GPA in a decisive manner. The students evaluation factors like class
quizzes mid and final exam assignment lab work are studied. It is recommended
that all these correlated information should be conveyed to the class teacher
before the conduction of final exam. This study will help the teachers to
reduce the drop out ratio to a significant level and improve the performance of
students. In this paper, we present a hybrid procedure based on Decision Tree
of Data mining method and Data Clustering that enables academicians to predict
students GPA and based on that instructor can take necessary step to improve
student academic performance."
"In many practical applications of supervised learning the task involves the
prediction of multiple target variables from a common set of input variables.
When the prediction targets are binary the task is called multi-label
classification, while when the targets are continuous the task is called
multi-target regression. In both tasks, target variables often exhibit
statistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive
accuracy is a core challenge. A family of multi-label classification methods
address this challenge by building a separate model for each target on an
expanded input space where other targets are treated as additional input
variables. Despite the success of these methods in the multi-label
classification domain, their applicability and effectiveness in multi-target
regression has not been studied until now. In this paper, we introduce two new
methods for multi-target regression, called Stacked Single-Target and Ensemble
of Regressor Chains, by adapting two popular multi-label classification methods
of this family. Furthermore, we highlight an inherent problem of these methods
- a discrepancy of the values of the additional input variables between
training and prediction - and develop extensions that use out-of-sample
estimates of the target variables during training in order to tackle this
problem. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation carried out on a
large and diverse collection of datasets show that, when the discrepancy is
appropriately mitigated, the proposed methods attain consistent improvements
over the independent regressions baseline. Moreover, two versions of Ensemble
of Regression Chains perform significantly better than four state-of-the-art
methods including regularization-based multi-task learning methods and a
multi-objective random forest approach."
"In multiclass semi-supervised learning (SSL), it is sometimes the case that
the number of classes present in the data is not known, and hence no labeled
examples are provided for some classes. In this paper we present variants of
well-known semi-supervised multiclass learning methods that are robust when the
data contains an unknown number of classes. In particular, we present an
""exploratory"" extension of expectation-maximization (EM) that explores
different numbers of classes while learning. ""Exploratory"" SSL greatly improves
performance on three datasets in terms of F1 on the classes with seed examples
i.e., the classes which are expected to be in the data. Our Exploratory EM
algorithm also outperforms a SSL method based non-parametric Bayesian
clustering."
"This tutorial gives a concise overview of existing PAC-Bayesian theory
focusing on three generalization bounds. The first is an Occam bound which
handles rules with finite precision parameters and which states that
generalization loss is near training loss when the number of bits needed to
write the rule is small compared to the sample size. The second is a
PAC-Bayesian bound providing a generalization guarantee for posterior
distributions rather than for individual rules. The PAC-Bayesian bound
naturally handles infinite precision rule parameters, $L_2$ regularization,
{\em provides a bound for dropout training}, and defines a natural notion of a
single distinguished PAC-Bayesian posterior distribution. The third bound is a
training-variance bound --- a kind of bias-variance analysis but with bias
replaced by expected training loss. The training-variance bound dominates the
other bounds but is more difficult to interpret. It seems to suggest variance
reduction methods such as bagging and may ultimately provide a more meaningful
analysis of dropouts."
"We describe the line search used in the minimum error rate training algorithm
MERT as the ""inside score"" of a weighted proof forest under a semiring defined
in terms of well-understood operations from computational geometry. This
conception leads to a straightforward complexity analysis of the dynamic
programming MERT algorithms of Macherey et al. (2008) and Kumar et al. (2009)
and practical approaches to implementation."
"The multi-label classification problem has generated significant interest in
recent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key
challenges: (a) the ability to tackle problems with a large number (say
millions) of labels, and (b) the ability to handle data with missing labels. In
this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label
problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our
framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several
recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of
our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the
structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to
offer efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits
formal excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our risk
bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank
promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive)
Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results
on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform
significantly better than existing label compression based methods and can
scale up to very large datasets such as the Wikipedia dataset."
"In this paper we study a generalized version of classical multi-armed bandits
(MABs) problem by allowing for arbitrary constraints on constituent bandits at
each decision point. The motivation of this study comes from many situations
that involve repeatedly making choices subject to arbitrary constraints in an
uncertain environment: for instance, regularly deciding which advertisements to
display online in order to gain high click-through-rate without knowing user
preferences, or what route to drive home each day under uncertain weather and
traffic conditions. Assume that there are $K$ unknown random variables (RVs),
i.e., arms, each evolving as an \emph{i.i.d} stochastic process over time. At
each decision epoch, we select a strategy, i.e., a subset of RVs, subject to
arbitrary constraints on constituent RVs.
  We then gain a reward that is a linear combination of observations on
selected RVs.
  The performance of prior results for this problem heavily depends on the
distribution of strategies generated by corresponding learning policy. For
example, if the reward-difference between the best and second best strategy
approaches zero, prior result may lead to arbitrarily large regret.
  Meanwhile, when there are exponential number of possible strategies at each
decision point, naive extension of a prior distribution-free policy would cause
poor performance in terms of regret, computation and space complexity.
  To this end, we propose an efficient Distribution-Free Learning (DFL) policy
that achieves zero regret, regardless of the probability distribution of the
resultant strategies.
  Our learning policy has both $O(K)$ time complexity and $O(K)$ space
complexity. In successive generations, we show that even if finding the optimal
strategy at each decision point is NP-hard, our policy still allows for
approximated solutions while retaining near zero-regret."
"We present a scalable and effective classification model to train multi-class
boosting for multi-class classification problems. Shen and Hao introduced a
direct formulation of multi- class boosting in the sense that it directly
maximizes the multi- class margin [C. Shen and Z. Hao, ""A direct formulation
for totally-corrective multi- class boosting"", in Proc. IEEE Conf. Comp. Vis.
Patt. Recogn., 2011]. The major problem of their approach is its high
computational complexity for training, which hampers its application on
real-world problems. In this work, we propose a scalable and simple stage-wise
multi-class boosting method, which also directly maximizes the multi-class
margin. Our approach of- fers a few advantages: 1) it is simple and
computationally efficient to train. The approach can speed up the training time
by more than two orders of magnitude without sacrificing the classification
accuracy. 2) Like traditional AdaBoost, it is less sensitive to the choice of
parameters and empirically demonstrates excellent generalization performance.
Experimental results on challenging multi-class machine learning and vision
tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves the
convergence rate and accuracy of the final visual detector at no additional
computational cost compared to existing multi-class boosting."
"In this work, we define cost-free learning (CFL) formally in comparison with
cost-sensitive learning (CSL). The main difference between them is that a CFL
approach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost
information, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL
approaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some
criteria-based pproaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing
CFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications
properly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on
information theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized
mutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers.
Using the strategy, we can deal with binary/multi-class classifications
with/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new
strategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed
strategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and
automatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving
optimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the
""equivalent"" costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection
thresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on
several benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The
classification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in
machine learning."
"In this paper Knockout Refinement Algorithm (KRA) is proposed to refine
original clusters obtained by applying SOM and K-Means clustering algorithms.
KRA Algorithm is based on Contingency Table concepts. Metrics are computed for
the Original and Refined Clusters. Quality of Original and Refined Clusters are
compared in terms of metrics. The proposed algorithm (KRA) is tested in the
educational domain and results show that it generates better quality clusters
in terms of improved metric values."
"We consider online learning when the time horizon is unknown. We apply a
minimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to
two unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly
according to some known distribution, and the other which allows the adversary
full control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted
losses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial
horizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the
adversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known.
Based on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a
new adaptive algorithm which ""pretends"" that the horizon is drawn from a
distribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is
chosen, the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our
algorithm can be combined and applied in many ways, for instance, to online
convex optimization, follow the perturbed leader, exponential weights algorithm
and first order bounds. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms many
other existing algorithms in an online linear optimization setting."
"The sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm and variants thereof are
the de facto standard method for solving large quadratic programs for support
vector machine (SVM) training. In this paper we propose a simple yet powerful
modification. The main emphasis is on an algorithm improving the SMO step size
by planning-ahead. The theoretical analysis ensures its convergence to the
optimum. Experiments involving a large number of datasets were carried out to
demonstrate the superiority of the new algorithm."
"In this work we consider the problem of learning a positive semidefinite
kernel matrix from relative comparisons of the form: ""object A is more similar
to object B than it is to C"", where comparisons are given by humans. Existing
solutions to this problem assume many comparisons are provided to learn a high
quality kernel. However, this can be considered unrealistic for many real-world
tasks since relative assessments require human input, which is often costly or
difficult to obtain. Because of this, only a limited number of these
comparisons may be provided. In this work, we explore methods for aiding the
process of learning a kernel with the help of auxiliary kernels built from more
easily extractable information regarding the relationships among objects. We
propose a new kernel learning approach in which the target kernel is defined as
a conic combination of auxiliary kernels and a kernel whose elements are
learned directly. We formulate a convex optimization to solve for this target
kernel that adds only minor overhead to methods that use no auxiliary
information. Empirical results show that in the presence of few training
relative comparisons, our method can learn kernels that generalize to more
out-of-sample comparisons than methods that do not utilize auxiliary
information, as well as similar methods that learn metrics over objects."
"We analyze the following group learning problem in the context of opinion
diffusion: Consider a network with $M$ users, each facing $N$ options. In a
discrete time setting, at each time step, each user chooses $K$ out of the $N$
options, and receive randomly generated rewards, whose statistics depend on the
options chosen as well as the user itself, and are unknown to the users. Each
user aims to maximize their expected total rewards over a certain time horizon
through an online learning process, i.e., a sequence of exploration (sampling
the return of each option) and exploitation (selecting empirically good
options) steps.
  Within this context we consider two group learning scenarios, (1) users with
uniform preferences and (2) users with diverse preferences, and examine how a
user should construct its learning process to best extract information from
other's decisions and experiences so as to maximize its own reward. Performance
is measured in {\em weak regret}, the difference between the user's total
reward and the reward from a user-specific best single-action policy (i.e.,
always selecting the set of options generating the highest mean rewards for
this user). Within each scenario we also consider two cases: (i) when users
exchange full information, meaning they share the actual rewards they obtained
from their choices, and (ii) when users exchange limited information, e.g.,
only their choices but not rewards obtained from these choices."
"Most metric learning algorithms, as well as Fisher's Discriminant Analysis
(FDA), optimize some cost function of different measures of within-and
between-class distances. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and
several Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithms are based on the SVM large
margin theory. Recently, SVMs have been analyzed from SVM and metric learning,
and to develop new algorithms that build on the strengths of each. Inspired by
the metric learning interpretation of SVM, we develop here a new
metric-learning based SVM framework in which we incorporate metric learning
concepts within SVM. We extend the optimization problem of SVM to include some
measure of the within-class distance and along the way we develop a new
within-class distance measure which is appropriate for SVM. In addition, we
adopt the same approach for MKL and show that it can be also formulated as a
Mahalanobis metric learning problem. Our end result is a number of SVM/MKL
algorithms that incorporate metric learning concepts. We experiment with them
on a set of benchmark datasets and observe important predictive performance
improvements."
"Recently a majorization method for optimizing partition functions of
log-linear models was proposed alongside a novel quadratic variational
upper-bound. In the batch setting, it outperformed state-of-the-art first- and
second-order optimization methods on various learning tasks. We propose a
stochastic version of this bound majorization method as well as a low-rank
modification for high-dimensional data-sets. The resulting stochastic
second-order method outperforms stochastic gradient descent (across variations
and various tunings) both in terms of the number of iterations and computation
time till convergence while finding a better quality parameter setting. The
proposed method bridges first- and second-order stochastic optimization methods
by maintaining a computational complexity that is linear in the data dimension
and while exploiting second order information about the pseudo-global curvature
of the objective function (as opposed to the local curvature in the Hessian)."
"Learning a distance metric from the given training samples plays a crucial
role in many machine learning tasks, and various models and optimization
algorithms have been proposed in the past decade. In this paper, we generalize
several state-of-the-art metric learning methods, such as large margin nearest
neighbor (LMNN) and information theoretic metric learning (ITML), into a kernel
classification framework. First, doublets and triplets are constructed from the
training samples, and a family of degree-2 polynomial kernel functions are
proposed for pairs of doublets or triplets. Then, a kernel classification
framework is established, which can not only generalize many popular metric
learning methods such as LMNN and ITML, but also suggest new metric learning
methods, which can be efficiently implemented, interestingly, by using the
standard support vector machine (SVM) solvers. Two novel metric learning
methods, namely doublet-SVM and triplet-SVM, are then developed under the
proposed framework. Experimental results show that doublet-SVM and triplet-SVM
achieve competitive classification accuracies with state-of-the-art metric
learning methods such as ITML and LMNN but with significantly less training
time."
"We describe a primal-dual framework for the design and analysis of online
convex optimization algorithms for {\em drifting regret}. Existing literature
shows (nearly) optimal drifting regret bounds only for the $\ell_2$ and the
$\ell_1$-norms. Our work provides a connection between these algorithms and the
Online Mirror Descent ($\omd$) updates; one key insight that results from our
work is that in order for these algorithms to succeed, it suffices to have the
gradient of the regularizer to be bounded (in an appropriate norm). For
situations (like for the $\ell_1$ norm) where the vanilla regularizer does not
have this property, we have to {\em shift} the regularizer to ensure this.
Thus, this helps explain the various updates presented in \cite{bansal10,
buchbinder12}. We also consider the online variant of the problem with
1-lookahead, and with movement costs in the $\ell_2$-norm. Our primal dual
approach yields nearly optimal competitive ratios for this problem."
"In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efficiently
from Gibbs distributions. Specifically, we provide means for drawing either
approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs' distributions by introducing low
dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our
approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions.
We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical ""high signal -
high coupling"" regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are
challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds."
"The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm is one of the most
widely-used lazy classifiers because of its simplicity and ease of
implementation. It is considered to be an effective classifier and has many
applications. However, its major drawback is that when sequential search is
used to find the neighbors, it involves high computational cost. Speeding-up
k-NN search is still an active research field. Hwang and Cho have recently
proposed an adaptive cluster-based method for fast Nearest Neighbor searching.
The effectiveness of this method is based on the adjustment of three
parameters. However, the authors evaluated their method by setting specific
parameter values and using only one dataset. In this paper, an extensive
experimental study of this method is presented. The results, which are based on
five real life datasets, illustrate that if the parameters of the method are
carefully defined, one can achieve even better classification performance."
"With the increasing number of mobile Apps developed, they are now closely
integrated into daily life. In this paper, we develop a framework to predict
mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status
of a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial
prerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power
management of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover
two kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of
built-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The
IF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated
as AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to
discover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage
behaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature
selection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the
training data and select those features which need less length to describe the
training data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the
log size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification
model to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the
proposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these
features, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of
dimensionality when using the kNN classifier. We conduct a comprehensive
experimental study based on a real mobile App usage dataset. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive
capability for App usage prediction."
"When belief propagation (BP) converges, it does so to a stationary point of
the Bethe free energy $F$, and is often strikingly accurate. However, it may
converge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was
recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to
return an $\epsilon$-approximation to the global minimum of $F$ in polynomial
time provided the maximum degree $\Delta=O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of
variables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several
results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of $F$,
which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any
degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive)
models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the
important result that approximating $\log$ of the Bethe partition function,
$\log Z_B=-\min F$, for a general model to additive $\epsilon$-accuracy may be
reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem. We explore an application to
predicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the
Bethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge."
"Multiple Kernel Learning(MKL) on Support Vector Machines(SVMs) has been a
popular front of research in recent times due to its success in application
problems like Object Categorization. This success is due to the fact that MKL
has the ability to choose from a variety of feature kernels to identify the
optimal kernel combination. But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to
select the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels
presented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by
Kloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of
kernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not
have a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that
stricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over
these techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to
fine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we
propose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can
strictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL
formulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number
of kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite
and fast as compared to p. We have also provided an efficient Reduced Gradient
Descent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to
converge. Through our experiments on the Caltech101 Object Categorization
dataset, we have also shown that one can achieve better accuracies than the
previous formulations through the right choice of t."
"Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a nonparametric representation of functions.
However, classical GP inference suffers from high computational cost for big
data. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian approach, EigenGP, that learns
both basis dictionary elements--eigenfunctions of a GP prior--and prior
precisions in a sparse finite model. It is well known that, among all
orthogonal basis functions, eigenfunctions can provide the most compact
representation. Unlike other sparse Bayesian finite models where the basis
function has a fixed form, our eigenfunctions live in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space as a finite linear combination of kernel functions. We learn the
dictionary elements--eigenfunctions--and the prior precisions over these
elements as well as all the other hyperparameters from data by maximizing the
model marginal likelihood. We explore computational linear algebra to simplify
the gradient computation significantly. Our experimental results demonstrate
improved predictive performance of EigenGP over alternative sparse GP methods
as well as relevance vector machine."
"Motivated by applications in energy management, this paper presents the
Multi-Armed Risk-Aware Bandit (MARAB) algorithm. With the goal of limiting the
exploration of risky arms, MARAB takes as arm quality its conditional value at
risk. When the user-supplied risk level goes to 0, the arm quality tends toward
the essential infimum of the arm distribution density, and MARAB tends toward
the MIN multi-armed bandit algorithm, aimed at the arm with maximal minimal
value. As a first contribution, this paper presents a theoretical analysis of
the MIN algorithm under mild assumptions, establishing its robustness
comparatively to UCB. The analysis is supported by extensive experimental
validation of MIN and MARAB compared to UCB and state-of-art risk-aware MAB
algorithms on artificial and real-world problems."
"In recent years, there has been growing focus on the study of automated
recommender systems. Music recommendation systems serve as a prominent domain
for such works, both from an academic and a commercial perspective. A
fundamental aspect of music perception is that music is experienced in temporal
context and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a novel
reinforcement-learning framework for music recommendation that does not
recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on
a model of preferences for both songs and song transitions. The model is
learned online and is uniquely adapted for each listener. To reduce exploration
time, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it subsequently
updates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with human participants
using both real song and playlist data. Our results indicate that DJ-MC's
ability to recommend sequences of songs provides a significant improvement over
more straightforward approaches, which do not take transitions into account."
"This paper develops a theory of clustering and coding which combines a
geometric model with a probabilistic model in a principled way. The geometric
model is a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric, ${g}_{ij}({\bf x})$,
which we interpret as a measure of dissimilarity. The probabilistic model
consists of a stochastic process with an invariant probability measure which
matches the density of the sample input data. The link between the two models
is a potential function, $U({\bf x})$, and its gradient, $\nabla U({\bf x})$.
We use the gradient to define the dissimilarity metric, which guarantees that
our measure of dissimilarity will depend on the probability measure. Finally,
we use the dissimilarity metric to define a coordinate system on the embedded
Riemannian manifold, which gives us a low-dimensional encoding of our original
data."
"We propose a novel method for approximate inference in Bayesian networks
(BNs). The idea is to sample data from a BN, learn a latent tree model (LTM)
from the data offline, and when online, make inference with the LTM instead of
the original BN. Because LTMs are tree-structured, inference takes linear time.
In the meantime, they can represent complex relationship among leaf nodes and
hence the approximation accuracy is often good. Empirical evidence shows that
our method can achieve good approximation accuracy at low online computational
cost."
"The paper investigates stochastic resource allocation problems with scarce,
reusable resources and non-preemtive, time-dependent, interconnected tasks.
This approach is a natural generalization of several standard resource
management problems, such as scheduling and transportation problems. First,
reactive solutions are considered and defined as control policies of suitably
reformulated Markov decision processes (MDPs). We argue that this reformulation
has several favorable properties, such as it has finite state and action
spaces, it is aperiodic, hence all policies are proper and the space of control
policies can be safely restricted. Next, approximate dynamic programming (ADP)
methods, such as fitted Q-learning, are suggested for computing an efficient
control policy. In order to compactly maintain the cost-to-go function, two
representations are studied: hash tables and support vector regression (SVR),
particularly, nu-SVRs. Several additional improvements, such as the application
of limited-lookahead rollout algorithms in the initial phases, action space
decomposition, task clustering and distributed sampling are investigated, too.
Finally, experimental results on both benchmark and industry-related data are
presented."
"Machine learning techniques are gaining prevalence in the production of a
wide range of classifiers for complex real-world applications with nonuniform
testing and misclassification costs. The increasing complexity of these
applications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and
classification. In this work we introduce ACT (anytime cost-sensitive tree
learner), a novel framework for operating in such complex environments. ACT is
an anytime algorithm that allows learning time to be increased in return for
lower classification costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional
time resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different
candidate splits. Using sampling techniques, ACT approximates the cost of the
subtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost. As a
stochastic algorithm, ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into
which greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets
were conducted to compare ACT to the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive tree
learners. The results show that for the majority of domains ACT produces
significantly less costly trees. ACT also exhibits good anytime behavior with
diminishing returns."
"In this paper we apply Conformal Prediction (CP) to the k-Nearest Neighbours
Regression (k-NNR) algorithm and propose ways of extending the typical
nonconformity measure used for regression so far. Unlike traditional regression
methods which produce point predictions, Conformal Predictors output predictive
regions that satisfy a given confidence level. The regions produced by any
Conformal Predictor are automatically valid, however their tightness and
therefore usefulness depends on the nonconformity measure used by each CP. In
effect a nonconformity measure evaluates how strange a given example is
compared to a set of other examples based on some traditional machine learning
algorithm. We define six novel nonconformity measures based on the k-Nearest
Neighbours Regression algorithm and develop the corresponding CPs following
both the original (transductive) and the inductive CP approaches. A comparison
of the predictive regions produced by our measures with those of the typical
regression measure suggests that a major improvement in terms of predictive
region tightness is achieved by the new measures."
"Multiclass problems are often decomposed into multiple binary problems that
are solved by individual binary classifiers whose results are integrated into a
final answer. Various methods, including all-pairs (APs), one-versus-all (OVA),
and error correcting output code (ECOC), have been studied, to decompose
multiclass problems into binary problems. However, little study has been made
to optimally aggregate binary problems to determine a final answer to the
multiclass problem. In this paper we present a convex optimization method for
an optimal aggregation of binary classifiers to estimate class membership
probabilities in multiclass problems. We model the class membership probability
as a softmax function which takes a conic combination of discrepancies induced
by individual binary classifiers, as an input. With this model, we formulate
the regularized maximum likelihood estimation as a convex optimization problem,
which is solved by the primal-dual interior point method. Connections of our
method to large margin classifiers are presented, showing that the large margin
formulation can be considered as a limiting case of our convex formulation.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing aggregation methods as well as direct methods,
in terms of the classification accuracy and the quality of class membership
probability estimates."
"Over the past few years, Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) has received significant
attention among data-driven feature selection techniques in the context of
kernel-based learning. MKL formulations have been devised and solved for a
broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including Multi-Task Learning
(MTL). Solving different MKL formulations usually involves designing algorithms
that are tailored to the problem at hand, which is, typically, a non-trivial
accomplishment.
  In this paper we present a general Multi-Task Multi-Kernel Learning
(Multi-Task MKL) framework that subsumes well-known Multi-Task MKL
formulations, as well as several important MKL approaches on single-task
problems. We then derive a simple algorithm that can solve the unifying
framework. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed framework, we
formulate a new learning problem, namely Partially-Shared Common Space (PSCS)
Multi-Task MKL, and demonstrate its merits through experimentation."
"An extreme learning machine (ELM) can be regarded as a two stage feed-forward
neural network (FNN) learning system which randomly assigns the connections
with and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections
with output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially
a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational
burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction
does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that
whether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical
feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part
on this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation
function, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation
sense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show
that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one
hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of
ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically
justify that there also exists an activation function such that the
corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we
prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is
essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use
of ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the
well-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the
generalization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential
characteristic of ELM and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM."
"Non-negative least-mean-square (NNLMS) algorithm and its variants have been
proposed for online estimation under non-negativity constraints. The transient
behavior of the NNLMS, Normalized NNLMS, Exponential NNLMS and Sign-Sign NNLMS
algorithms have been studied in our previous work. In this technical report, we
derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state excess mean-square error
(EMSE) for the four algorithms. Simulations results illustrate the accuracy of
the theoretical results. This is a complementary material to our previous work."
"Distributions over rankings are used to model data in a multitude of real
world settings such as preference analysis and political elections. Modeling
such distributions presents several computational challenges, however, due to
the factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set. Some of these
challenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community, such as
how to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space,
and how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these
representations. With respect to ranking, however, there is the additional
challenge of what we refer to as human task complexity users are rarely willing
to provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates, instead often
preferring to provide partial ranking information. Simultaneously addressing
all of these challenges i.e., designing a compactly representable model which
is amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking
data is a difficult task, but is necessary if we would like to scale to
problems with nontrivial size. In this paper, we show that the recently
proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each
of the above challenges. In particular, we establish a tight mathematical
connection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial
rankings. This correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and
exact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence
based represen- tations with partial rankings, but somewhat surprisingly, also
shows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models
(in a certain sense) with observations which do not take the form of partial
rankings. Finally, using our inference algorithm, we introduce the first method
for learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data."
"Anomaly detection is being regarded as an unsupervised learning task as
anomalies stem from adversarial or unlikely events with unknown distributions.
However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection
often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there
exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first
contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from
a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown
anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on
the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this
requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the
optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions.
Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter
candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection
data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less
labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection
accuracies."
"We study the problem of learning k-juntas given access to examples drawn from
a number of different product distributions. Thus we wish to learn a function f
: {-1,1}^n -> {-1,1} that depends on k (unknown) coordinates. While the best
known algorithms for the general problem of learning a k-junta require running
time of n^k * poly(n,2^k), we show that given access to k different product
distributions with biases separated by \gamma>0, the functions may be learned
in time poly(n,2^k,\gamma^{-k}). More generally, given access to t <= k
different product distributions, the functions may be learned in time n^{k/t} *
poly(n,2^k,\gamma^{-k}). Our techniques involve novel results in Fourier
analysis relating Fourier expansions with respect to different biases and a
generalization of Russo's formula."
"The use of computational intelligence techniques for classification has been
used in numerous applications. This paper compares the use of a Multi Layer
Perceptron Neural Network and a new Relational Network on classifying the HIV
status of women at ante-natal clinics. The paper discusses the architecture of
the relational network and its merits compared to a neural network and most
other computational intelligence classifiers. Results gathered from the study
indicate comparable classification accuracies as well as revealed relationships
between data features in the classification data. Much higher classification
accuracies are recommended for future research in the area of HIV
classification as well as missing data estimation."
"This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an
ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural
diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having
different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical
Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the
classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9
classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the
ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity
measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used
to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to
aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a
diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024
as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number
of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function."
"Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters:
the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this
model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its
leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization
error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time
requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the
leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among
those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It
applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the
2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2,
as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this
machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established."
"This article considers constrained $\ell_1$ minimization methods for the
recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless,
bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given
in these noise settings for two $\ell_1$ minimization methods: the Dantzig
selector and $\ell_1$ minimization with an $\ell_2$ constraint. The results of
this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the
conditions and tightening the error bounds. The improvement on the conditions
shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately. This paper
also establishes connections between restricted isometry property and the
mutual incoherence property. Some results of Candes, Romberg and Tao (2006) and
Donoho, Elad, and Temlyakov (2006) are extended."
"We identify the classical Perceptron algorithm with margin as a member of a
broader family of large margin classifiers which we collectively call the
Margitron. The Margitron, (despite its) sharing the same update rule with the
Perceptron, is shown in an incremental setting to converge in a finite number
of updates to solutions possessing any desirable fraction of the maximum
margin. Experiments comparing the Margitron with decomposition SVMs on tasks
involving linear kernels and 2-norm soft margin are also reported."
"This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sample selection bias
correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine
learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of
a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies
on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We
analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the
hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a
cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the
results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using
these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional
stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much
of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance
weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally
stable algorithm."
"This article describes an approach to designing a distributed and modular
neural classifier. This approach introduces a new hierarchical clustering that
enables one to determine reliable regions in the representation space by
exploiting supervised information. A multilayer perceptron is then associated
with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of
the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global
classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed
by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by
all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit
recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular
classifiers are given."
"Nous pr\'esentons dans cette contribution une approche \`a la fois symbolique

  Methodologically oriented, the present work sketches an approach for prosodic
information retrieval and speech segmentation, based on both symbolic and
probabilistic information. We have recourse to probabilistic grammars, within
which we implement a minimal hierarchical structure. Both the stages of
probabilistic grammar building and its testing in prediction are explored and
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated."
"Statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes,
particularly those with finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The
fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of
samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy. Here we consider
learning over the set of all computable labeling functions. Since the
VC-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples
are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen
sufficient samples to have learned. We first show that learning in this setting
is indeed possible, and develop a learning algorithm. We then show, however,
that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is
impossible. Notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that
the learning algorithm be computable, and not due to the statistical nature of
the problem."
"We prove that the class of functions g:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1} that only depend
on an unknown subset of k<<n variables (so-called k-juntas) is agnostically
learnable from a random walk in time polynomial in n, 2^{k^2}, epsilon^{-k},
and log(1/delta). In other words, there is an algorithm with the claimed
running time that, given epsilon, delta > 0 and access to a random walk on
{-1,+1}^n labeled by an arbitrary function f:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1}, finds with
probability at least 1-delta a k-junta that is (opt(f)+epsilon)-close to f,
where opt(f) denotes the distance of a closest k-junta to f."
"The method of stable random projections is a tool for efficiently computing
the $l_\alpha$ distances using low memory, where $0<\alpha \leq 2$ is a tuning
parameter. The method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various
estimators have been proposed, based on the geometric mean, the harmonic mean,
and the fractional power etc.
  This study proposes the optimal quantile estimator, whose main operation is
selecting, which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power,
the main operation in previous estimators. Our experiments report that the
optimal quantile estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more
computationally efficient than previous estimators. For large-scale learning
tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious
bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable.
  In addition to its computational advantages, the optimal quantile estimator
exhibits nice theoretical properties. It is more accurate than previous
estimators when $\alpha>1$. We derive its theoretical error bounds and
establish the explicit (i.e., no hidden constants) sample complexity bound."
"Applications in machine learning and data mining require computing pairwise
Lp distances in a data matrix A. For massive high-dimensional data, computing
all pairwise distances of A can be infeasible. In fact, even storing A or all
pairwise distances of A in the memory may be also infeasible. This paper
proposes a simple method for p = 2, 4, 6, ... We first decompose the l_p (where
p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products''
at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to
approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms
can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for
applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one
projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative
projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical
analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic
strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are
non-negative, which is common in reality."
"This paper uses the notion of algorithmic stability to derive novel
generalization bounds for several families of transductive regression
algorithms, both by using convexity and closed-form solutions. Our analysis
helps compare the stability of these algorithms. It also shows that a number of
widely used transductive regression algorithms are in fact unstable. Finally,
it reports the results of experiments with local transductive regression
demonstrating the benefit of our stability bounds for model selection, for one
of the algorithms, in particular for determining the radius of the local
neighborhood used by the algorithm."
"Motivation: Several different threads of research have been proposed for
modeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic
Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model
relationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are
intractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as
frequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the
rigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical
models literature.
  Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of
research, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be
inferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the
modeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter.
First, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on
influences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using
a greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN
structure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct
occurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach,
we focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called
excitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can
be conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on
datasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real
neuroscience datasets are presented.

"Introduction to Machine learning covering Statistical Inference (Bayes, EM,
ML/MaxEnt duality), algebraic and spectral methods (PCA, LDA, CCA, Clustering),
and PAC learning (the Formal model, VC dimension, Double Sampling theorem)."
"In this paper, we consider the coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty of
Walley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability
distributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a
categorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state
of prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem,
another state of beliefs, called \emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed.
Near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles
that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows
learning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial
evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the
problem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs.
The key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of
interest that is \emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most
common case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent
variables (and general \emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if
satisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This
condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical
problems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the
possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical
problems."
"Engine assembly is a complex and heavily automated distributed-control
process, with large amounts of faults data logged everyday. We describe an
application of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine
assembly plant. Frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method
that can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs
in an efficient manner. In addition to being theoretically elegant and
computationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the
form actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information
is critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in
the manufacturing domain. We show how domain-specific knowledge can be
incorporated using heuristic rules that act as pre-filters and post-filters to
frequent episode discovery. The system described here is currently being used
in one of the engine assembly plants of General Motors and is planned for
adaptation in other plants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents
the first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the
manufacturing domain. We believe that the ideas presented in this paper can
help practitioners engineer tools for analysis in other similar or related
application domains as well."
"This paper presents a new hybrid learning algorithm for unsupervised
classification tasks. We combined Fuzzy c-means learning algorithm and a
supervised version of Minimerror to develop a hybrid incremental strategy
allowing unsupervised classifications. We applied this new approach to a
real-world database in order to know if the information contained in unlabeled
features of a Geographic Information System (GIS), allows to well classify it.
Finally, we compared our results to a classical supervised classification
obtained by a multilayer perceptron."
"We analyze the expected cost of a greedy active learning algorithm. Our
analysis extends previous work to a more general setting in which different
queries have different costs. Moreover, queries may have more than two possible
responses and the distribution over hypotheses may be non uniform. Specific
applications include active learning with label costs, active learning for
multiclass and partial label queries, and batch mode active learning. We also
discuss an approximate version of interest when there are very many queries."
"We present three related ways of using Transfer Learning to improve feature
selection. The three methods address different problems, and hence share
different kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three
are based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL)
principle and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first
method, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for
multiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features.
MIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models
and is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a
large pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our
second method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case
when the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method,
Transfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task
to which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have
different amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial
when we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of
labeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different
verbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental
results on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD)."
"Many learning machines that have hierarchical structure or hidden variables
are now being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and
bioinformatics. However, several learning machines used in such fields are not
regular but singular statistical models, hence their generalization performance
is still left unknown. To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we
proved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the
Bayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional
variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity
contained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same
equations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric
model. Also we prove that, the proposed equations in a regular case are
asymptotically equivalent to the Takeuchi information criterion. Therefore, the
proposed equations are always applicable without any condition on the unknown
true distribution."
"The problem of classifying sonar signals from rocks and mines first studied
by Gorman and Sejnowski has become a benchmark against which many learning
algorithms have been tested. We show that both the training set and the test
set of this benchmark are linearly separable, although with different
hyperplanes. Moreover, the complete set of learning and test patterns together,
is also linearly separable. We give the weights that separate these sets, which
may be used to compare results found by other algorithms."
"Clusters of genes that have evolved by repeated segmental duplication present
difficult challenges throughout genomic analysis, from sequence assembly to
functional analysis. Improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost
importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary
innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including HIV and a
variety of cancers. Previously, Zhang et al. (2008) developed an algorithm for
reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using
only human genomic sequence data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
model for the evolution of gene clusters on a phylogeny, and an MCMC algorithm
for reconstruction of duplication histories from genomic sequences in multiple
species. Several projects are underway to obtain high quality BAC-based
assemblies of duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that
our method will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets."
"In this paper, we present two classes of Bayesian approaches to the
two-sample problem. Our first class of methods extends the Bayesian t-test to
include all parametric models in the exponential family and their conjugate
priors. Our second class of methods uses Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM) of
such conjugate-exponential distributions as flexible nonparametric priors over
the unknown distributions."
"In this paper, we present the step by step knowledge acquisition process by
choosing a structured method through using a questionnaire as a knowledge
acquisition tool. Here we want to depict the problem domain as, how to evaluate
teachers performance in higher education through the use of expert system
technology. The problem is how to acquire the specific knowledge for a selected
problem efficiently and effectively from human experts and encode it in the
suitable computer format. Acquiring knowledge from human experts in the process
of expert systems development is one of the most common problems cited till
yet. This questionnaire was sent to 87 domain experts within all public and
private universities in Pakistani. Among them 25 domain experts sent their
valuable opinions. Most of the domain experts were highly qualified, well
experienced and highly responsible persons. The whole questionnaire was divided
into 15 main groups of factors, which were further divided into 99 individual
questions. These facts were analyzed further to give a final shape to the
questionnaire. This knowledge acquisition technique may be used as a learning
tool for further research work."
"We describe an adaptation and application of a search-based structured
prediction algorithm ""Searn"" to unsupervised learning problems. We show that it
is possible to reduce unsupervised learning to supervised learning and
demonstrate a high-quality unsupervised shift-reduce parsing model. We
additionally show a close connection between unsupervised Searn and expectation
maximization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a semi-supervised
extension. The key idea that enables this is an application of the predict-self
idea for unsupervised learning."
"The maze traversal problem (finding the shortest distance to the goal from
any position in a maze) has been an interesting challenge in computational
intelligence. Recent work has shown that the cellular simultaneous recurrent
neural network (CSRN) can solve this problem for simple mazes. This thesis
focuses on exploiting relevant information about the maze to improve learning
and decrease the training time for the CSRN to solve mazes. Appropriate
variables are identified to create useful clusters using relevant information.
The CSRN was next modified to allow for an additional external input. With this
additional input, several methods were tested and results show that clustering
the mazes improves the overall learning of the traversal problem for the CSRN."
"We present a new latent-variable model employing a Gaussian mixture
integrated with a feature selection procedure (the Bernoulli part of the model)
which together form a ""Latent Bernoulli-Gauss"" distribution. The model is
applied to MAP estimation, clustering, feature selection and collaborative
filtering and fares favorably with the state-of-the-art latent-variable models."
"We address in this paper the problem of multi-channel signal sequence
labeling. In particular, we consider the problem where the signals are
contaminated by noise or may present some dephasing with respect to their
labels. For that, we propose to jointly learn a SVM sample classifier with a
temporal filtering of the channels. This will lead to a large margin filtering
that is adapted to the specificity of each channel (noise and time-lag). We
derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem and we discuss different
filter regularizations for automated scaling or selection of channels. Our
approach is tested on a non-linear toy example and on a BCI dataset. Results
show that the classification performance on these problems can be improved by
learning a large margin filtering."
"We show that the learning sample complexity of a sigmoidal neural network
constructed by Sontag (1992) required to achieve a given misclassification
error under a fixed purely atomic distribution can grow arbitrarily fast: for
any prescribed rate of growth there is an input distribution having this rate
as the sample complexity, and the bound is asymptotically tight. The rate can
be superexponential, a non-recursive function, etc. We further observe that
Sontag's ANN is not Glivenko-Cantelli under any input distribution having a
non-atomic part."
"This paper introduces a principled approach for the design of a scalable
general reinforcement learning agent. This approach is based on a direct
approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement
learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI
could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto open
question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible
approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a
Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension of the
Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging
results on a number of stochastic, unknown, and partially observable domains."
"Search engines today present results that are often oblivious to abrupt
shifts in intent. For example, the query `independence day' usually refers to a
US holiday, but the intent of this query abruptly changed during the release of
a major film by that name. While no studies exactly quantify the magnitude of
intent-shifting traffic, studies suggest that news events, seasonal topics, pop
culture, etc account for 50% of all search queries. This paper shows that the
signals a search engine receives can be used to both determine that a shift in
intent has happened, as well as find a result that is now more relevant. We
present a meta-algorithm that marries a classifier with a bandit algorithm to
achieve regret that depends logarithmically on the number of query impressions,
under certain assumptions. We provide strong evidence that this regret is close
to the best achievable. Finally, via a series of experiments, we demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms prior approaches, particularly as the amount of
intent-shifting traffic increases."
"Recently, applying the novel data mining techniques for evaluating enterprise
financial distress has received much research alternation. Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and back propagation neural (BPN) network has been applied
successfully in many areas with excellent generalization results, such as rule
extraction, classification and evaluation. In this paper, a model based on SVM
with Gaussian RBF kernel is proposed here for enterprise financial distress
evaluation. BPN network is considered one of the simplest and are most general
methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural network. The
comparative results show that through the difference between the performance
measures is marginal; SVM gives higher precision and lower error rates."
"Most image-search approaches today are based on the text based tags
associated with the images which are mostly human generated and are subject to
various kinds of errors. The results of a query to the image database thus can
often be misleading and may not satisfy the requirements of the user. In this
work we propose our approach to automate this tagging process of images, where
image results generated can be fine filtered based on a probabilistic tagging
mechanism. We implement a tool which helps to automate the tagging process by
maintaining a training database, wherein the system is trained to identify
certain set of input images, the results generated from which are used to
create a probabilistic tagging mechanism. Given a certain set of segments in an
image it calculates the probability of presence of particular keywords. This
probability table is further used to generate the candidate tags for input
images."
"We present a framework for discriminative sequence classification where the
learner works directly in the high dimensional predictor space of all
subsequences in the training set. This is possible by employing a new
coordinate-descent algorithm coupled with bounding the magnitude of the
gradient for selecting discriminative subsequences fast. We characterize the
loss functions for which our generic learning algorithm can be applied and
present concrete implementations for logistic regression (binomial
log-likelihood loss) and support vector machines (squared hinge loss).
Application of our algorithm to protein remote homology detection and remote
fold recognition results in performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art
methods (e.g., kernel support vector machines). Unlike state-of-the-art
classifiers, the resulting classification models are simply lists of weighted
discriminative subsequences and can thus be interpreted and related to the
biological problem."
"We present three generalisations of Kernel Principal Components Analysis
(KPCA) which incorporate knowledge of the class labels of a subset of the data
points. The first, MV-KPCA, penalises within class variances similar to Fisher
discriminant analysis. The second, LSKPCA is a hybrid of least squares
regression and kernel PCA. The final LR-KPCA is an iteratively reweighted
version of the previous which achieves a sigmoid loss function on the labeled
points. We provide a theoretical risk bound as well as illustrative experiments
on real and toy data sets."
"In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is
considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be
bounded in advance. We present some modification of Kalai and Vempala algorithm
of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the
experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled fluctuation of a game are
introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly
large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case
when the scaled fluctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to
zero."
"In prediction with expert advice the goal is to design online prediction
algorithms that achieve small regret (additional loss on the whole data)
compared to a reference scheme. In the simplest such scheme one compares to the
loss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the
data into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is
appropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard
fixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this
scheme.
  Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about
how they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the
following question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from
data in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first
case. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly
when the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending
fixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T
outcomes. We show, however, that no such slowdown is necessary if the experts
are hidden Markov models."
"A problem posed by Freund is how to efficiently track a small pool of experts
out of a much larger set. This problem was solved when Bousquet and Warmuth
introduced their mixing past posteriors (MPP) algorithm in 2001.
  In Freund's problem the experts would normally be considered black boxes.
However, in this paper we re-examine Freund's problem in case the experts have
internal structure that enables them to learn. In this case the problem has two
possible interpretations: should the experts learn from all data or only from
the subsequence on which they are being tracked? The MPP algorithm solves the
first case. Our contribution is to generalise MPP to address the second option.
The results we obtain apply to any expert structure that can be formalised
using (expert) hidden Markov models. Curiously enough, for our interpretation
there are \emph{two} natural reference schemes: freezing and sleeping. For each
scheme, we provide an efficient prediction strategy and prove the relevant loss
bound."
"Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods (AGM) have been successfully applied
in many machine learning areas. However, their empirical performance on
training max-margin models has been inferior to existing specialized solvers.
In this paper, we first extend AGM to strongly convex and composite objective
functions with Bregman style prox-functions. Our unifying framework covers both
the $\infty$-memory and 1-memory styles of AGM, tunes the Lipschiz constant
adaptively, and bounds the duality gap. Then we demonstrate various ways to
apply this framework of methods to a wide range of machine learning problems.
Emphasis will be given on their rate of convergence and how to efficiently
compute the gradient and optimize the models. The experimental results show
that with our extensions AGM outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on max-margin
models."
"An importance weight quantifies the relative importance of one example over
another, coming up in applications of boosting, asymmetric classification
costs, reductions, and active learning. The standard approach for dealing with
importance weights in gradient descent is via multiplication of the gradient.
We first demonstrate the problems of this approach when importance weights are
large, and argue in favor of more sophisticated ways for dealing with them. We
then develop an approach which enjoys an invariance property: that updating
twice with importance weight $h$ is equivalent to updating once with importance
weight $2h$. For many important losses this has a closed form update which
satisfies standard regret guarantees when all examples have $h=1$. We also
briefly discuss two other reasonable approaches for handling large importance
weights. Empirically, these approaches yield substantially superior prediction
with similar computational performance while reducing the sensitivity of the
algorithm to the exact setting of the learning rate. We apply these to online
active learning yielding an extraordinarily fast active learning algorithm that
works even in the presence of adversarial noise."
"The note presents a modified proof of a loss bound for the exponentially
weighted average forecaster with time-varying potential. The regret term of the
algorithm is upper-bounded by sqrt{n ln(N)} (uniformly in n), where N is the
number of experts and n is the number of steps."
"It is a challenging task to select correlated variables in a high dimensional
space. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and
successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the
elastic net does not explicitly use correlation information embedded in data to
select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel
Bayesian hybrid model, the EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to
guide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional
classification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in
a principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the
eigenspace to avoid overfiting and to increase the computational efficiency of
its MCMC sampler. Furthermore, we provide an alternative view to the EigenNet
from a regularization perspective: the EigenNet has an adaptive
eigenspace-based composite regularizer, which naturally generalizes the
$l_{1/2}$ regularizer used by the elastic net. Experiments on synthetic and
real data show that the EigenNet significantly outperforms the lasso, the
elastic net, and the Bayesian lasso in terms of prediction accuracy, especially
when the number of training samples is smaller than the number of variables."
"Ordinal regression is commonly formulated as a multi-class problem with
ordinal constraints. The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for
ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due
to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of
ordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to
obtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater
abundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of
unlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for
ordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR).
The key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both
the ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the
ordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include
an objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions
casted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label
swapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective
function value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used
benchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are
then presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed
transductive ordinal regression. Further, comparisons to recent
state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced
transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and
improved performance."
"Many studies on the cost-sensitive learning assumed that a unique cost matrix
is known for a problem. However, this assumption may not hold for many
real-world problems. For example, a classifier might need to be applied in
several circumstances, each of which associates with a different cost matrix.
Or, different human experts have different opinions about the costs for a given
problem. Motivated by these facts, this study aims to seek the minimax
classifier over multiple cost matrices. In summary, we theoretically proved
that, no matter how many cost matrices are involved, the minimax problem can be
tackled by solving a number of standard cost-sensitive problems and
sub-problems that involve only two cost matrices. As a result, a general
framework for achieving minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices is
suggested and justified by preliminary empirical studies."
"Multiple instance learning (MIL) has attracted great attention recently in
machine learning community. However, most MIL algorithms are very slow and
cannot be applied to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a greedy
strategy to speed up the multiple instance learning process. Our contribution
is two fold. First, we propose a density ratio model, and show that maximizing
a density ratio function is the low bound of the DD model under certain
conditions. Secondly, we make use of a histogram ratio between positive bags
and negative bags to represent the density ratio function and find codebooks
separately for positive bags and negative bags by a greedy strategy. For
testing, we make use of a nearest neighbor strategy to classify new bags. We
test our method on both small benchmark datasets and the large TRECVID MED11
dataset. The experimental results show that our method yields comparable
accuracy to the current state of the art, while being up to at least one order
of magnitude faster."
"We present a converged algorithm for Tikhonov regularized nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF). We specially choose this regularization because it is
known that Tikhonov regularized least square (LS) is the more preferable form
in solving linear inverse problems than the conventional LS. Because an NMF
problem can be decomposed into LS subproblems, it can be expected that Tikhonov
regularized NMF will be the more appropriate approach in solving NMF problems.
The algorithm is derived using additive update rules which have been shown to
have convergence guarantee. We equip the algorithm with a mechanism to
automatically determine the regularization parameters based on the L-curve, a
well-known concept in the inverse problems community, but is rather unknown in
the NMF research. The introduction of this algorithm thus solves two inherent
problems in Tikhonov regularized NMF algorithm research, i.e., convergence
guarantee and regularization parameters determination."
"Online learning constitutes a mathematical and compelling framework to
analyze sequential decision making problems in adversarial environments. The
learner repeatedly chooses an action, the environment responds with an outcome,
and then the learner receives a reward for the played action. The goal of the
learner is to maximize his total reward. However, there are situations in
which, in addition to maximizing the cumulative reward, there are some
additional constraints on the sequence of decisions that must be satisfied on
average by the learner. In this paper we study an extension to the online
learning where the learner aims to maximize the total reward given that some
additional constraints need to be satisfied. By leveraging on the theory of
Lagrangian method in constrained optimization, we propose Lagrangian
exponentially weighted average (LEWA) algorithm, which is a primal-dual variant
of the well known exponentially weighted average algorithm, to efficiently
solve constrained online decision making problems. Using novel theoretical
analysis, we establish the regret and the violation of the constraint bounds in
full information and bandit feedback models."
"Despite the widespread use of Clustering, there is distressingly little
general theory of clustering available. Questions like ""What distinguishes a
clustering of data from other data partitioning?"", ""Are there any principles
governing all clustering paradigms?"", ""How should a user choose an appropriate
clustering algorithm for a particular task?"", etc. are almost completely
unanswered by the existing body of clustering literature. We consider an
axiomatic approach to the theory of Clustering. We adopt the framework of
Kleinberg, [Kle03]. By relaxing one of Kleinberg's clustering axioms, we
sidestep his impossibility result and arrive at a consistent set of axioms. We
suggest to extend these axioms, aiming to provide an axiomatic taxonomy of
clustering paradigms. Such a taxonomy should provide users some guidance
concerning the choice of the appropriate clustering paradigm for a given task.
The main result of this paper is a set of abstract properties that characterize
the Single-Linkage clustering function. This characterization result provides
new insight into the properties of desired data groupings that make
Single-Linkage the appropriate choice. We conclude by considering a taxonomy of
clustering functions based on abstract properties that each satisfies."
"A quantile binary classifier uses the rule: Classify x as +1 if P(Y = 1|X =
x) >= t, and as -1 otherwise, for a fixed quantile parameter t {[0, 1]. It has
been shown that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the limit are quantile
classifiers with t = 1/2 . In this paper, we show that by using asymmetric cost
of misclassification SVMs can be appropriately extended to recover, in the
limit, the quantile binary classifier for any t. We then present a principled
algorithm to solve the extended SVM classifier for all values of t
simultaneously. This has two implications: First, one can recover the entire
conditional distribution P(Y = 1|X = x) = t for t {[0, 1]. Second, we can build
a risk-agnostic SVM classifier where the cost of misclassification need not be
known apriori. Preliminary numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm."
"We consider MAP estimators for structured prediction with exponential family
models. In particular, we concentrate on the case that efficient algorithms for
uniform sampling from the output space exist. We show that under this
assumption (i) exact computation of the partition function remains a hard
problem, and (ii) the partition function and the gradient of the log partition
function can be approximated efficiently. Our main result is an approximation
scheme for the partition function based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo theory. We
also show that the efficient uniform sampling assumption holds in several
application settings that are of importance in machine learning."
"We provide an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret rate in an unknown
weakly communicating Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm proceeds in
episodes where, in each episode, it picks a policy using regularization based
on the span of the optimal bias vector. For an MDP with S states and A actions
whose optimal bias vector has span bounded by H, we show a regret bound of
~O(HSpAT). We also relate the span to various diameter-like quantities
associated with the MDP, demonstrating how our results improve on previous
regret bounds."
"We present a modular approach to reinforcement learning that uses a Bayesian
representation of the uncertainty over models. The approach, BOSS (Best of
Sampled Set), drives exploration by sampling multiple models from the posterior
and selecting actions optimistically. It extends previous work by providing a
rule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show that
our algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a sample
complexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posterior
distribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quite
favorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches and
illustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model that
generalizes across states."
"We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where the decision maker can explore
and exploit different arms at every round. The exploited arm adds to the
decision maker's cumulative reward (without necessarily observing the reward)
while the explored arm reveals its value. We devise algorithms for this setup
and show that the dependence on the number of arms, k, can be much better than
the standard square root of k dependence, depending on the behavior of the
arms' reward sequences. For the important case of piecewise stationary
stochastic bandits, we show a significant improvement over existing algorithms.
Our algorithms are based on a non-uniform sampling policy, which we show is
essential to the success of any algorithm in the adversarial setup. Finally, we
show some simulation results on an ultra-wide band channel selection inspired
setting indicating the applicability of our algorithms."
"We are concerned with the issue of how to calculate the normalized maximum
likelihood (NML) code-length. There is a problem that the normalization term of
the NML code-length may diverge when it is continuous and unbounded and a
straightforward computation of it is highly expensive when the data domain is
finite . In previous works it has been investigated how to calculate the NML
code-length for specific types of distributions. We first propose a general
method for computing the NML code-length for the exponential family. Then we
specifically focus on Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and propose a new efficient
method for computing the NML to them. We develop it by generalizing Rissanen's
re-normalizing technique. Then we apply this method to the clustering issue, in
which a clustering structure is modeled using a GMM, and the main task is to
estimate the optimal number of clusters on the basis of the NML code-length. We
demonstrate using artificial data sets the superiority of the NML-based
clustering over other criteria such as AIC, BIC in terms of the data size
required for high accuracy rate to be achieved."
"This paper describes the method of visualization of periodic constituents and
instability areas in series of measurements, being based on the algorithm of
smoothing out and concept of one-dimensional cellular automata. A method can be
used at the analysis of temporal series, related to the volumes of thematic
publications in web-space."
"We introduce into the classical perceptron algorithm with margin a mechanism
that shrinks the current weight vector as a first step of the update. If the
shrinking factor is constant the resulting algorithm may be regarded as a
margin-error-driven version of NORMA with constant learning rate. In this case
we show that the allowed strength of shrinking depends on the value of the
maximum margin. We also consider variable shrinking factors for which there is
no such dependence. In both cases we obtain new generalizations of the
perceptron with margin able to provably attain in a finite number of steps any
desirable approximation of the maximal margin hyperplane. The new approximate
maximum margin classifiers appear experimentally to be very competitive in
2-norm soft margin tasks involving linear kernels."
"In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn how
to perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong
exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The
essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other
state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration
algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited
before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems
would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most
physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we
address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We
first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that
imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed
safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed
safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization
formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the
guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our
framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration
methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a
Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore
better than classical exploration methods."
"This paper presents the first actor-critic algorithm for off-policy
reinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its
per-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights.
Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting
and does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradient
temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable
a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another
(behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more
practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly
represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a
large action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the
generality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility
in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental,
linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces,
prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms,
and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on
standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems."
"We theoretically analyze and compare the following five popular multiclass
classification methods: One vs. All, All Pairs, Tree-based classifiers, Error
Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) with randomly generated code matrices, and
Multiclass SVM. In the first four methods, the classification is based on a
reduction to binary classification. We consider the case where the binary
classifier comes from a class of VC dimension $d$, and in particular from the
class of halfspaces over $\reals^d$. We analyze both the estimation error and
the approximation error of these methods. Our analysis reveals interesting
conclusions of practical relevance, regarding the success of the different
approaches under various conditions. Our proof technique employs tools from VC
theory to analyze the \emph{approximation error} of hypothesis classes. This is
in sharp contrast to most, if not all, previous uses of VC theory, which only
deal with estimation error."
"Multiple datasets containing different types of features may be available for
a given task. For instance, users' profiles can be used to group users for
recommendation systems. In addition, a model can also use users' historical
behaviors and credit history to group users. Each dataset contains different
information and suffices for learning. A number of clustering algorithms on
multiple datasets were proposed during the past few years. These algorithms
assume that at least one dataset is complete. So far as we know, all the
previous methods will not be applicable if there is no complete dataset
available. However, in reality, there are many situations where no dataset is
complete. As in building a recommendation system, some new users may not have a
profile or historical behaviors, while some may not have a credit history.
Hence, no available dataset is complete. In order to solve this problem, we
propose an approach called Collective Kernel Learning to infer hidden sample
similarity from multiple incomplete datasets. The idea is to collectively
completes the kernel matrices of incomplete datasets by optimizing the
alignment of the shared instances of the datasets. Furthermore, a clustering
algorithm is proposed based on the kernel matrix. The experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. The proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the comparison
algorithms by as much as two times in normalized mutual information."
"In many real-world tasks, particularly those involving data objects with
complicated semantics such as images and texts, one object can be represented
by multiple instances and simultaneously be associated with multiple labels.
Such tasks can be formulated as multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML)
problems, and have been extensively studied during the past few years. Existing
MIML approaches have been found useful in many applications; however, most of
them can only handle moderate-sized data. To efficiently handle large data
sets, in this paper we propose the MIMLfast approach, which first constructs a
low-dimensional subspace shared by all labels, and then trains label specific
linear models to optimize approximated ranking loss via stochastic gradient
descent. Although the MIML problem is complicated, MIMLfast is able to achieve
excellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and
discovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the
performance of MIMLfast is highly competitive to state-of-the-art techniques,
whereas its time cost is much less; particularly, on a data set with 20K bags
and 180K instances, MIMLfast is more than 100 times faster than existing MIML
approaches. On a larger data set where none of existing approaches can return
results in 24 hours, MIMLfast takes only 12 minutes. Moreover, our approach is
able to identify the most representative instance for each label, and thus
providing a chance to understand the relation between input patterns and output
label semantics."
"In this paper, we present two localized graph filtering based methods for
interpolating graph signals defined on the vertices of arbitrary graphs from
only a partial set of samples. The first method is an extension of previous
work on reconstructing bandlimited graph signals from partially observed
samples. The iterative graph filtering approach very closely approximates the
solution proposed in the that work, while being computationally more efficient.
As an alternative, we propose a regularization based framework in which we
define the cost of reconstruction to be a combination of smoothness of the
graph signal and the reconstruction error with respect to the known samples,
and find solutions that minimize this cost. We provide both a closed form
solution and a computationally efficient iterative solution of the optimization
problem. The experimental results on the recommendation system datasets
demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methods."
"Graph-based Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully
used in a large number of applications. These methods classify initially
unlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph
starting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly
with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node.
Unfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with
very large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In
this paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which
compactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a
randomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under
mild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m)
to O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support
our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe
that MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art
graph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at
the same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-SKETCH is able to
scale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of
existing graph- based SSL algorithms."
"We present a general framework to learn functions in tensor product
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (TP-RKHSs). The methodology is based on a
novel representer theorem suitable for existing as well as new spectral
penalties for tensors. When the functions in the TP-RKHS are defined on the
Cartesian product of finite discrete sets, in particular, our main problem
formulation admits as a special case existing tensor completion problems. Other
special cases include transfer learning with multimodal side information and
multilinear multitask learning. For the latter case, our kernel-based view is
instrumental to derive nonlinear extensions of existing model classes. We give
a novel algorithm and show in experiments the usefulness of the proposed
extensions."
"We consider the multiarm bandit problems in the timevarying dynamic system
for rich structural features. For the nonlinear dynamic model, we propose the
approximate inference for the posterior distributions based on Laplace
Approximation. For the context bandit problems, Thompson Sampling is adopted
based on the underlying posterior distributions of the parameters. More
specifically, we introduce the discount decays on the previous samples impact
and analyze the different decay rates with the underlying sample dynamics.
Consequently, the exploration and exploitation is adaptively tradeoff according
to the dynamics in the system."
"Clustering trajectory data attracted considerable attention in the last few
years. Most of prior work assumed that moving objects can move freely in an
euclidean space and did not consider the eventual presence of an underlying
road network and its influence on evaluating the similarity between
trajectories. In this paper, we present an approach to clustering such
network-constrained trajectory data. More precisely we aim at discovering
groups of road segments that are often travelled by the same trajectories. To
achieve this end, we model the interactions between segments w.r.t. their
similarity as a weighted graph to which we apply a community detection
algorithm to discover meaningful clusters. We showcase our proposition through
experimental results obtained on synthetic datasets."
"In this paper we propose a multi-task linear classifier learning problem
called D-SVM (Dictionary SVM). D-SVM uses a dictionary of parameter covariance
shared by all tasks to do multi-task knowledge transfer among different tasks.
We formally define the learning problem of D-SVM and show two interpretations
of this problem, from both the probabilistic and kernel perspectives. From the
probabilistic perspective, we show that our learning formulation is actually a
MAP estimation on all optimization variables. We also show its equivalence to a
multiple kernel learning problem in which one is trying to find a re-weighting
kernel for features from a dictionary of basis (despite the fact that only
linear classifiers are learned). Finally, we describe an alternative
optimization scheme to minimize the objective function and present empirical
studies to valid our algorithm."
"Second-price auctions with reserve play a critical role for modern search
engine and popular online sites since the revenue of these companies often
directly de- pends on the outcome of such auctions. The choice of the reserve
price is the main mechanism through which the auction revenue can be influenced
in these electronic markets. We cast the problem of selecting the reserve price
to optimize revenue as a learning problem and present a full theoretical
analysis dealing with the complex properties of the corresponding loss
function. We further give novel algorithms for solving this problem and report
the results of several experiments in both synthetic and real data
demonstrating their effectiveness."
"We present an extensive analysis of relative deviation bounds, including
detailed proofs of two-sided inequalities and their implications. We also give
detailed proofs of two-sided generalization bounds that hold in the general
case of unbounded loss functions, under the assumption that a moment of the
loss is bounded. These bounds are useful in the analysis of importance
weighting and other learning tasks such as unbounded regression."
"We propose an efficient optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of
training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm
estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective,
either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time
complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to
large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical
evaluation shows state-of-art performance in discrete cases and competitive
results in the continuous case."
"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a ubiquitous tool with many
applications in machine learning including feature construction, subspace
embedding, and outlier detection. In this paper, we present an algorithm for
computing the top principal components of a dataset with a large number of rows
(examples) and columns (features). Our algorithm leverages both structured and
unstructured random projections to retain good accuracy while being
computationally efficient. We demonstrate the technique on the winning
submission the KDD 2010 Cup."
"Sophisticated automatic incident detection (AID) technology plays a key role
in contemporary transportation systems. Though many papers were devoted to
study incident classification algorithms, few study investigated how to enhance
feature representation of incidents to improve AID performance. In this paper,
we propose to use an unsupervised feature learning algorithm to generate higher
level features to represent incidents. We used real incident data in the
experiments and found that effective feature mapping function can be learnt
from the data crosses the test sites. With the enhanced features, detection
rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR) and mean time to detect (MTTD) are
significantly improved in all of the three representative cases. This approach
also provides an alternative way to reduce the amount of labeled data, which is
expensive to obtain, required in training better incident classifiers since the
feature learning is unsupervised."
"Scalable machine learning over big data is an important problem that is
receiving a lot of attention in recent years. On popular distributed
environments such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity machines,
communication costs are substantial and algorithms need to be designed suitably
considering those costs. In this paper we give a novel approach to the
distributed training of linear classifiers (involving smooth losses and L2
regularization) that is designed to reduce the total communication costs. At
each iteration, the nodes minimize locally formed approximate objective
functions; then the resulting minimizers are combined to form a descent
direction to move. Our approach gives a lot of freedom in the formation of the
approximate objective function as well as in the choice of methods to solve
them. The method is shown to have $O(log(1/\epsilon))$ time convergence. The
method can be viewed as an iterative parameter mixing method. A special
instantiation yields a parallel stochastic gradient descent method with strong
convergence. When communication times between nodes are large, our method is
much faster than the Terascale method (Agarwal et al., 2011), which is a state
of the art distributed solver based on the statistical query model (Chuet al.,
2006) that computes function and gradient values in a distributed fashion. We
also evaluate against other recent distributed methods and demonstrate superior
performance of our method."
"We present new methods for multilabel classification, relying on ensemble
learning on a collection of random output graphs imposed on the multilabel and
a kernel-based structured output learner as the base classifier. For ensemble
learning, differences among the output graphs provide the required base
classifier diversity and lead to improved performance in the increasing size of
the ensemble. We study different methods of forming the ensemble prediction,
including majority voting and two methods that perform inferences over the
graph structures before or after combining the base models into the ensemble.
We compare the methods against the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches
on a set of heterogeneous multilabel benchmark problems, including multilabel
AdaBoost, convex multitask feature learning, as well as single target learning
approaches represented by Bagging and SVM. In our experiments, the random graph
ensembles are very competitive and robust, ranking first or second on most of
the datasets. Overall, our results show that random graph ensembles are viable
alternatives to flat multilabel and multitask learners."
"Many kernel methods suffer from high time and space complexities and are thus
prohibitive in big-data applications. To tackle the computational challenge,
the Nystr\""om method has been extensively used to reduce time and space
complexities by sacrificing some accuracy. The Nystr\""om method speedups
computation by constructing an approximation of the kernel matrix using only a
few columns of the matrix. Recently, a variant of the Nystr\""om method called
the modified Nystr\""om method has demonstrated significant improvement over the
standard Nystr\""om method in approximation accuracy, both theoretically and
empirically.
  In this paper, we propose two algorithms that make the modified Nystr\""om
method practical. First, we devise a simple column selection algorithm with a
provable error bound. Our algorithm is more efficient and easier to implement
than and nearly as accurate as the state-of-the-art algorithm. Second, with the
selected columns at hand, we propose an algorithm that computes the
approximation in lower time complexity than the approach in the previous work.
Furthermore, we prove that the modified Nystr\""om method is exact under certain
conditions, and we establish a lower error bound for the modified Nystr\""om
method."
"In this paper, we present a computational technique to deal with uncertainty
in dynamic continuous models in Social Sciences. Considering data from surveys,
the method consists of determining the probability distribution of the survey
output and this allows to sample data and fit the model to the sampled data
using a goodness-of-fit criterion based on the chi-square-test. Taking the
fitted parameters non-rejected by the chi-square-test, substituting them into
the model and computing their outputs, we build 95% confidence intervals in
each time instant capturing uncertainty of the survey data (probabilistic
estimation). Using the same set of obtained model parameters, we also provide a
prediction over the next few years with 95% confidence intervals (probabilistic
prediction). This technique is applied to a dynamic social model describing the
evolution of the attitude of the Basque Country population towards the
revolutionary organization ETA."
"The true process that generated data cannot be determined when multiple
explanations are possible. Prediction requires a model of the probability that
a process, chosen randomly from the set of candidate explanations, generates
some future observation. The best model includes all of the information
contained in the minimal description of the data that is not contained in the
data. It is closely related to the Halting Problem and is logarithmic in the
size of the data. Prediction is difficult because the ideal model is not
computable, and the best computable model is not ""findable."" However, the error
from any approximation can be bounded by the size of the description using the
model."
"The Bayesian Classification represents a supervised learning method as well
as a statistical method for classification. Assumes an underlying probabilistic
model and it allows us to capture uncertainty about the model in a principled
way by determining probabilities of the outcomes. This Classification is named
after Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), who proposed the Bayes Theorem. Bayesian
classification provides practical learning algorithms and prior knowledge and
observed data can be combined. Bayesian Classification provides a useful
perspective for understanding and evaluating many learning algorithms. It
calculates explicit probabilities for hypothesis and it is robust to noise in
input data. In statistical classification the Bayes classifier minimises the
probability of misclassification. That was a visual intuition for a simple case
of the Bayes classifier, also called: 1)Idiot Bayes 2)Naive Bayes 3)Simple
Bayes"
"In this paper, we evaluate the performance of various parallel optimization
methods for Kernel Support Vector Machines on multicore CPUs and GPUs. In
particular, we provide the first comparison of algorithms with explicit and
implicit parallelization. Most existing parallel implementations for multi-core
or GPU architectures are based on explicit parallelization of Sequential
Minimal Optimization (SMO)---the programmers identified parallelizable
components and hand-parallelized them, specifically tuned for a particular
architecture. We compare these approaches with each other and with implicitly
parallelized algorithms---where the algorithm is expressed such that most of
the work is done within few iterations with large dense linear algebra
operations. These can be computed with highly-optimized libraries, that are
carefully parallelized for a large variety of parallel platforms. We highlight
the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and compare them on various
benchmark data sets. We find an approximate implicitly parallel algorithm which
is surprisingly efficient, permits a much simpler implementation, and leads to
unprecedented speedups in SVM training."
"We present the \textit{hierarchical Dirichlet scaling process} (HDSP), a
Bayesian nonparametric mixed membership model. The HDSP generalizes the
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model the correlation structure between
metadata in the corpus and mixture components. We construct the HDSP based on
the normalized gamma representation of the Dirichlet process, and this
construction allows incorporating a scaling function that controls the
membership probabilities of the mixture components. We develop two scaling
methods to demonstrate that different modeling assumptions can be expressed in
the HDSP. We also derive the corresponding approximate posterior inference
algorithms using variational Bayes. Through experiments on datasets of
newswire, medical journal articles, conference proceedings, and product
reviews, we show that the HDSP results in a better predictive performance than
labeled LDA, partially labeled LDA, and author topic model and a better
negative review classification performance than the supervised topic model and
SVM."
"In this paper we have focused on an efficient feature selection method in
classification of audio files. The main objective is feature selection and
extraction. We have selected a set of features for further analysis, which
represents the elements in feature vector. By extraction method we can compute
a numerical representation that can be used to characterize the audio using the
existing toolbox. In this study Gain Ratio (GR) is used as a feature selection
measure. GR is used to select splitting attribute which will separate the
tuples into different classes. The pulse clarity is considered as a subjective
measure and it is used to calculate the gain of features of audio files. The
splitting criterion is employed in the application to identify the class or the
music genre of a specific audio file from testing database. Experimental
results indicate that by using GR the application can produce a satisfactory
result for music genre classification. After dimensionality reduction best
three features have been selected out of various features of audio file and in
this technique we will get more than 90% successful classification result."
"Analysis of high dimensional noisy data is of essence across a variety of
research fields. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant
feature subset that can facilitate classification or pattern detection.
Traditional (supervised) feature selection methods utilize label information to
guide the identification of relevant feature subsets. In this paper, however,
we consider the unsupervised feature selection problem. Without the label
information, it is particularly difficult to identify a small set of relevant
features due to the noisy nature of real-world data which corrupts the
intrinsic structure of the data. Our Gradient-based Laplacian Feature Selection
(GLFS) selects important features by minimizing the variance of the Laplacian
regularized least squares regression model. With $\ell_1$ relaxation, GLFS can
find a sparse subset of features that is relevant to the Laplacian manifolds.
Extensive experiments on simulated, three real-world object recognition and two
computational biology datasets, have illustrated the power and superior
performance of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised feature
selection methods. Additionally, we show that GLFS selects a sparser set of
more relevant features in a supervised setting outperforming the popular
elastic net methodology."
"A traditional and intuitively appealing Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning
(MT-MKL) method is to optimize the sum (thus, the average) of objective
functions with (partially) shared kernel function, which allows information
sharing amongst tasks. We point out that the obtained solution corresponds to a
single point on the Pareto Front (PF) of a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)
problem, which considers the concurrent optimization of all task objectives
involved in the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. Motivated by this last
observation and arguing that the former approach is heuristic, we propose a
novel Support Vector Machine (SVM) MT-MKL framework, that considers an
implicitly-defined set of conic combinations of task objectives. We show that
solving our framework produces solutions along a path on the aforementioned PF
and that it subsumes the optimization of the average of objective functions as
a special case. Using algorithms we derived, we demonstrate through a series of
experimental results that the framework is capable of achieving better
classification performance, when compared to other similar MTL approaches."
"This work presents a sound probabilistic method for enforcing adherence of
the marginal probabilities of a multi-label model to automatically discovered
deterministic relationships among labels. In particular we focus on discovering
two kinds of relationships among the labels. The first one concerns pairwise
positive entailement: pairs of labels, where the presence of one implies the
presence of the other in all instances of a dataset. The second concerns
exclusion: sets of labels that do not coexist in the same instances of the
dataset. These relationships are represented with a Bayesian network. Marginal
probabilities are entered as soft evidence in the network and adjusted through
probabilistic inference. Our approach offers robust improvements in mean
average precision compared to the standard binary relavance approach across all
12 datasets involved in our experiments. The discovery process helps
interesting implicit knowledge to emerge, which could be useful in itself."
"Ensemble classifier refers to a group of individual classifiers that are
cooperatively trained on data set in a supervised classification problem. In
this paper we present a review of commonly used ensemble classifiers in the
literature. Some ensemble classifiers are also developed targeting specific
applications. We also present some application driven ensemble classifiers in
this paper."
"Consider a Machine Learning Service Provider (MLSP) designed to rapidly
create highly accurate learners for a never-ending stream of new tasks. The
challenge is to produce task-specific learners that can be trained from few
labeled samples, even if tasks are not uniquely identified, and the number of
tasks and input dimensionality are large. In this paper, we argue that the MLSP
should exploit knowledge from previous tasks to build a good representation of
the environment it is in, and more precisely, that useful representations for
such a service are ones that minimize generalization error for a new hypothesis
trained on a new task. We formalize this intuition with a novel method that
minimizes an empirical proxy of the intra-task small-sample generalization
error. We present several empirical results showing state-of-the art
performance on single-task transfer, multitask learning, and the full lifelong
learning problem."
"Stochastic variational inference makes it possible to approximate posterior
distributions induced by large datasets quickly using stochastic optimization.
The algorithm relies on the use of fully factorized variational distributions.
However, this ""mean-field"" independence approximation limits the fidelity of
the posterior approximation, and introduces local optima. We show how to relax
the mean-field approximation to allow arbitrary dependencies between global
parameters and local hidden variables, producing better parameter estimates by
reducing bias, sensitivity to local optima, and sensitivity to hyperparameters."
"Dropout and other feature noising schemes have shown promising results in
controlling over-fitting by artificially corrupting the training data. Though
extensive theoretical and empirical studies have been performed for generalized
linear models, little work has been done for support vector machines (SVMs),
one of the most successful approaches for supervised learning. This paper
presents dropout training for linear SVMs. To deal with the intractable
expectation of the non-smooth hinge loss under corrupting distributions, we
develop an iteratively re-weighted least square (IRLS) algorithm by exploring
data augmentation techniques. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the
expectation of a re-weighted least square problem, where the re-weights have
closed-form solutions. The similar ideas are applied to develop a new IRLS
algorithm for the expected logistic loss under corrupting distributions. Our
algorithms offer insights on the connection and difference between the hinge
loss and logistic loss in dropout training. Empirical results on several real
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of dropout training on significantly
boosting the classification accuracy of linear SVMs."
"Machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict agent behaviors in
real-world dynamic systems, such as advertiser behaviors in sponsored search
and worker behaviors in crowdsourcing. The behavior data in these systems are
generated by live agents: once the systems change due to the adoption of the
prediction models learnt from the behavior data, agents will observe and
respond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. As a
result, the behavior data will evolve and will not be identically and
independently distributed, posing great challenges to the theoretical analysis
on the machine learning algorithms for behavior prediction. To tackle this
challenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments
(MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of
the machine learning algorithms on its basis. Since the one-step transition
probability matrix of MCRE depends on both previous states and the random
environment, conventional techniques for generalization analysis cannot be
directly applied. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique that
transforms the original MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov
chain. The new Markov chain involves more variables but is more regular, and
thus easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when
time approaches infinity. Then we prove a generalization bound for the machine
learning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain,
which depends on both the Markovian parameters and the covering number of the
function class compounded by the loss function for behavior prediction and the
behavior prediction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that performs the generalization analysis on data generated by complex
processes in real-world dynamic systems."
"Multi-target regression is concerned with the simultaneous prediction of
multiple continuous target variables based on the same set of input variables.
It arises in several interesting industrial and environmental application
domains, such as ecological modelling and energy forecasting. This paper
presents an ensemble method for multi-target regression that constructs new
target variables via random linear combinations of existing targets. We discuss
the connection of our approach with multi-label classification algorithms, in
particular RA$k$EL, which originally inspired this work, and a family of recent
multi-label classification algorithms that involve output coding. Experimental
results on 12 multi-target datasets show that it performs significantly better
than a strong baseline that learns a single model for each target using
gradient boosting and compares favourably to multi-objective random forest
approach, which is a state-of-the-art approach. The experiments further show
that our approach improves more when stronger unconditional dependencies exist
among the targets."
"Coactive learning is an online problem solving setting where the solutions
provided by a solver are interactively improved by a domain expert, which in
turn drives learning. In this paper we extend the study of coactive learning to
problems where obtaining a globally optimal or near-optimal solution may be
intractable or where an expert can only be expected to make small, local
improvements to a candidate solution. The goal of learning in this new setting
is to minimize the cost as measured by the expert effort over time. We first
establish theoretical bounds on the average cost of the existing coactive
Perceptron algorithm. In addition, we consider new online algorithms that use
cost-sensitive and Passive-Aggressive (PA) updates, showing similar or improved
theoretical bounds. We provide an empirical evaluation of the learners in
various domains, which show that the Perceptron based algorithms are quite
effective and that unlike the case for online classification, the PA algorithms
do not yield significant performance gains."
"Multi-view learning leverages correlations between different sources of data
to make predictions in one view based on observations in another view. A
popular approach is to assume that, both, the correlations between the views
and the view-specific covariances have a low-rank structure, leading to
inter-battery factor analysis, a model closely related to canonical correlation
analysis. We propose a convex relaxation of this model using structured norm
regularization. Further, we extend the convex formulation to a robust version
by adding an l1-penalized matrix to our estimator, similarly to convex robust
PCA. We develop and compare scalable algorithms for several convex multi-view
models. We show experimentally that the view-specific correlations are
improving data imputation performances, as well as labeling accuracy in
real-world multi-label prediction tasks."
"In this paper, we present a learning method for sequence labeling tasks in
which each example sequence has multiple label sequences. Our method learns
multiple models, one model for each label sequence. Each model computes the
joint probability of all label sequences given the example sequence. Although
each model considers all label sequences, its primary focus is only one label
sequence, and therefore, each model becomes a task-specific model, for the task
belonging to that primary label. Such multiple models are learned {\it
simultaneously} by facilitating the learning transfer among models through {\it
explicit parameter sharing}. We experiment the proposed method on two
applications and show that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art method."
"Using an optimization algorithm to solve a machine learning problem is one of
mainstreams in the field of science. In this work, we demonstrate a
comprehensive comparison of some state-of-the-art first-order optimization
algorithms for convex optimization problems in machine learning. We concentrate
on several smooth and non-smooth machine learning problems with a loss function
plus a regularizer. The overall experimental results show the superiority of
primal-dual algorithms in solving a machine learning problem from the
perspectives of the ease to construct, running time and accuracy."
"A new method to represent and approximate rotation matrices is introduced.
The method represents approximations of a rotation matrix $Q$ with linearithmic
complexity, i.e. with $\frac{1}{2}n\lg(n)$ rotations over pairs of coordinates,
arranged in an FFT-like fashion. The approximation is ""learned"" using gradient
descent. It allows to represent symmetric matrices $H$ as $QDQ^T$ where $D$ is
a diagonal matrix. It can be used to approximate covariance matrix of Gaussian
models in order to speed up inference, or to estimate and track the inverse
Hessian of an objective function by relating changes in parameters to changes
in gradient along the trajectory followed by the optimization procedure.
Experiments were conducted to approximate synthetic matrices, covariance
matrices of real data, and Hessian matrices of objective functions involved in
machine learning problems."
"In this paper, we propose to study four meteorological and seasonal time
series coupled with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modeling. We chose to
combine two transfer functions for the nodes of the hidden layer, and to use a
temporal indicator (time index as input) in order to take into account the
seasonal aspect of the studied time series. The results of the prediction
concern two years of measurements and the learning step, eight independent
years. We show that this methodology can improve the accuracy of meteorological
data estimation compared to a classical MLP modelling with a homogenous
transfer function."
"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used statistical models for modeling
sequential data. The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an
important learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation
are based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer
from high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence
of spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of
moments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade
and Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012
(arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic
data, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral
methods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method
applying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a
much more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the
algorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability
issues are encountered in this regime. In view of learning from real-world
experimental data, the representation of real-valued observations for the use
in spectral methods is discussed, presenting possible methods to represent data
for the use in the learning algorithms."
"We investigate how different learning restrictions reduce learning power and
how the different restrictions relate to one another. We give a complete map
for nine different restrictions both for the cases of complete information
learning and set-driven learning. This completes the picture for these
well-studied \emph{delayable} learning restrictions. A further insight is
gained by different characterizations of \emph{conservative} learning in terms
of variants of \emph{cautious} learning.
  Our analyses greatly benefit from general theorems we give, for example
showing that learners with exclusively delayable restrictions can always be
assumed total."
"In this paper, the Dempster-Shafer method is employed as the theoretical
basis for creating data classification systems. Testing is carried out using
three popular (multiple attribute) benchmark datasets that have two, three and
four classes. In each case, a subset of the available data is used for training
to establish thresholds, limits or likelihoods of class membership for each
attribute, and hence create mass functions that establish probability of class
membership for each attribute of the test data. Classification of each data
item is achieved by combination of these probabilities via Dempster's Rule of
Combination. Results for the first two datasets show extremely high
classification accuracy that is competitive with other popular methods. The
third dataset is non-numerical and difficult to classify, but good results can
be achieved provided the system and mass functions are designed carefully and
the right attributes are chosen for combination. In all cases the
Dempster-Shafer method provides comparable performance to other more popular
algorithms, but the overhead of generating accurate mass functions increases
the complexity with the addition of new attributes. Overall, the results
suggest that the D-S approach provides a suitable framework for the design of
classification systems and that automating the mass function design and
calculation would increase the viability of the algorithm for complex
classification problems."
"This paper presents a new solution for choosing the K parameter in the
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, the solution depending on the idea of
ensemble learning, in which a weak KNN classifier is used each time with a
different K, starting from one to the square root of the size of the training
set. The results of the weak classifiers are combined using the weighted sum
rule. The proposed solution was tested and compared to other solutions using a
group of experiments in real life problems. The experimental results show that
the proposed classifier outperforms the traditional KNN classifier that uses a
different number of neighbors, is competitive with other classifiers, and is a
promising classifier with strong potential for a wide range of applications."
"This paper presents a new similarity measure to be used for general tasks
including supervised learning, which is represented by the K-nearest neighbor
classifier (KNN). The proposed similarity measure is invariant to large
differences in some dimensions in the feature space. The proposed metric is
proved mathematically to be a metric. To test its viability for different
applications, the KNN used the proposed metric for classifying test examples
chosen from a number of real datasets. Compared to some other well known
metrics, the experimental results show that the proposed metric is a promising
distance measure for the KNN classifier with strong potential for a wide range
of applications."
"In this paper, we propose the problem of domain transfer structured output
learn- ing and the first solution to solve it. The problem is defined on two
different data domains sharing the same input and output spaces, named as
source domain and target domain. The outputs are structured, and for the data
samples of the source domain, the corresponding outputs are available, while
for most data samples of the target domain, the corresponding outputs are
missing. The input distributions of the two domains are significantly
different. The problem is to learn a predictor for the target domain to predict
the structured outputs from the input. Due to the limited number of outputs
available for the samples form the target domain, it is difficult to directly
learn the predictor from the target domain, thus it is necessary to use the
output information available in source domain. We propose to learn the target
domain predictor by adapting a auxiliary predictor trained by using source
domain data to the target domain. The adaptation is implemented by adding a
delta function on the basis of the auxiliary predictor. An algorithm is
developed to learn the parameter of the delta function to minimize loss
functions associat- ed with the predicted outputs against the true outputs of
the data samples with available outputs of the target domain."
"Much of the energy consumption in buildings is due to HVAC systems, which has
motivated several recent studies on making these systems more energy-
efficient. Occupancy and activity are two important aspects, which need to be
correctly estimated for optimal HVAC control. However, state-of-the-art methods
to estimate occupancy and classify activity require infrastructure and/or
wearable sensors which suffers from lower acceptability due to higher cost.
Encouragingly, with the advancement of the smartphones, these are becoming more
achievable. Most of the existing occupancy estimation tech- niques have the
underlying assumption that the phone is always carried by its user. However,
phones are often left at desk while attending meeting or other events, which
generates estimation error for the existing phone based occupancy algorithms.
Similarly, in the recent days the emerging theory of Sparse Random Classifier
(SRC) has been applied for activity classification on smartphone, however,
there are rooms to improve the on-phone process- ing. We propose a novel sensor
fusion method which offers almost 100% accuracy for occupancy estimation. We
also propose an activity classifica- tion algorithm, which offers similar
accuracy as of the state-of-the-art SRC algorithms while offering 50% reduction
in processing."
"The sensitivity of Adaboost to random label noise is a well-studied problem.
LogitBoost, BrownBoost and RobustBoost are boosting algorithms claimed to be
less sensitive to noise than AdaBoost. We present the results of experiments
evaluating these algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. We compare the
performance on each of datasets when the labels are corrupted by different
levels of independent label noise. In presence of random label noise, we found
that BrownBoost and RobustBoost perform significantly better than AdaBoost and
LogitBoost, while the difference between each pair of algorithms is
insignificant. We provide an explanation for the difference based on the margin
distributions of the algorithms."
"In this paper, we propose to learn a Mahalanobis distance to perform
alignment of multivariate time series. The learning examples for this task are
time series for which the true alignment is known. We cast the alignment
problem as a structured prediction task, and propose realistic losses between
alignments for which the optimization is tractable. We provide experiments on
real data in the audio to audio context, where we show that the learning of a
similarity measure leads to improvements in the performance of the alignment
task. We also propose to use this metric learning framework to perform feature
selection and, from basic audio features, build a combination of these with
better performance for the alignment."
"A particularly successful role for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is as a
tool for discovering useful relational features for subsequent use in a
predictive model. Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational
features rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery
of which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically,
there are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting
any existing features with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially
improve the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward
enough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the
space of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in
principle, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been
confined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we
address this computational difficulty by allowing features to be constructed in
a distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each
of which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and
then builds a (local) model. We then employ a consensus-based algorithm, in
which neighboring nodes share information to update local models. For a
category of models (those with convex loss functions), it can be shown that the
algorithm will result in all nodes converging to a consensus model. In
practice, it may be slow to achieve this convergence. Nevertheless, our results
on synthetic and real datasets that suggests that in relatively short time the
""best"" node in the network reaches a model whose predictive accuracy is
comparable to that obtained using more computational effort in a
non-distributed setting (the best node is identified as the one whose weights
converge first)."
"This work focuses on active learning of distance metrics from relative
comparison information. A relative comparison specifies, for a data point
triplet $(x_i,x_j,x_k)$, that instance $x_i$ is more similar to $x_j$ than to
$x_k$. Such constraints, when available, have been shown to be useful toward
defining appropriate distance metrics. In real-world applications, acquiring
constraints often require considerable human effort. This motivates us to study
how to select and query the most useful relative comparisons to achieve
effective metric learning with minimum user effort. Given an underlying class
concept that is employed by the user to provide such constraints, we present an
information-theoretic criterion that selects the triplet whose answer leads to
the highest expected gain in information about the classes of a set of
examples. Directly applying the proposed criterion requires examining $O(n^3)$
triplets with $n$ instances, which is prohibitive even for datasets of moderate
size. We show that a randomized selection strategy can be used to reduce the
selection pool from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$, allowing us to scale up to larger-size
problems. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
two baseline policies."
"We develop a novel probabilistic approach for multi-label classification that
is based on the mixtures-of-experts architecture combined with recently
introduced conditional tree-structured Bayesian networks. Our approach captures
different input-output relations from multi-label data using the efficient
tree-structured classifiers, while the mixtures-of-experts architecture aims to
compensate for the tree-structured restrictions and build a more accurate
model. We develop and present algorithms for learning the model from data and
for performing multi-label predictions on future data instances. Experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves highly
competitive results and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art multi-label
classification methods."
"With the availability of high precision digital sensors and cheap storage
medium, it is not uncommon to find large amounts of data collected on almost
all measurable attributes, both in nature and man-made habitats. Weather in
particular has been an area of keen interest for researchers to develop more
accurate and reliable prediction models. This paper presents a set of
experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to
build models to predict the day of the week given the weather data for that
particular day i.e. temperature, wind, rain etc., and test their reliability
across four cities in Australia {Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart}. The
results provide a comparison of accuracy of these machine learning techniques
and their reliability to predict the day of the week by analysing the weather
data. We then apply the models to predict weather conditions based on the
available data."
"We consider the approximation capability of orthogonal super greedy
algorithms (OSGA) and its applications in supervised learning. OSGA is
concerned with selecting more than one atoms in each iteration step, which, of
course, greatly reduces the computational burden when compared with the
conventional orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA). We prove that even for function
classes that are not the convex hull of the dictionary, OSGA does not degrade
the approximation capability of OGA provided the dictionary is incoherent.
Based on this, we deduce a tight generalization error bound for OSGA learning.
Our results show that in the realm of supervised learning, OSGA provides a
possibility to further reduce the computational burden of OGA in the premise of
maintaining its prominent generalization capability."
"We consider \textit{anytime} linear prediction in the common machine learning
setting, where features are in groups that have costs. We achieve anytime (or
interruptible) predictions by sequencing the computation of feature groups and
reporting results using the computed features at interruption. We extend
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Forward Regression (FR) to learn the
sequencing greedily under this group setting with costs. We theoretically
guarantee that our algorithms achieve near-optimal linear predictions at each
budget when a feature group is chosen. With a novel analysis of OMP, we improve
its theoretical bound to the same strength as that of FR. In addition, we
develop a novel algorithm that consumes cost $4B$ to approximate the optimal
performance of \textit{any} cost $B$, and prove that with cost less than $4B$,
such an approximation is impossible. To our knowledge, these are the first
anytime bounds at \textit{all} budgets. We test our algorithms on two
real-world data-sets and evaluate them in terms of anytime linear prediction
performance against cost-weighted Group Lasso and alternative greedy
algorithms."
"Subspace clustering (SC) is a promising clustering technology to identify
clusters based on their associations with subspaces in high dimensional spaces.
SC can be classified into hard subspace clustering (HSC) and soft subspace
clustering (SSC). While HSC algorithms have been extensively studied and well
accepted by the scientific community, SSC algorithms are relatively new but
gaining more attention in recent years due to better adaptability. In the
paper, a comprehensive survey on existing SSC algorithms and the recent
development are presented. The SSC algorithms are classified systematically
into three main categories, namely, conventional SSC (CSSC), independent SSC
(ISSC) and extended SSC (XSSC). The characteristics of these algorithms are
highlighted and the potential future development of SSC is also discussed."
"The traditional prototype based clustering methods, such as the well-known
fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm, usually need sufficient data to find a good
clustering partition. If the available data is limited or scarce, most of the
existing prototype based clustering algorithms will no longer be effective.
While the data for the current clustering task may be scarce, there is usually
some useful knowledge available in the related scenes/domains. In this study,
the concept of transfer learning is applied to prototype based fuzzy clustering
(PFC). Specifically, the idea of leveraging knowledge from the source domain is
exploited to develop a set of transfer prototype based fuzzy clustering (TPFC)
algorithms. Three prototype based fuzzy clustering algorithms, namely, FCM,
fuzzy k-plane clustering (FKPC) and fuzzy subspace clustering (FSC), have been
chosen to incorporate with knowledge leveraging mechanism to develop the
corresponding transfer clustering algorithms. Novel objective functions are
proposed to integrate the knowledge of source domain with the data of target
domain for clustering in the target domain. The proposed algorithms have been
validated on different synthetic and real-world datasets and the results
demonstrate their effectiveness when compared with both the original prototype
based fuzzy clustering algorithms and the related clustering algorithms like
multi-task clustering and co-clustering."
"This document discusses the Information Theoretically Efficient Model (ITEM),
a computerized system to generate an information theoretically efficient
multinomial logistic regression from a general dataset. More specifically, this
model is designed to succeed even where the logit transform of the dependent
variable is not necessarily linear in the independent variables. This research
shows that for large datasets, the resulting models can be produced on modern
computers in a tractable amount of time. These models are also resistant to
overfitting, and as such they tend to produce interpretable models with only a
limited number of features, all of which are designed to be well behaved."
"We study the best-arm identification problem in linear bandit, where the
rewards of the arms depend linearly on an unknown parameter $\theta^*$ and the
objective is to return the arm with the largest reward. We characterize the
complexity of the problem and introduce sample allocation strategies that pull
arms to identify the best arm with a fixed confidence, while minimizing the
sample budget. In particular, we show the importance of exploiting the global
linear structure to improve the estimate of the reward of near-optimal arms. We
analyze the proposed strategies and compare their empirical performance.
Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we point out the connection to the
$G$-optimality criterion used in optimal experimental design."
"By exploiting the duality between boosting and online learning, we present a
boosting framework which proves to be extremely powerful thanks to employing
the vast knowledge available in the online learning area. Using this framework,
we develop various algorithms to address multiple practically and theoretically
interesting questions including sparse boosting, smooth-distribution boosting,
agnostic learning and some generalization to double-projection online learning
algorithms, as a by-product."
"Feature subset selection, as a special case of the general subset selection
problem, has been the topic of a considerable number of studies due to the
growing importance of data-mining applications. In the feature subset selection
problem there are two main issues that need to be addressed: (i) Finding an
appropriate measure function than can be fairly fast and robustly computed for
high-dimensional data. (ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the
subset space in a reasonable amount of time. In this article mutual information
between features and class labels is considered to be the measure function. Two
series expansions for mutual information are proposed, and it is shown that
most heuristic criteria suggested in the literature are truncated
approximations of these expansions. It is well-known that searching the whole
subset space is an NP-hard problem. Here, instead of the conventional
sequential search algorithms, we suggest a parallel search strategy based on
semidefinite programming (SDP) that can search through the subset space in
polynomial time. By exploiting the similarities between the proposed algorithm
and an instance of the maximum-cut problem in graph theory, the approximation
ratio of this algorithm is derived and is compared with the approximation ratio
of the backward elimination method. The experiments show that it can be
misleading to judge the quality of a measure solely based on the classification
accuracy, without taking the effect of the non-optimum search strategy into
account."
"In this paper, a novel pattern classification approach is proposed by
regularizing the classifier learning to maximize mutual information between the
classification response and the true class label. We argue that, with the
learned classifier, the uncertainty of the true class label of a data sample
should be reduced by knowing its classification response as much as possible.
The reduced uncertainty is measured by the mutual information between the
classification response and the true class label. To this end, when learning a
linear classifier, we propose to maximize the mutual information between
classification responses and true class labels of training samples, besides
minimizing the classification error and reduc- ing the classifier complexity.
An objective function is constructed by modeling mutual information with
entropy estimation, and it is optimized by a gradi- ent descend method in an
iterative algorithm. Experiments on two real world pattern classification
problems show the significant improvements achieved by maximum mutual
information regularization."
"In cognitive radio (CR) technology, the trend of sensing is no longer to only
detect the presence of active primary users. A large number of applications
demand for more comprehensive knowledge on primary user behaviors in spatial,
temporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the
statistical relationship among primary users by introducing a Bayesian network
(BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing
issue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community.
Besides, another key problem in this learning scenario is that the CR has to
identify how many variables are in the BN, which is usually considered as prior
knowledge in statistical learning applications. To solve such two issues
simultaneously, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme consisting
of an efficient structure learning algorithm and a blind variable
identification scheme. The proposed approach incurs significantly lower
computational complexity compared with previous ones, and is capable of
determining the structure without assuming much prior knowledge about
variables. With this result, cognitive users could efficiently understand the
statistical pattern of primary networks, such that more efficient cognitive
protocols could be designed across different network layers."
"Kernel-based approaches for sequence classification have been successfully
applied to a variety of domains, including the text categorization, image
classification, speech analysis, biological sequence analysis, time series and
music classification, where they show some of the most accurate results.
  Typical kernel functions for sequences in these domains (e.g., bag-of-words,
mismatch, or subsequence kernels) are restricted to {\em discrete univariate}
(i.e. one-dimensional) string data, such as sequences of words in the text
analysis, codeword sequences in the image analysis, or nucleotide or amino acid
sequences in the DNA and protein sequence analysis. However, original sequence
data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and
discrete as required by typical $k$-mer based sequence kernel functions.
  In this work, we consider the problem of the {\em multivariate} sequence
classification such as classification of multivariate music sequences, or
multidimensional protein sequence representations. To this end, we extend {\em
univariate} kernel functions typically used in sequence analysis and propose
efficient {\em multivariate} similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a
direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence dimension in the original
{\em real-valued} multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate
discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence
representations to more accurately capture similarity relationships among
sequences and improve classification performance.
  Experiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent
classification performance on three challenging music classification tasks as
well as protein sequence classification with significant 25-40% improvements
over univariate kernel methods and existing state-of-the-art sequence
classification methods."
"For a classification problem described by the joint density $P(\omega,x)$,
models of $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have
been shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor
classification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties
of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can
reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\omega|x)$
given $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class
labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It
also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a
classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves
Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity
in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification
tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class
posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper
identifies a distinct class of classification problems using
$P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ to
solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution."
"Learning machines which have hierarchical structures or hidden variables are
singular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and their Fisher
information matrices are singular. In singular statistical models, neither the
Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the
maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main
reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances
from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes
generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error,
and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations
among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states
in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any
parametric model, and any a priori distribution. Also we show that Bayes and
Gibbs generalization errors are estimated by Bayes and Gibbs training errors,
and propose widely applicable information criteria which can be applied to both
regular and singular statistical models."
"We consider the problem of choosing a density estimate from a set of
distributions F, minimizing the L1-distance to an unknown distribution
(Devroye, Lugosi 2001). Devroye and Lugosi analyze two algorithms for the
problem: Scheffe tournament winner and minimum distance estimate. The Scheffe
tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance
estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.
  We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two
algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The
first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same
number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second
one, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear
number of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.
  We also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be
improved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation."
"Point clouds are sets of points in two or three dimensions. Most kernel
methods for learning on sets of points have not yet dealt with the specific
geometrical invariances and practical constraints associated with point clouds
in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we present extensions of graph
kernels for point clouds, which allow to use kernel methods for such ob jects
as shapes, line drawings, or any three-dimensional point clouds. In order to
design rich and numerically efficient kernels with as few free parameters as
possible, we use kernels between covariance matrices and their factorizations
on graphical models. We derive polynomial time dynamic programming recursions
and present applications to recognition of handwritten digits and Chinese
characters from few training examples."
"The enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last
decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum random walk (QRW) with the
problem of data clustering, and develop two clustering algorithms based on the
one dimensional QRW. Then, the probability distributions on the positions
induced by QRW in these algorithms are investigated, which also indicates the
possibility of obtaining better results. Consequently, the experimental results
have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and
efficiently, and the clustering algorithms are of fast rates of convergence.
Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of
the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
"We present a convex formulation of dictionary learning for sparse signal
decomposition. Convexity is obtained by replacing the usual explicit upper
bound on the dictionary size by a convex rank-reducing term similar to the
trace norm. In particular, our formulation introduces an explicit trade-off
between size and sparsity of the decomposition of rectangular matrices. Using a
large set of synthetic examples, we compare the estimation abilities of the
convex and non-convex approaches, showing that while the convex formulation has
a single local minimum, this may lead in some cases to performance which is
inferior to the local minima of the non-convex formulation."
"We introduce a simple and computationally trivial method for binary
classification based on the evaluation of potential functions. We demonstrate
that despite the conceptual and computational simplicity of the method its
performance can match or exceed that of standard Support Vector Machine
methods."
"We consider bandit problems involving a large (possibly infinite) collection
of arms, in which the expected reward of each arm is a linear function of an
$r$-dimensional random vector $\mathbf{Z} \in \mathbb{R}^r$, where $r \geq 2$.
The objective is to minimize the cumulative regret and Bayes risk. When the set
of arms corresponds to the unit sphere, we prove that the regret and Bayes risk
is of order $\Theta(r \sqrt{T})$, by establishing a lower bound for an
arbitrary policy, and showing that a matching upper bound is obtained through a
policy that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases. The
phase-based policy is also shown to be effective if the set of arms satisfies a
strong convexity condition. For the case of a general set of arms, we describe
a near-optimal policy whose regret and Bayes risk admit upper bounds of the
form $O(r \sqrt{T} \log^{3/2} T)$."
"We present a practical and statistically consistent scheme for actively
learning binary classifiers under general loss functions. Our algorithm uses
importance weighting to correct sampling bias, and by controlling the variance,
we are able to give rigorous label complexity bounds for the learning process.
Experiments on passively labeled data show that this approach reduces the label
complexity required to achieve good predictive performance on many learning
problems."
"Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose
scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers.
When the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels
given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme
case, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally
consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination,
and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We
define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of
globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by
distributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the
ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and
the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed
labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In
addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of
completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the
ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of
classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0)."

"A $p$-adic modification of the split-LBG classification method is presented
in which first clusterings and then cluster centers are computed which locally
minimise an energy function. The outcome for a fixed dataset is independent of
the prime number $p$ with finitely many exceptions. The methods are applied to
the construction of $p$-adic classifiers in the context of learning."
"This paper has been withdrawn due to an error found by Dana Angluin and Lev
Reyzin."
"We learn multiple hypotheses for related tasks under a latent hierarchical
relationship between tasks. We exploit the intuition that for domain
adaptation, we wish to share classifier structure, but for multitask learning,
we wish to share covariance structure. Our hierarchical model is seen to
subsume several previously proposed multitask learning models and performs well
on three distinct real-world data sets."
"We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering
problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching,
coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering
model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define
distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this
problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of
unobserved random variables (we call these ""reference types"") that are generic
across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating
over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo
techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors.
We present a simple--but general--parameterization of our model based on a
Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three
real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art
supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform
other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics."
"Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework
for density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost:
inference in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when
conjugate distributions are used. In the common case when one seeks only a
maximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search
algorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive MCMC and variational
techniques. When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by
search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that
using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large
data sets."
"In Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by
the huge amount of delivered rules. In this paper we propose a new approach to
prune and filter discovered rules. Using Domain Ontologies, we strengthen the
integration of user knowledge in the post-processing task. Furthermore, an
interactive and iterative framework is designed to assist the user along the
analyzing task. On the one hand, we represent user domain knowledge using a
Domain Ontology over database. On the other hand, a novel technique is
suggested to prune and to filter discovered rules. The proposed framework was
applied successfully over the client database provided by Nantes Habitat."
"Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation
of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately,
exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of
approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large
dataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the
variable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have
its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We
describe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by
deriving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP
approximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a
compact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we
show how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy. In particular, we
show that endowing each basis point with its own full covariance matrix
provides a significant increase in approximation power."
"In this paper we discuss the techniques involved in the design of the famous
statistical spam filters that include Naive Bayes, Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Bayes
Additive Regression Tree. We compare these techniques with each other in terms
of accuracy, recall, precision, etc. Further, we discuss the effectiveness and
limitations of statistical filters in filtering out various types of spam from
legitimate e-mails."
"We study the problem of online regression. We prove a theoretical bound on
the square loss of Ridge Regression. We do not make any assumptions about input
vectors or outcomes. We also show that Bayesian Ridge Regression can be thought
of as an online algorithm competing with all the Gaussian linear experts."
"We propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for
high dimensional data based on score functions derived from nearest neighbor
graphs on $n$-point nominal data. Anomalies are declared whenever the score of
a test sample falls below $\alpha$, which is supposed to be the desired false
alarm level. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically
optimal in that it is uniformly most powerful for the specified false alarm
level, $\alpha$, for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the
nominal and a known density. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, being
linear in dimension and quadratic in data size. It does not require choosing
complicated tuning parameters or function approximation classes and it can
adapt to local structure such as local change in dimensionality. We demonstrate
the algorithm on both artificial and real data sets in high dimensional feature
spaces."
"In this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing a hidden weighted
hypergraph of constant rank using additive queries. We prove the following: Let
$G$ be a weighted hidden hypergraph of constant rank with n vertices and $m$
hyperedges. For any $m$ there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the
edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\frac{m\log n}{\log m}) $$
additive queries. This solves the open problem in [S. Choi, J. H. Kim. Optimal
Query Complexity Bounds for Finding Graphs. {\em STOC}, 749--758,~2008].
  When the weights of the hypergraph are integers that are less than
$O(poly(n^d/m))$ where $d$ is the rank of the hypergraph (and therefore for
unweighted hypergraphs) there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the
edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\frac{m\log \frac{n^d}{m}}{\log
m}). $$ additive queries.
  Using the information theoretic bound the above query complexities are tight."
"Multi-class classification is one of the most important tasks in machine
learning. In this paper we consider two online multi-class classification
problems: classification by a linear model and by a kernelized model. The
quality of predictions is measured by the Brier loss function. We suggest two
computationally efficient algorithms to work with these problems and prove
theoretical guarantees on their losses. We kernelize one of the algorithms and
prove theoretical guarantees on its loss. We perform experiments and compare
our algorithms with logistic regression."
"Discovering latent representations of the observed world has become
increasingly more relevant in data analysis. Much of the effort concentrates on
building latent variables which can be used in prediction problems, such as
classification and regression. A related goal of learning latent structure from
data is that of identifying which hidden common causes generate the
observations, such as in applications that require predicting the effect of
policies. This will be the main problem tackled in our contribution: given a
dataset of indicators assumed to be generated by unknown and unmeasured common
causes, we wish to discover which hidden common causes are those, and how they
generate our data. This is possible under the assumption that observed
variables are linear functions of the latent causes with additive noise.
Previous results in the literature present solutions for the case where each
observed variable is a noisy function of a single latent variable. We show how
to extend the existing results for some cases where observed variables measure
more than one latent variable."
"Bayes statistics and statistical physics have the common mathematical
structure, where the log likelihood function corresponds to the random
Hamiltonian. Recently, it was discovered that the asymptotic learning curves in
Bayes estimation are subject to a universal law, even if the log likelihood
function can not be approximated by any quadratic form. However, it is left
unknown what mathematical property ensures such a universal law. In this paper,
we define a renormalizable condition of the statistical estimation problem, and
show that, under such a condition, the asymptotic learning curves are ensured
to be subject to the universal law, even if the true distribution is
unrealizable and singular for a statistical model. Also we study a
nonrenormalizable case, in which the learning curves have the different
asymptotic behaviors from the universal law."
"Associative Classifier is a novel technique which is the integration of
Association Rule Mining and Classification. The difficult task in building
Associative Classifier model is the selection of relevant rules from a large
number of class association rules (CARs). A very popular method of ordering
rules for selection is based on confidence, support and antecedent size (CSA).
Other methods are based on hybrid orderings in which CSA method is combined
with other measures. In the present work, we study the effect of using
different interestingness measures of Association rules in CAR rule ordering
and selection for associative classifier."
"This paper presents a framework aimed at monitoring the behavior of aircraft
in a given airspace. Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data
driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC)
to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the
runway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control
of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the
flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their
variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is
then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations
previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is
presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in
real time. The airspace is ""healthy"" when all aircraft are flying according to
the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the
conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does
not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to
ensure a safe separation between aircraft."
"This paper proposes a novel similarity measure for clustering sequential
data. We first construct a common state-space by training a single
probabilistic model with all the sequences in order to get a unified
representation for the dataset. Then, distances are obtained attending to the
transition matrices induced by each sequence in that state-space. This approach
solves some of the usual overfitting and scalability issues of the existing
semi-parametric techniques, that rely on training a model for each sequence.
Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the
advantages of the proposed similarity measure for clustering sequences."
"In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is
asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since
many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior
of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established
the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information
criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the
average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically
compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information
criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is
asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a
random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization
using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the
Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is
asymptotically equal to $2\lambda/n$, where $\lambda$ is the real log canonical
threshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation
between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined
by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify
that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes
cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion."
"We present a solution to the problem of understanding a system that produces
a sequence of temporally ordered observations. Our solution is based on
generating and interpreting a set of temporal decision rules. A temporal
decision rule is a decision rule that can be used to predict or retrodict the
value of a decision attribute, using condition attributes that are observed at
times other than the decision attribute's time of observation. A rule set,
consisting of a set of temporal decision rules with the same decision
attribute, can be interpreted by our Temporal Investigation Method for
Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS) to signify an instantaneous, an acausal
or a possibly causal relationship between the condition attributes and the
decision attribute. We show the effectiveness of our method, by describing a
number of experiments with both synthetic and real temporal data."
"In this work we investigate the relationship between Bregman distances and
regularized Logistic Regression model. We present a detailed study of Bregman
Distance minimization, a family of generalized entropy measures associated with
convex functions. We convert the L1-regularized logistic regression into this
more general framework and propose a primal-dual method based algorithm for
learning the parameters. We pose L1-regularized logistic regression into
Bregman distance minimization and then apply non-linear constrained
optimization techniques to estimate the parameters of the logistic model."
"We describe and analyze efficient algorithms for learning a linear predictor
from examples when the learner can only view a few attributes of each training
example. This is the case, for instance, in medical research, where each
patient participating in the experiment is only willing to go through a small
number of tests. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples
sufficient to compensate for the lack of full information on each training
example. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms by showing that when
running on digit recognition data, they obtain a high prediction accuracy even
when the learner gets to see only four pixels of each image."
"Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with
significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book
recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music
recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating
probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric
kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly
censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using
combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach
with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The
results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing
probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender
systems."
"We present a tutorial on Bayesian optimization, a method of finding the
maximum of expensive cost functions. Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian
technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with
evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of
the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into
account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and
exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best
observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization,
with experiments---active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical
reinforcement learning---and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian
optimization based on our experiences."
"In this paper, we propose a two-timescale delay-optimal dynamic clustering
and power allocation design for downlink network MIMO systems. The dynamic
clustering control is adaptive to the global queue state information (GQSI)
only and computed at the base station controller (BSC) over a longer time
scale. On the other hand, the power allocations of all the BSs in one cluster
are adaptive to both intra-cluster channel state information (CCSI) and
intra-cluster queue state information (CQSI), and computed at the cluster
manager (CM) over a shorter time scale. We show that the two-timescale
delay-optimal control can be formulated as an infinite-horizon average cost
Constrained Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (CPOMDP). By exploiting
the special problem structure, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman equation
in terms of Pattern Selection Q-factor to solve the CPOMDP. To address the
distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory requirement and
computational complexity, we approximate the Pattern Selection Q-factor by the
sum of Per-cluster Potential functions and propose a novel distributive online
learning algorithm to estimate the Per-cluster Potential functions (at each CM)
as well as the Lagrange multipliers (LM) (at each BS). We show that the
proposed distributive online learning algorithm converges almost surely (with
probability 1). By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics,
we further decompose the Per-cluster Potential function into sum of Per-cluster
Per-user Potential functions and formulate the instantaneous power allocation
as a Per-stage QSI-aware Interference Game played among all the CMs. We also
propose a QSI-aware Simultaneous Iterative Water-filling Algorithm (QSIWFA) and
show that it can achieve the Nash Equilibrium (NE)."
"To attain the best learning accuracy, people move on with difficulties and
frustrations. Though one can optimize the empirical objective using a given set
of samples, its generalization ability to the entire sample distribution
remains questionable. Even if a fair generalization guarantee is offered, one
still wants to know what is to happen if the regularizer is removed, and/or how
well the artificial loss (like the hinge loss) relates to the accuracy.
  For such reason, this report surveys four different trials towards the
learning accuracy, embracing the major advances in supervised learning theory
in the past four years. Starting from the generic setting of learning, the
first two trials introduce the best optimization and generalization bounds for
convex learning, and the third trial gets rid of the regularizer. As an
innovative attempt, the fourth trial studies the optimization when the
objective is exactly the accuracy, in the special case of binary
classification. This report also analyzes the last trial through experiments."
"This report explores the use of machine learning techniques to accurately
predict travel times in city streets and highways using floating car data
(location information of user vehicles on a road network). The aim of this
report is twofold, first we present a general architecture of solving this
problem, then present and evaluate few techniques on real floating car data
gathered over a month on a 5 Km highway in New Delhi."
"This article discusses in detail the rating system that won the kaggle
competition ""Chess Ratings: Elo vs the rest of the world"". The competition
provided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to
discover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games,
more accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating
system, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating
system. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the
outcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of
the players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that
avoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is
relatively small and one has to be careful not to draw ""too many conclusions""
out of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs
of such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a
very good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the
private hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the
number of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the
opponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for
training the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage
and regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation."
"We consider the problem of learning an unknown product distribution $X$ over
$\{0,1\}^n$ using samples $f(X)$ where $f$ is a \emph{known} transformation
function. Each choice of a transformation function $f$ specifies a learning
problem in this framework.
  Information-theoretic arguments show that for every transformation function
$f$ the corresponding learning problem can be solved to accuracy $\eps$, using
$\tilde{O}(n/\eps^2)$ examples, by a generic algorithm whose running time may
be exponential in $n.$ We show that this learning problem can be
computationally intractable even for constant $\eps$ and rather simple
transformation functions. Moreover, the above sample complexity bound is nearly
optimal for the general problem, as we give a simple explicit linear
transformation function $f(x)=w \cdot x$ with integer weights $w_i \leq n$ and
prove that the corresponding learning problem requires $\Omega(n)$ samples.
  As our main positive result we give a highly efficient algorithm for learning
a sum of independent unknown Bernoulli random variables, corresponding to the
transformation function $f(x)= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. Our algorithm learns to
$\eps$-accuracy in poly$(n)$ time, using a surprising poly$(1/\eps)$ number of
samples that is independent of $n.$ We also give an efficient algorithm that
uses $\log n \cdot \poly(1/\eps)$ samples but has running time that is only
$\poly(\log n, 1/\eps).$"
"Feature selection with specific multivariate performance measures is the key
to the success of many applications, such as image retrieval and text
classification. The existing feature selection methods are usually designed for
classification error. In this paper, we propose a generalized sparse
regularizer. Based on the proposed regularizer, we present a unified feature
selection framework for general loss functions. In particular, we study the
novel feature selection paradigm by optimizing multivariate performance
measures. The resultant formulation is a challenging problem for
high-dimensional data. Hence, a two-layer cutting plane algorithm is proposed
to solve this problem, and the convergence is presented. In addition, we adapt
the proposed method to optimize multivariate measures for multiple instance
learning problems. The analyses by comparing with the state-of-the-art feature
selection methods show that the proposed method is superior to others.
Extensive experiments on large-scale and high-dimensional real world datasets
show that the proposed method outperforms $l_1$-SVM and SVM-RFE when choosing a
small subset of features, and achieves significantly improved performances over
SVM$^{perf}$ in terms of $F_1$-score."
"In this work we study parallelization of online learning, a core primitive in
machine learning. In a parallel environment all known approaches for parallel
online learning lead to delayed updates, where the model is updated using
out-of-date information. In the worst case, or when examples are temporally
correlated, delay can have a very adverse effect on the learning algorithm.
Here, we analyze and present preliminary empirical results on a set of learning
architectures based on a feature sharding approach that present various
tradeoffs between delay, degree of parallelism, representation power and
empirical performance."
"We consider a suboptimal solution path algorithm for the Support Vector
Machine. The solution path algorithm is an effective tool for solving a
sequence of a parametrized optimization problems in machine learning. The path
of the solutions provided by this algorithm are very accurate and they satisfy
the optimality conditions more strictly than other SVM optimization algorithms.
In many machine learning application, however, this strict optimality is often
unnecessary, and it adversely affects the computational efficiency. Our
algorithm can generate the path of suboptimal solutions within an arbitrary
user-specified tolerance level. It allows us to control the trade-off between
the accuracy of the solution and the computational cost. Moreover, We also show
that our suboptimal solutions can be interpreted as the solution of a
\emph{perturbed optimization problem} from the original one. We provide some
theoretical analyses of our algorithm based on this novel interpretation. The
experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."
"We study the prevalent problem when a test distribution differs from the
training distribution. We consider a setting where our training set consists of
a small number of sample domains, but where we have many samples in each
domain. Our goal is to generalize to a new domain. For example, we may want to
learn a similarity function using only certain classes of objects, but we
desire that this similarity function be applicable to object classes not
present in our training sample (e.g. we might seek to learn that ""dogs are
similar to dogs"" even though images of dogs were absent from our training set).
Our theoretical analysis shows that we can select many more features than
domains while avoiding overfitting by utilizing data-dependent variance
properties. We present a greedy feature selection algorithm based on using
T-statistics. Our experiments validate this theory showing that our T-statistic
based greedy feature selection is more robust at avoiding overfitting than the
classical greedy procedure."
"We introduce an algorithm that, given n objects, learns a similarity matrix
over all n^2 pairs, from crowdsourced data alone. The algorithm samples
responses to adaptively chosen triplet-based relative-similarity queries. Each
query has the form ""is object 'a' more similar to 'b' or to 'c'?"" and is chosen
to be maximally informative given the preceding responses. The output is an
embedding of the objects into Euclidean space (like MDS); we refer to this as
the ""crowd kernel."" SVMs reveal that the crowd kernel captures prominent and
subtle features across a number of domains, such as ""is striped"" among neckties
and ""vowel vs. consonant"" among letters."
"In this short note we prove a maximal concentration lemma for sub-Gaussian

"We provide a natural learning process in which a financial trader without a
risk receives a gain in case when Stock Market is inefficient. In this process,
the trader rationally choose his gambles using a prediction made by a
randomized calibrated algorithm. Our strategy is based on Dawid's notion of
calibration with more general changing checking rules and on some modification
of Kakade and Foster's randomized algorithm for computing calibrated forecasts."
"We begin this report by describing the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)
model for learning a concept class, consisting of subsets of a domain, and a
function class, consisting of functions from the domain to the unit interval.
Two combinatorial parameters, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and its
generalization, the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e, are explained and a
few examples of their calculations are given with proofs. We then explain
Sauer's Lemma, which involves the VC dimension and is used to prove the
equivalence of a concept class being distribution-free PAC learnable and it
having finite VC dimension.
  As the main new result of our research, we explore the construction of a new
function class, obtained by forming compositions with a continuous logic
connective, a uniformly continuous function from the unit hypercube to the unit
interval, from a collection of function classes. Vidyasagar had proved that
such a composition function class has finite Fat Shattering dimension of all
scales if the classes in the original collection do; however, no estimates of
the dimension were known. Using results by Mendelson-Vershynin and Talagrand,
we bound the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e of this new function class in
terms of the Fat Shattering dimensions of the collection's classes.
  We conclude this report by providing a few open questions and future research
topics involving the PAC learning model."
"In batch learning, stability together with existence and uniqueness of the
solution corresponds to well-posedness of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)
methods; recently, it was proved that CV_loo stability is necessary and
sufficient for generalization and consistency of ERM. In this note, we
introduce CV_on stability, which plays a similar note in online learning. We
show that stochastic gradient descent (SDG) with the usual hypotheses is CVon
stable and we then discuss the implications of CV_on stability for convergence
of SGD."
"Music prediction tasks range from predicting tags given a song or clip of
audio, predicting the name of the artist, or predicting related songs given a
song, clip, artist name or tag. That is, we are interested in every semantic
relationship between the different musical concepts in our database. In
realistically sized databases, the number of songs is measured in the hundreds
of thousands or more, and the number of artists in the tens of thousands or
more, providing a considerable challenge to standard machine learning
techniques. In this work, we propose a method that scales to such datasets
which attempts to capture the semantic similarities between the database items
by modeling audio, artist names, and tags in a single low-dimensional semantic
space. This choice of space is learnt by optimizing the set of prediction tasks
of interest jointly using multi-task learning. Our method both outperforms
baseline methods and, in comparison to them, is faster and consumes less
memory. We then demonstrate how our method learns an interpretable model, where
the semantic space captures well the similarities of interest."
"We propose a nonparametric generalization of belief propagation, Kernel
Belief Propagation (KBP), for pairwise Markov random fields. Messages are
represented as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and
message updates are simple linear operations in the RKHS. KBP makes none of the
assumptions commonly required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need
not arise from a finite domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their
relations take any particular parametric form. Rather, the relations between
variables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from
training data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where
kernels are defined (Rd, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric
models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not
exist. The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the
training data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update
procedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In
experiments, we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still
images, and protein configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing
classical and nonparametric approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases),
while providing significantly more accurate results."
"The classical perceptron rule provides a varying upper bound on the maximum
margin, namely the length of the current weight vector divided by the total
number of updates up to that time. Requiring that the perceptron updates its
internal state whenever the normalized margin of a pattern is found not to
exceed a certain fraction of this dynamic upper bound we construct a new
approximate maximum margin classifier called the perceptron with dynamic margin
(PDM). We demonstrate that PDM converges in a finite number of steps and derive
an upper bound on them. We also compare experimentally PDM with other
perceptron-like algorithms and support vector machines on hard margin tasks
involving linear kernels which are equivalent to 2-norm soft margin."
"Machine Learning (ML) techniques are indispensable in a wide range of fields.
Unfortunately, the exponential increase of dataset sizes are rapidly extending
the runtime of sequential algorithms and threatening to slow future progress in
ML. With the promise of affordable large-scale parallel computing, Cloud
systems offer a viable platform to resolve the computational challenges in ML.
However, designing and implementing efficient, provably correct distributed ML
algorithms is often prohibitively challenging. To enable ML researchers to
easily and efficiently use parallel systems, we introduced the GraphLab
abstraction which is designed to represent the computational patterns in ML
algorithms while permitting efficient parallel and distributed implementations.
In this paper we provide a formal description of the GraphLab parallel
abstraction and present an efficient distributed implementation. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of GraphLab on three state-of-the-art ML algorithms
using real large-scale data and a 64 node EC2 cluster of 512 processors. We
find that GraphLab achieves orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop
while performing comparably or superior to hand-tuned MPI implementations."
"For large scale learning problems, it is desirable if we can obtain the
optimal model parameters by going through the data in only one pass. Polyak and
Juditsky (1992) showed that asymptotically the test performance of the simple
average of the parameters obtained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is as
good as that of the parameters which minimize the empirical cost. However, to
our knowledge, despite its optimal asymptotic convergence rate, averaged SGD
(ASGD) received little attention in recent research on large scale learning.
One possible reason is that it may take a prohibitively large number of
training samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for most real
problems. In this paper, we present a finite sample analysis for the method of
Polyak and Juditsky (1992). Our analysis shows that it indeed usually takes a
huge number of samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for improperly
chosen learning rate. More importantly, based on our analysis, we propose a
simple way to properly set learning rate so that it takes a reasonable amount
of data for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region. We compare ASGD using our
proposed learning rate with other well known algorithms for training large
scale linear classifiers. The experiments clearly show the superiority of ASGD."
"Discovering pattern sets or global patterns is an attractive issue from the
pattern mining community in order to provide useful information. By combining
local patterns satisfying a joint meaning, this approach produces patterns of
higher level and thus more useful for the data analyst than the usual local
patterns, while reducing the number of patterns. In parallel, recent works
investigating relationships between data mining and constraint programming (CP)
show that the CP paradigm is a nice framework to model and mine such patterns
in a declarative and generic way. We present a constraint-based language which
enables us to define queries addressing patterns sets and global patterns. The
usefulness of such a declarative approach is highlighted by several examples
coming from the clustering based on associations. This language has been
implemented in the CP framework."
"We show that for a general class of convex online learning problems, Mirror
Descent can always achieve a (nearly) optimal regret guarantee."
"This paper gives specific divergence examples of value-iteration for several
major Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms, when
using a function approximator for the value function. These divergence examples
differ from previous divergence examples in the literature, in that they are
applicable for a greedy policy, i.e. in a ""value iteration"" scenario. Perhaps
surprisingly, with a greedy policy, it is also possible to get divergence for
the algorithms TD(1) and Sarsa(1). In addition to these divergences, we also
achieve divergence for the Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms HDP, DHP and
GDHP."
"We provide a formal, simple and intuitive theory of rational decision making
including sequential decisions that affect the environment. The theory has a
geometric flavor, which makes the arguments easy to visualize and understand.
Our theory is for complete decision makers, which means that they have a
complete set of preferences. Our main result shows that a complete rational
decision maker implicitly has a probabilistic model of the environment. We have
a countable version of this result that brings light on the issue of countable
vs finite additivity by showing how it depends on the geometry of the space
which we have preferences over. This is achieved through fruitfully connecting
rationality with the Hahn-Banach Theorem. The theory presented here can be
viewed as a formalization and extension of the betting odds approach to
probability of Ramsey and De Finetti."
"Building biological models by inferring functional dependencies from
experimental data is an im- portant issue in Molecular Biology. To relieve the
biologist from this traditionally manual process, various approaches have been
proposed to increase the degree of automation. However, available ap- proaches
often yield a single model only, rely on specific assumptions, and/or use
dedicated, heuris- tic algorithms that are intolerant to changing circumstances
or requirements in the view of the rapid progress made in Biotechnology. Our
aim is to provide a declarative solution to the problem by ap- peal to Answer
Set Programming (ASP) overcoming these difficulties. We build upon an existing
approach to Automatic Network Reconstruction proposed by part of the authors.
This approach has firm mathematical foundations and is well suited for ASP due
to its combinatorial flavor providing a characterization of all models
explaining a set of experiments. The usage of ASP has several ben- efits over
the existing heuristic algorithms. First, it is declarative and thus
transparent for biological experts. Second, it is elaboration tolerant and thus
allows for an easy exploration and incorporation of biological constraints.
Third, it allows for exploring the entire space of possible models. Finally,
our approach offers an excellent performance, matching existing,
special-purpose systems."
"Structured classification tasks such as sequence labeling and dependency
parsing have seen much interest by the Natural Language Processing and the
machine learning communities. Several online learning algorithms were adapted
for structured tasks such as Perceptron, Passive- Aggressive and the recently
introduced Confidence-Weighted learning . These online algorithms are easy to
implement, fast to train and yield state-of-the-art performance. However,
unlike probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Model and Conditional random
fields, these methods generate models that output merely a prediction with no
additional information regarding confidence in the correctness of the output.
In this work we fill the gap proposing few alternatives to compute the
confidence in the output of non-probabilistic algorithms.We show how to compute
confidence estimates in the prediction such that the confidence reflects the
probability that the word is labeled correctly. We then show how to use our
methods to detect mislabeled words, trade recall for precision and active
learning. We evaluate our methods on four noun-phrase chunking and named entity
recognition sequence labeling tasks, and on dependency parsing for 14
languages."
"In this paper we propose and study a generalization of the standard
active-learning model where a more general type of query, class conditional
query, is allowed. Such queries have been quite useful in applications, but
have been lacking theoretical understanding. In this work, we characterize the
power of such queries under two well-known noise models. We give nearly tight
upper and lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn both for the
general agnostic setting and for the bounded noise model. We further show that
our methods can be made adaptive to the (unknown) noise rate, with only
negligible loss in query complexity."
"In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-armed bandits with a large,
possibly infinite number of correlated arms. We assume that the arms have
Bernoulli distributed rewards, independent across time, where the probabilities
of success are parametrized by known attribute vectors for each arm, as well as
an unknown preference vector, each of dimension $n$. For this model, we seek an
algorithm with a total regret that is sub-linear in time and independent of the
number of arms. We present such an algorithm, which we call the Two-Phase
Algorithm, and analyze its performance. We show upper bounds on the total
regret which applies uniformly in time, for both the finite and infinite arm
cases. The asymptotics of the finite arm bound show that for any $f \in
\omega(\log(T))$, the total regret can be made to be $O(n \cdot f(T))$. In the
infinite arm case, the total regret is $O(\sqrt{n^3 T})$."
"We present a framework for performing efficient regression in general metric
spaces. Roughly speaking, our regressor predicts the value at a new point by
computing a Lipschitz extension --- the smoothest function consistent with the
observed data --- after performing structural risk minimization to avoid
overfitting. We obtain finite-sample risk bounds with minimal structural and
noise assumptions, and a natural speed-precision tradeoff. The offline
(learning) and online (prediction) stages can be solved by convex programming,
but this naive approach has runtime complexity $O(n^3)$, which is prohibitive
for large datasets. We design instead a regression algorithm whose speed and
generalization performance depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data, to
which the algorithm adapts. While our main innovation is algorithmic, the
statistical results may also be of independent interest."
"Spectral clustering is a novel clustering method which can detect complex
shapes of data clusters. However, it requires the eigen decomposition of the
graph Laplacian matrix, which is proportion to $O(n^3)$ and thus is not
suitable for large scale systems. Recently, many methods have been proposed to
accelerate the computational time of spectral clustering. These approximate
methods usually involve sampling techniques by which a lot information of the
original data may be lost. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate
spectral clustering approach using an approximate commute time embedding, which
is similar to the spectral embedding. The method does not require using any
sampling technique and computing any eigenvector at all. Instead it uses random
projection and a linear time solver to find the approximate embedding. The
experiments in several synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed
approach has better clustering quality and is faster than the state-of-the-art
approximate spectral clustering methods."
"In this paper we propose a framework for solving constrained online convex
optimization problem. Our motivation stems from the observation that most
algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto
the convex set $\mathcal{K}$ from which the decisions are made. While for
simple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for
arbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be
inefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online
convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to
$\mathcal{K}$ for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define
the set $\mathcal{K}$ be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework
can be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side
constraints addressed in \cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and
\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}. By turning the problem into an online
convex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which
achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ bound for the violation of constraints. Then we
modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied
in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on
the Mirror Prox method \citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational
inequalities which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for
both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\K$ can be
described by a finite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the
result to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set
$\mathcal{K}$ and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same
bounds in expectation as our first algorithm."
"In citep{Hazan-2008-extract}, the authors showed that the regret of online
linear optimization can be bounded by the total variation of the cost vectors.
In this paper, we extend this result to general online convex optimization. We
first analyze the limitations of the algorithm in \citep{Hazan-2008-extract}
when applied it to online convex optimization. We then present two algorithms
for online convex optimization whose regrets are bounded by the variation of
cost functions. We finally consider the bandit setting, and present a
randomized algorithm for online bandit convex optimization with a
variation-based regret bound. We show that the regret bound for online bandit
convex optimization is optimal when the variation of cost functions is
independent of the number of trials."
"Contextual bandit learning is a reinforcement learning problem where the
learner repeatedly receives a set of features (context), takes an action and
receives a reward based on the action and context. We consider this problem
under a realizability assumption: there exists a function in a (known) function
class, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and
context. Under this assumption, we show three things. We present a new
algorithm---Regressor Elimination--- with a regret similar to the agnostic
setting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower
bound showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case
even with the realizability assumption. However, we do show that for any set of
policies (mapping contexts to actions), there is a distribution over rewards
(given context) such that our new algorithm has constant regret unlike the
previous approaches."
"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) addresses the problem of recovering a
task description given a demonstration of the optimal policy used to solve such
a task. The optimal policy is usually provided by an expert or teacher, making
IRL specially suitable for the problem of apprenticeship learning. The task
description is encoded in the form of a reward function of a Markov decision
process (MDP). Several algorithms have been proposed to find the reward
function corresponding to a set of demonstrations. One of the algorithms that
has provided best results in different applications is a gradient method to
optimize a policy squared error criterion. On a parallel line of research,
other authors have presented recently a gradient approximation of the maximum
likelihood estimate of the reward signal. In general, both approaches
approximate the gradient estimate and the criteria at different stages to make
the algorithm tractable and efficient. In this work, we provide a detailed
description of the different methods to highlight differences in terms of
reward estimation, policy similarity and computational costs. We also provide
experimental results to evaluate the differences in performance of the methods."
"We study upper and lower bounds on the sample-complexity of learning
near-optimal behaviour in finite-state discounted Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). For the upper bound we make the assumption that each action leads to at
most two possible next-states and prove a new bound for a UCRL-style algorithm
on the number of time-steps when it is not Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC). The new lower bound strengthens previous work by being both more general
(it applies to all policies) and tighter. The upper and lower bounds match up
to logarithmic factors."
"In this paper, we provide new theoretical results on the generalization
properties of learning algorithms for multiclass classification problems. The
originality of our work is that we propose to use the confusion matrix of a
classifier as a measure of its quality; our contribution is in the line of work
which attempts to set up and study the statistical properties of new evaluation
measures such as, e.g. ROC curves. In the confusion-based learning framework we
propose, we claim that a targetted objective is to minimize the size of the
confusion matrix C, measured through its operator norm ||C||. We derive
generalization bounds on the (size of the) confusion matrix in an extended
framework of uniform stability, adapted to the case of matrix valued loss.
Pivotal to our study is a very recent matrix concentration inequality that
generalizes McDiarmid's inequality. As an illustration of the relevance of our
theoretical results, we show how two SVM learning procedures can be proved to
be confusion-friendly. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the
first that focuses on the confusion matrix from a theoretical point of view."
"We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial
information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and
relies on upper-confidence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We
analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can
be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear
models. We show O(T^{1/2} log T) regret bounds, which improve in several ways
on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-confidence
scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world
multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance."
"Semi-supervised template update systems allow to automatically take into
account the intra-class variability of the biometric data over time. Such
systems can be inefficient by including too many impostor's samples or skipping
too many genuine's samples. In the first case, the biometric reference drifts
from the real biometric data and attracts more often impostors. In the second
case, the biometric reference does not evolve quickly enough and also
progressively drifts from the real biometric data. We propose a hybrid system
using several biometric sub-references in order to increase per- formance of
self-update systems by reducing the previously cited errors. The proposition is
validated for a keystroke- dynamics authentication system (this modality
suffers of high variability over time) on two consequent datasets from the
state of the art."
"Most keystroke dynamics studies have been evaluated using a specific kind of
dataset in which users type an imposed login and password. Moreover, these
studies are optimistics since most of them use different acquisition protocols,
private datasets, controlled environment, etc. In order to enhance the accuracy
of keystroke dynamics' performance, the main contribution of this paper is
twofold. First, we provide a new kind of dataset in which users have typed both
an imposed and a chosen pairs of logins and passwords. In addition, the
keystroke dynamics samples are collected in a web-based uncontrolled
environment (OS, keyboards, browser, etc.). Such kind of dataset is important
since it provides us more realistic results of keystroke dynamics' performance
in comparison to the literature (controlled environment, etc.). Second, we
present a statistical analysis of well known assertions such as the
relationship between performance and password size, impact of fusion schemes on
system overall performance, and others such as the relationship between
performance and entropy. We put into obviousness in this paper some new results
on keystroke dynamics in realistic conditions."
"The selection of the best classification algorithm for a given dataset is a
very widespread problem. It is also a complex one, in the sense it requires to
make several important methodological choices. Among them, in this work we
focus on the measure used to assess the classification performance and rank the
algorithms. We present the most popular measures and discuss their properties.
Despite the numerous measures proposed over the years, many of them turn out to
be equivalent in this specific case, to have interpretation problems, or to be
unsuitable for our purpose. Consequently, classic overall success rate or
marginal rates should be preferred for this specific task."
"It has previously been hypothesized, and supported with some experimental
evidence, that deeper representations, when well trained, tend to do a better
job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. We study the
following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better
disentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains.
Consequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of
representation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose
a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space
they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at
higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them
experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing and
interpolating between samples."
"Electronic health records contain rich textual data which possess critical
predictive information for machine-learning based diagnostic aids. However many
traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate both
vector space data and text. We present a supervised method using Laplacian
eigenmaps to augment existing machine-learning methods with low-dimensional
representations of textual predictors which preserve the local similarities.
The proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient
descent. For the evaluation we applied our method to over 2,000 patient records
from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients
were diagnosed with cardiac disease. Our method was compared with latent
semantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant
analysis. The results were assessed using AUC, MCC, specificity, and
sensitivity. Results indicate supervised Laplacian eigenmaps was the highest
performing method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC
respectively. SLE showed an increase in 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the
baseline which excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and
MCC respectively over unsupervised Laplacian eigenmaps. This method allows many
existing machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently utilize the
potential of textual predictors."
"The k-means algorithm is one of the well-known and most popular clustering
algorithms. K-means seeks an optimal partition of the data by minimizing the
sum of squared error with an iterative optimization procedure, which belongs to
the category of hill climbing algorithms. As we know hill climbing searches are
famous for converging to local optimums. Since k-means can converge to a local
optimum, different initial points generally lead to different convergence
cancroids, which makes it important to start with a reasonable initial
partition in order to achieve high quality clustering solutions. However, in
theory, there exist no efficient and universal methods for determining such
initial partitions. In this paper we tried to find an optimum initial
partitioning for k-means algorithm. To achieve this goal we proposed a new
improved version of downhill simplex search, and then we used it in order to
find an optimal result for clustering approach and then compare this algorithm
with Genetic Algorithm base (GA), Genetic K-Means (GKM), Improved Genetic
K-Means (IGKM) and k-means algorithms."
"Feature selection is one of the most prominent learning tasks, especially in
high-dimensional datasets in which the goal is to understand the mechanisms
that underly the learning dataset. However most of them typically deliver just
a flat set of relevant features and provide no further information on what kind
of structures, e.g. feature groupings, might underly the set of relevant
features. In this paper we propose a new learning paradigm in which our goal is
to uncover the structures that underly the set of relevant features for a given
learning problem. We uncover two types of features sets, non-replaceable
features that contain important information about the target variable and
cannot be replaced by other features, and functionally similar features sets
that can be used interchangeably in learned models, given the presence of the
non-replaceable features, with no change in the predictive performance. To do
so we propose a new learning algorithm that learns a number of disjoint models
using a model disjointness regularization constraint together with a constraint
on the predictive agreement of the disjoint models. We explore the behavior of
our approach on a number of high-dimensional datasets, and show that, as
expected by their construction, these satisfy a number of properties. Namely,
model disjointness, a high predictive agreement, and a similar predictive
performance to models learned on the full set of relevant features. The ability
to structure the set of relevant features in such a manner can become a
valuable tool in different applications of scientific knowledge discovery."
"Cost-sensitive learning relies on the availability of a known and fixed cost
matrix. However, in some scenarios, the cost matrix is uncertain during
training, and re-train a classifier after the cost matrix is specified would
not be an option. For binary classification, this issue can be successfully
addressed by methods maximizing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.
Since the AUC can measure performance of base classifiers independent of cost
during training, and a larger AUC is more likely to lead to a smaller total
cost in testing using the threshold moving method. As an extension of AUC to
multi-class problems, MAUC has attracted lots of attentions and been widely
used. Although MAUC also measures performance of base classifiers independent
of cost, it is unclear whether a larger MAUC of classifiers is more likely to
lead to a smaller total cost. In fact, it is also unclear what kinds of
post-processing methods should be used in multi-class problems to convert base
classifiers into discrete classifiers such that the total cost is as small as
possible. In the paper, we empirically explore the relationship between MAUC
and the total cost of classifiers by applying two categories of post-processing
methods. Our results suggest that a larger MAUC is also beneficial.
Interestingly, simple calibration methods that convert the output matrix into
posterior probabilities perform better than existing sophisticated post
re-optimization methods."
"In this paper, naive Bayesian and C4.5 Decision Tree Classifiers(DTC) are
successively applied on materials informatics to classify the engineering
materials into different classes for the selection of materials that suit the
input design specifications. Here, the classifiers are analyzed individually
and their performance evaluation is analyzed with confusion matrix predictive
parameters and standard measures, the classification results are analyzed on
different class of materials. Comparison of classifiers has found that naive
Bayesian classifier is more accurate and better than the C4.5 DTC. The
knowledge discovered by the naive bayesian classifier can be employed for
decision making in materials selection in manufacturing industries."
"Conformal predictors are set predictors that are automatically valid in the
sense of having coverage probability equal to or exceeding a given confidence
level. Inductive conformal predictors are a computationally efficient version
of conformal predictors satisfying the same property of validity. However,
inductive conformal predictors have been only known to control unconditional
coverage probability. This paper explores various versions of conditional
validity and various ways to achieve them using inductive conformal predictors
and their modifications."
"This paper investigates energy efficiency for two-tier femtocell networks
through combining game theory and stochastic learning. With the Stackelberg
game formulation, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework is applied to
study the joint average utility maximization of macrocells and femtocells
subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements.
The macrocells behave as the leaders and the femtocells are followers during
the learning procedure. At each time step, the leaders commit to dynamic
strategies based on the best responses of the followers, while the followers
compete against each other with no further information but the leaders'
strategy information. In this paper, we propose two learning algorithms to
schedule each cell's stochastic power levels, leading by the macrocells.
Numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed studies and show
that the two learning algorithms substantially improve the energy efficiency of
the femtocell networks."
"We study the problem of learning local metrics for nearest neighbor
classification. Most previous works on local metric learning learn a number of
local unrelated metrics. While this ""independence"" approach delivers an
increased flexibility its downside is the considerable risk of overfitting. We
present a new parametric local metric learning method in which we learn a
smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an approximation
error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local metrics as linear
combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over different regions
of the instance space. We constrain the metric matrix function by imposing on
the linear combinations manifold regularization which makes the learned metric
matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. Our
metric learning method has excellent performance both in terms of predictive
power and scalability. We experimented with several large-scale classification
problems, tens of thousands of instances, and compared it with several state of
the art metric learning methods, both global and local, as well as to SVM with
automatic kernel selection, all of which it outperforms in a significant
manner."
"Time series classification is a field which has drawn much attention over the
past decade. A new approach for classification of time series uses
classification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extracted
from one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach is
the time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. The
search for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengths
from all time series in the training set.
  A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapelets
space which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparative
analysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yields
the best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-quality
shapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomized
shapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders.
  We present an algorithm for randomized model generation for shapelet-based
classification that converges extremely quickly to a model with surprisingly
high accuracy after evaluating only an exceedingly small fraction of the
shapelets space."
"In many real-world applications such as text mining, it is desirable to
select the most relevant features or variables to improve the generalization
ability, or to provide a better interpretation of the prediction models. {In
this paper, a novel adaptive feature scaling (AFS) scheme is proposed by
introducing a feature scaling {vector $\d \in [0, 1]^m$} to alleviate the bias
problem brought by the scaling bias of the diverse features.} By reformulating
the resultant AFS model to semi-infinite programming problem, a novel feature
generating method is presented to identify the most relevant features for
classification problems. In contrast to the traditional feature selection
methods, the new formulation has the advantage of solving extremely
high-dimensional and large-scale problems. With an exact solution to the
worst-case analysis in the identification of relevant features, the proposed
feature generating scheme converges globally. More importantly, the proposed
scheme facilitates the group selection with or without special structures.
Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method {achieves} better or competitive
performance compared with the existing methods on (group) feature selection in
terms of generalization performance and training efficiency. The C++ and MATLAB
implementations of our algorithm can be available at
\emph{http://c2inet.sce.ntu.edu.sg/Mingkui/robust-FGM.rar}."
"In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation
(BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the
recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal
probability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be
predicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is
computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the
BP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each
active user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As
opposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving
the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the
recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the
recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a
training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),
we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of
the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to
the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)
and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision
accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a
new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability
while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems."
"We describe a bootstrapping algorithm to learn from partially labeled data,
and the results of an empirical study for using it to improve performance of
sentiment classification using up to 15 million unlabeled Amazon product
reviews. Our experiments cover semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation and
weakly supervised learning. In some cases our methods were able to reduce test
error by more than half using such large amount of data.
  NOTICE: This is only the supplementary material."
"We analyze an online learning algorithm that adaptively combines outputs of
two constituent algorithms (or the experts) running in parallel to model an
unknown desired signal. This online learning algorithm is shown to achieve (and
in some cases outperform) the mean-square error (MSE) performance of the best
constituent algorithm in the mixture in the steady-state. However, the MSE
analysis of this algorithm in the literature uses approximations and relies on
statistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an
analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real life
systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and, in many
cases, that are even chaotic. In this paper, we produce results in an
individual sequence manner. In particular, we relate the time-accumulated
squared estimation error of this online algorithm at any time over any interval
to the time accumulated squared estimation error of the optimal convex mixture
of the constituent algorithms directly tuned to the underlying signal in a
deterministic sense without any statistical assumptions. In this sense, our
analysis provides the transient, steady-state and tracking behavior of this
algorithm in a strong sense without any approximations in the derivations or
statistical assumptions on the underlying signals such that our results are
guaranteed to hold. We illustrate the introduced results through examples."
"We investigate online kernel algorithms which simultaneously process multiple
classification tasks while a fixed constraint is imposed on the size of their
active sets. We focus in particular on the design of algorithms that can
efficiently deal with problems where the number of tasks is extremely high and
the task data are large scale. Two new projection-based algorithms are
introduced to efficiently tackle those issues while presenting different trade
offs on how the available memory is managed with respect to the prior
information about the learning tasks. Theoretically sound budget algorithms are
devised by coupling the Randomized Budget Perceptron and the Forgetron
algorithms with the multitask kernel. We show how the two seemingly contrasting
properties of learning from multiple tasks and keeping a constant memory
footprint can be balanced, and how the sharing of the available space among
different tasks is automatically taken care of. We propose and discuss new
insights on the multitask kernel. Experiments show that online kernel multitask
algorithms running on a budget can efficiently tackle real world learning
problems involving multiple tasks."
"We introduce semi-supervised data classification algorithms based on total
variation (TV), Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), support vector machine
(SVM), Cheeger cut, labeled and unlabeled data points. We design binary and
multi-class semi-supervised classification algorithms. We compare the TV-based
classification algorithms with the related Laplacian-based algorithms, and show
that TV classification perform significantly better when the number of labeled
data is small."
"The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can compute the
maximum-likelihood (ML) or maximum a posterior (MAP) point estimate of the
mixture models or latent variable models such as latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA), which has been one of the most popular probabilistic topic modeling
methods in the past decade. However, batch EM has high time and space
complexities to learn big LDA models from big data streams. In this paper, we
present a fast online EM (FOEM) algorithm that infers the topic distribution
from the previously unseen documents incrementally with constant memory
requirements. Within the stochastic approximation framework, we show that FOEM
can converge to the local stationary point of the LDA's likelihood function. By
dynamic scheduling for the fast speed and parameter streaming for the low
memory usage, FOEM is more efficient for some lifelong topic modeling tasks
than the state-of-the-art online LDA algorithms to handle both big data and big
models (aka, big topic modeling) on just a PC."
"In this paper we derive an efficient algorithm to learn the parameters of
structured predictors in general graphical models. This algorithm blends the
learning and inference tasks, which results in a significant speedup over
traditional approaches, such as conditional random fields and structured
support vector machines. For this purpose we utilize the structures of the
predictors to describe a low dimensional structured prediction task which
encourages local consistencies within the different structures while learning
the parameters of the model. Convexity of the learning task provides the means
to enforce the consistencies between the different parts. The
inference-learning blending algorithm that we propose is guaranteed to converge
to the optimum of the low dimensional primal and dual programs. Unlike many of
the existing approaches, the inference-learning blending allows us to learn
efficiently high-order graphical models, over regions of any size, and very
large number of parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
while presenting state-of-the-art results in stereo estimation, semantic
segmentation, shape reconstruction, and indoor scene understanding."
"Boosting methods combine a set of moderately accurate weaklearners to form a
highly accurate predictor. Despite the practical importance of multi-class
boosting, it has received far less attention than its binary counterpart. In
this work, we propose a fully-corrective multi-class boosting formulation which
directly solves the multi-class problem without dividing it into multiple
binary classification problems. In contrast, most previous multi-class boosting
algorithms decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple binary boosting
problems. By explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the primal optimization
problem, we are able to construct a column generation-based fully-corrective
approach to boosting which directly optimizes multi-class classification
performance. The new approach not only updates all weak learners' coefficients
at every iteration, but does so in a manner flexible enough to accommodate
various loss functions and regularizations. For example, it enables us to
introduce structural sparsity through mixed-norm regularization to promote
group sparsity and feature sharing. Boosting with shared features is
particularly beneficial in complex prediction problems where features can be
expensive to compute. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our
direct multi-class boosting generalizes as well as, or better than, a range of
competing multi-class boosting methods. The end result is a highly effective
and compact ensemble classifier which can be trained in a distributed fashion."
"We consider continuous-time sparse stochastic processes from which we have
only a finite number of noisy/noiseless samples. Our goal is to estimate the
noiseless samples (denoising) and the signal in-between (interpolation
problem).
  By relying on tools from the theory of splines, we derive the joint a priori
distribution of the samples and show how this probability density function can
be factorized. The factorization enables us to tractably implement the maximum
a posteriori and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criteria as two statistical
approaches for estimating the unknowns. We compare the derived statistical
methods with well-known techniques for the recovery of sparse signals, such as
the $\ell_1$ norm and Log ($\ell_1$-$\ell_0$ relaxation) regularization
methods. The simulation results show that, under certain conditions, the
performance of the regularization techniques can be very close to that of the
MMSE estimator."
"In this paper, we consider the general scenario of resource sharing in a
decentralized system when the resource rewards/qualities are time-varying and
unknown to the users, and using the same resource by multiple users leads to
reduced quality due to resource sharing. Firstly, we consider a
user-independent reward model with no communication between the users, where a
user gets feedback about the congestion level in the resource it uses.
Secondly, we consider user-specific rewards and allow costly communication
between the users. The users have a cooperative goal of achieving the highest
system utility. There are multiple obstacles in achieving this goal such as the
decentralized nature of the system, unknown resource qualities, communication,
computation and switching costs. We propose distributed learning algorithms
with logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal allocation. Our logarithmic
regret result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian reward models, as well as
under communication, computation and switching costs."
"We define a hierarchical clustering method: $\alpha$-unchaining single
linkage or $SL(\alpha)$. The input of this algorithm is a finite metric space
and a certain parameter $\alpha$. This method is sensitive to the density of
the distribution and offers some solution to the so called chaining effect. We
also define a modified version, $SL^*(\alpha)$, to treat the chaining through
points or small blocks. We study the theoretical properties of these methods
and offer some theoretical background for the treatment of chaining effects."
"This work concerns a comparison of SVM kernel methods in text categorization
tasks. In particular I define a kernel function that estimates the similarity
between two objects computing by their compressed lengths. In fact, compression
algorithms can detect arbitrarily long dependencies within the text strings.
Data text vectorization looses information in feature extractions and is highly
sensitive by textual language. Furthermore, these methods are language
independent and require no text preprocessing. Moreover, the accuracy computed
on the datasets (Web-KB, 20ng and Reuters-21578), in some case, is greater than
Gaussian, linear and polynomial kernels. The method limits are represented by
computational time complexity of the Gram matrix and by very poor performance
on non-textual datasets."
"After a more than decade-long period of relatively little research activity
in the area of recurrent neural networks, several new developments will be
reviewed here that have allowed substantial progress both in understanding and
in technical solutions towards more efficient training of recurrent networks.
These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues
surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful
in what they can in principle represent in terms of modelling sequences,their
training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of
long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping
gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced
momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and
encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment.
The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined
effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test
error."
"We investigate the problem of transforming an input sequence into a
high-dimensional output sequence in order to transcribe polyphonic audio music
into symbolic notation. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a recurrent
neural network that is able to learn realistic output distributions given the
input and we devise an efficient algorithm to search for the global mode of
that distribution. The resulting method produces musically plausible
transcriptions even under high levels of noise and drastically outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches on five datasets of synthesized sounds and
real recordings, approximately halving the test error rate."
"In data mining applications, feature selection is an essential process since
it reduces a model's complexity. The cost of obtaining the feature values must
be taken into consideration in many domains. In this paper, we study the
cost-sensitive feature selection problem on numerical data with measurement
errors, test costs and misclassification costs. The major contributions of this
paper are four-fold. First, a new data model is built to address test costs and
misclassification costs as well as error boundaries. Second, a covering-based
rough set with measurement errors is constructed. Given a confidence interval,
the neighborhood is an ellipse in a two-dimension space, or an ellipsoidal in a
three-dimension space, etc. Third, a new cost-sensitive feature selection
problem is defined on this covering-based rough set. Fourth, both backtracking
and heuristic algorithms are proposed to deal with this new problem. The
algorithms are tested on six UCI (University of California - Irvine) data sets.
Experimental results show that (1) the pruning techniques of the backtracking
algorithm help reducing the number of operations significantly, and (2) the
heuristic algorithm usually obtains optimal results. This study is a step
toward realistic applications of cost-sensitive learning."
"Parsimony, including sparsity and low rank, has been shown to successfully
model data in numerous machine learning and signal processing tasks.
Traditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an iterative algorithm that
minimizes an objective function with parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently
sequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative
optimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring
real-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation
encountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusion
in discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move the
emphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centric
view of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministic
fixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. We
show a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures for
structured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration of
proximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact
parsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standard
optimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow to
naturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings.
State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several challenging problems in
image and audio processing with several orders of magnitude speedup compared to
the exact optimization algorithms."
"In this paper, we present our work on clustering and prediction of temporal
dynamics of global congestion configurations in large-scale road networks.
Instead of looking into temporal traffic state variation of individual links,
or of small areas, we focus on spatial congestion configurations of the whole
network. In our work, we aim at describing the typical temporal dynamic
patterns of this network-level traffic state and achieving long-term prediction
of the large-scale traffic dynamics, in a unified data-mining framework. To
this end, we formulate this joint task using Non-negative Tensor Factorization
(NTF), which has been shown to be a useful decomposition tools for multivariate
data sequences. Clustering and prediction are performed based on the compact
tensor factorization results. Experiments on large-scale simulated data
illustrate the interest of our method with promising results for long-term
forecast of traffic evolution."
"This paper presents a new hybrid Fuzzy-ART based K-Means Clustering technique
to solve the part machine grouping problem in cellular manufacturing systems
considering operational time. The performance of the proposed technique is
tested with problems from open literature and the results are compared to the
existing clustering models such as simple K-means algorithm and modified ART1
algorithm using an efficient modified performance measure known as modified
grouping efficiency (MGE) as found in the literature. The results support the
better performance of the proposed algorithm. The Novelty of this study lies in
the simple and efficient methodology to produce quick solutions for shop floor
managers with least computational efforts and time."
"We present a novel per-dimension learning rate method for gradient descent
called ADADELTA. The method dynamically adapts over time using only first order
information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic
gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and
appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture
choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. We show
promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification
task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed
cluster environment."
"One of the ultimate goals of Manifold Learning (ML) is to reconstruct an
unknown nonlinear low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional
observation space by a given set of data points from the manifold. We derive a
local lower bound for the maximum reconstruction error in a small neighborhood
of an arbitrary point. The lower bound is defined in terms of the distance
between tangent spaces to the original manifold and the estimated manifold at
the considered point and reconstructed point, respectively. We propose an
amplification of the ML, called Tangent Bundle ML, in which the proximity not
only between the original manifold and its estimator but also between their
tangent spaces is required. We present a new algorithm that solves this problem
and gives a new solution for the ML also."
"Organizing data into semantically more meaningful is one of the fundamental
modes of understanding and learning. Cluster analysis is a formal study of
methods for understanding and algorithm for learning. K-mean clustering
algorithm is one of the most fundamental and simple clustering algorithms. When
there is no prior knowledge about the distribution of data sets, K-mean is the
first choice for clustering with an initial number of clusters. In this paper a
novel distance metric called Design Specification (DS) distance measure
function is integrated with K-mean clustering algorithm to improve cluster
accuracy. The K-means algorithm with proposed distance measure maximizes the
cluster accuracy to 99.98% at P = 1.525, which is determined through the
iterative procedure. The performance of Design Specification (DS) distance
measure function with K - mean algorithm is compared with the performances of
other standard distance functions such as Euclidian, squared Euclidean, City
Block, and Chebshew similarity measures deployed with K-mean algorithm.The
proposed method is evaluated on the engineering materials database. The
experiments on cluster analysis and the outlier profiling show that these is an
excellent improvement in the performance of the proposed method."
"Stochastic multi-armed bandits solve the Exploration-Exploitation dilemma and
ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical
problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective.
In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of
risk-aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best
risk-return trade-off. This setting proves to be intrinsically more difficult
than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk
which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using
variance as a measure of risk, we introduce two new algorithms, investigate
their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results."
"This paper is concerned with learning binary classifiers under adversarial
label-noise. We introduce the problem of error-correction in learning where the
goal is to recover the original clean data from a label-manipulated version of
it, given (i) no constraints on the adversary other than an upper-bound on the
number of errors, and (ii) some regularity properties for the original data. We
present a simple and practical error-correction algorithm called SubSVMs that
learns individual SVMs on several small-size (log-size), class-balanced, random
subsets of the data and then reclassifies the training points using a majority
vote. Our analysis reveals the need for the two main ingredients of SubSVMs,
namely class-balanced sampling and subsampled bagging. Experimental results on
synthetic as well as benchmark UCI data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. In addition to noise-tolerance, log-size subsampled bagging also
yields significant run-time benefits over standard SVMs."
"This paper considers the use of a simple posterior sampling algorithm to
balance between exploration and exploitation when learning to optimize actions
such as in multi-armed bandit problems. The algorithm, also known as Thompson
Sampling, offers significant advantages over the popular upper confidence bound
(UCB) approach, and can be applied to problems with finite or infinite action
spaces and complicated relationships among action rewards. We make two
theoretical contributions. The first establishes a connection between posterior
sampling and UCB algorithms. This result lets us convert regret bounds
developed for UCB algorithms into Bayesian regret bounds for posterior
sampling. Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for
posterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model
classes. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder
dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards.
Compared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes,
our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger
than the best available for generalized linear models. Further, our analysis
provides insight into performance advantages of posterior sampling, which are
highlighted through simulation results that demonstrate performance surpassing
recently proposed UCB algorithms."
"We present an algorithm that learns representations which explicitly
compensate for domain mismatch and which can be efficiently realized as linear
classifiers. Specifically, we form a linear transformation that maps features
from the target (test) domain to the source (training) domain as part of
training the classifier. We optimize both the transformation and classifier
parameters jointly, and introduce an efficient cost function based on
misclassification loss. Our method combines several features previously
unavailable in a single algorithm: multi-class adaptation through
representation learning, ability to map across heterogeneous feature spaces,
and scalability to large datasets. We present experiments on several image
datasets that demonstrate improved accuracy and computational advantages
compared to previous approaches."
"We present a feature learning model that learns to encode relationships
between images. The model is defined as a Gated Boltzmann Machine, which is
constrained such that hidden units that are nearby in space can gate each
other's connections. We show how frequency/orientation ""columns"" as well as
topographic filter maps follow naturally from training the model on image
pairs. The model also helps explain why square-pooling models yield feature
groups with similar grouping properties. Experimental results on synthetic
image transformations show that spatially constrained gating is an effective
way to reduce the number of parameters and thereby to regularize a
transformation-learning model."
"Large-scale relational learning becomes crucial for handling the huge amounts
of structured data generated daily in many application domains ranging from
computational biology or information retrieval, to natural language processing.
In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed
multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the
original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the
semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible
components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link
prediction on standard datasets from the literature."
"In this correspondence, we will point out a problem with testing adaptive
classifiers on autocorrelated data. In such a case random change alarms may
boost the accuracy figures. Hence, we cannot be sure if the adaptation is
working well."
"We proposea graphical model for multi-view feature extraction that
automatically adapts its structure to achieve better representation of data
distribution. The proposed model, structure-adapting multi-view harmonium
(SA-MVH) has switch parameters that control the connection between hidden nodes
and input views, and learn the switch parameter while training. Numerical
experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the useful
behavior of the SA-MVH, compared to existing multi-view feature extraction
methods."
"We introduce a simple new regularizer for auto-encoders whose hidden-unit
activation functions contain at least one zero-gradient (saturated) region.
This regularizer explicitly encourages activations in the saturated region(s)
of the corresponding activation function. We call these Saturating
Auto-Encoders (SATAE). We show that the saturation regularizer explicitly
limits the SATAE's ability to reconstruct inputs which are not near the data
manifold. Furthermore, we show that a wide variety of features can be learned
when different activation functions are used. Finally, connections are
established with the Contractive and Sparse Auto-Encoders."
"We study the use of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a tool for the
recognition of agents' behavior on the basis of observation of their sequential
decision behavior interacting with the environment. We model the problem faced
by the agents as a Markov decision process (MDP) and model the observed
behavior of the agents in terms of forward planning for the MDP. We use IRL to
learn reward functions and then use these reward functions as the basis for
clustering or classification models. Experimental studies with GridWorld, a
navigation problem, and the secretary problem, an optimal stopping problem,
suggest reward vectors found from IRL can be a good basis for behavior pattern
recognition problems. Empirical comparisons of our method with several existing
IRL algorithms and with direct methods that use feature statistics observed in
state-action space suggest it may be superior for recognition problems."
"Several recent results in machine learning have established formal
connections between autoencoders---artificial neural network models that
attempt to reproduce their inputs---and other coding models like sparse coding
and K-means. This paper explores in depth an autoencoder model that is
constructed using rectified linear activations on its hidden units. Our
analysis builds on recent results to further unify the world of sparse linear
coding models. We provide an intuitive interpretation of the behavior of these
coding models and demonstrate this intuition using small, artificial datasets
with known distributions."
"Simultaneously solving multiple related learning tasks is beneficial under a
variety of circumstances, but the prior knowledge necessary to correctly model
task relationships is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we develop a
novel kernel-based multi-task learning technique that automatically reveals
structural inter-task relationships. Building over the framework of output
kernel learning (OKL), we introduce a method that jointly learns multiple
functions and a low-rank multi-task kernel by solving a non-convex
regularization problem. Optimization is carried out via a block coordinate
descent strategy, where each subproblem is solved using suitable conjugate
gradient (CG) type iterative methods for linear operator equations. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on pharmacological and
collaborative filtering data."
"Predicting the nodes of a given graph is a fascinating theoretical problem
with applications in several domains. Since graph sparsification via spanning
trees retains enough information while making the task much easier, trees are
an important special case of this problem. Although it is known how to predict
the nodes of an unweighted tree in a nearly optimal way, in the weighted case a
fully satisfactory algorithm is not available yet. We fill this hole and
introduce an efficient node predictor, Shazoo, which is nearly optimal on any
weighted tree. Moreover, we show that Shazoo can be viewed as a common
nontrivial generalization of both previous approaches for unweighted trees and
weighted lines. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that Shazoo performs
well in that it fully exploits the structure of the input tree, and gets very
close to (and sometimes better than) less scalable energy minimization methods."
"In online learning the performance of an algorithm is typically compared to
the performance of a fixed function from some class, with a quantity called
regret. Forster proposed a last-step min-max algorithm which was somewhat
simpler than the algorithm of Vovk, yet with the same regret. In fact the
algorithm he analyzed assumed that the choices of the adversary are bounded,
yielding artificially only the two extreme cases. We fix this problem by
weighing the examples in such a way that the min-max problem will be well
defined, and provide analysis with logarithmic regret that may have better
multiplicative factor than both bounds of Forster and Vovk. We also derive a
new bound that may be sub-logarithmic, as a recent bound of Orabona et.al, but
may have better multiplicative factor. Finally, we analyze the algorithm in a
weak-type of non-stationary setting, and show a bound that is sub-linear if the
non-stationarity is sub-linear as well."
"In this paper, we propose a data representation model that demonstrates
hierarchical feature learning using nsNMF. We extend unit algorithm into
several layers. Experiments with document and image data successfully
discovered feature hierarchies. We also prove that proposed method results in
much better classification and reconstruction performance, especially for small
number of features. feature hierarchies."
"Recommender systems are emerging technologies that nowadays can be found in
many applications such as Amazon, Netflix, and so on. These systems help users
to find relevant information, recommendations, and their preferred items.
Slightly improvement of the accuracy of these recommenders can highly affect
the quality of recommendations. Matrix Factorization is a popular method in
Recommendation Systems showing promising results in accuracy and complexity. In
this paper we propose an extension of matrix factorization which adds general
neighborhood information on the recommendation model. Users and items are
clustered into different categories to see how these categories share
preferences. We then employ these shared interests of categories in a fusion by
Biased Matrix Factorization to achieve more accurate recommendations. This is a
complement for the current neighborhood aware matrix factorization models which
rely on using direct neighborhood information of users and items. The proposed
model is tested on two well-known recommendation system datasets: Movielens100k
and Netflix. Our experiment shows applying the general latent features of
categories into factorized recommender models improves the accuracy of
recommendations. The current neighborhood-aware models need a great number of
neighbors to acheive good accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed model is better than or comparable with the current neighborhood-aware
models when they consider fewer number of neighbors."
"In this paper, a novel approach for the optimal combination of binary
classifiers is proposed. The classifier combination problem is approached from
a Game Theory perspective. The proposed framework of adapted weighted majority
rules (WMR) is tested against common rank-based, Bayesian and simple majority
models, as well as two soft-output averaging rules. Experiments with ensembles
of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Ordinary Binary Tree Classifiers (OBTC) and
weighted k-nearest-neighbor (w/k-NN) models on benchmark datasets indicate that
this new adaptive WMR model, employing local accuracy estimators and the
analytically computed optimal weights outperform all the other simple
combination rules."
"We propose a novel boosting approach to multi-class classification problems,
in which multiple classes are distinguished by a set of random projection
matrices in essence. The approach uses random projections to alleviate the
proliferation of binary classifiers typically required to perform multi-class
classification. The result is a multi-class classifier with a single
vector-valued parameter, irrespective of the number of classes involved. Two
variants of this approach are proposed. The first method randomly projects the
original data into new spaces, while the second method randomly projects the
outputs of learned weak classifiers. These methods are not only conceptually
simple but also effective and easy to implement. A series of experiments on
synthetic, machine learning and visual recognition data sets demonstrate that
our proposed methods compare favorably to existing multi-class boosting
algorithms in terms of both the convergence rate and classification accuracy."
"Canonical correlation analysis is a statistical technique that is used to
find relations between two sets of variables. An important extension in pattern
analysis is to consider more than two sets of variables. This problem can be
expressed as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), commonly
referred to Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA). This is a
non-convex problem and so greedy algorithms converge to local optima without
any guarantees on global optimality. In this paper, we show that despite being
highly structured, finding the optimal solution is NP-Hard. This motivates our
relaxation of the QCQP to a semidefinite program (SDP). The SDP is convex, can
be solved reasonably efficiently and comes with both absolute and
output-sensitive approximation quality. In addition to theoretical guarantees,
we do an extensive comparison of the QCQP method and the SDP relaxation on a
variety of synthetic and real world data. Finally, we present two useful
extensions: we incorporate kernel methods and computing multiple sets of
canonical vectors."
"We consider two scenarios of multiclass online learning of a hypothesis class
$H\subseteq Y^X$. In the {\em full information} scenario, the learner is
exposed to instances together with their labels. In the {\em bandit} scenario,
the true label is not exposed, but rather an indication whether the learner's
prediction is correct or not. We show that the ratio between the error rates in
the two scenarios is at most $8\cdot|Y|\cdot \log(|Y|)$ in the realizable case,
and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{|Y|})$ in the agnostic case. The results are tight up to a
logarithmic factor and essentially answer an open question from (Daniely et.
al. - Multiclass learnability and the erm principle).
  We apply these results to the class of $\gamma$-margin multiclass linear
classifiers in $\reals^d$. We show that the bandit error rate of this class is
$\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{|Y|}{\gamma^2})$ in the realizable case and
$\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{1}{\gamma}\sqrt{|Y|T})$ in the agnostic case. This
resolves an open question from (Kakade et. al. - Efficient bandit algorithms
for online multiclass prediction)."
"In this paper we consider learning in passive setting but with a slight
modification. We assume that the target expected loss, also referred to as
target risk, is provided in advance for learner as prior knowledge. Unlike most
studies in the learning theory that only incorporate the prior knowledge into
the generalization bounds, we are able to explicitly utilize the target risk in
the learning process. Our analysis reveals a surprising result on the sample
complexity of learning: by exploiting the target risk in the learning
algorithm, we show that when the loss function is both strongly convex and
smooth, the sample complexity reduces to $\O(\log (\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$, an
exponential improvement compared to the sample complexity
$\O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for learning with strongly convex loss functions.
Furthermore, our proof is constructive and is based on a computationally
efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for such settings which demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm is practically useful."
"We design and analyze minimax-optimal algorithms for online linear
optimization games where the player's choice is unconstrained. The player
strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a
post-hoc benchmark strategy. The standard benchmark is the loss of the best
strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set. When the the comparison set and
the adversary's gradients satisfy L_infinity bounds, we give the value of the
game in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -> infinity.
  Interesting algorithms result when we consider soft constraints on the
comparator, rather than restricting it to a bounded set. As a warmup, we
analyze the game with a quadratic penalty. The value of this game is exactly
T/2, and this value is achieved by perhaps the simplest online algorithm of
all: unprojected gradient descent with a constant learning rate.
  We then derive a minimax-optimal algorithm for a much softer penalty
function. This algorithm achieves good bounds under the standard notion of
regret for any comparator point, without needing to specify the comparator set
in advance. The value of this game converges to sqrt{e} as T ->infinity; we
give a closed-form for the exact value as a function of T. The resulting
algorithm is natural in unconstrained investment or betting scenarios, since it
guarantees at worst constant loss, while allowing for exponential reward
against an ""easy"" adversary."
"We propose a tree ensemble method, referred to as time series forest (TSF),
for time series classification. TSF employs a combination of the entropy gain
and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance)
gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance
gain criterion improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at
each tree node and has a computational complexity linear in the length of a
time series and can be built using parallel computing techniques such as
multi-core computing used here. The temporal importance curve is also proposed
to capture the important temporal characteristics useful for classification.
Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean,
deviation and slope outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor
classifiers with dynamic time warping, is computationally efficient, and can
provide insights into the temporal characteristics."
"Classification is widely used technique in the data mining domain, where
scalability and efficiency are the immediate problems in classification
algorithms for large databases. We suggest improvements to the existing C4.5
decision tree algorithm. In this paper attribute oriented induction (AOI) and
relevance analysis are incorporated with concept hierarchys knowledge and
HeightBalancePriority algorithm for construction of decision tree along with
Multi level mining. The assignment of priorities to attributes is done by
evaluating information entropy, at different levels of abstraction for building
decision tree using HeightBalancePriority algorithm. Modified DMQL queries are
used to understand and explore the shortcomings of the decision trees generated
by C4.5 classifier for education dataset and the results are compared with the
proposed approach."
"We derive sublinear regret bounds for undiscounted reinforcement learning in
continuous state space. The proposed algorithm combines state aggregation with
the use of upper confidence bounds for implementing optimism in the face of
uncertainty. Beside the existence of an optimal policy which satisfies the
Poisson equation, the only assumptions made are Holder continuity of rewards
and transition probabilities."
"The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement
learning problem is considered. Several models (functions mapping past
observations to a finite set) of the observations are given, and it is known
that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed
Markovian. Without knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor
what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting MDP, it is required
to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for
the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm
that achieves that, with a regret of order T^{2/3} where T is the horizon time."
"We consider an agent interacting with an environment in a single stream of
actions, observations, and rewards, with no reset. This process is not assumed
to be a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Rather, the agent has several
representations (mapping histories of past interactions to a discrete state
space) of the environment with unknown dynamics, only some of which result in
an MDP. The goal is to minimize the average regret criterion against an agent
who knows an MDP representation giving the highest optimal reward, and acts
optimally in it. Recent regret bounds for this setting are of order
$O(T^{2/3})$ with an additive term constant yet exponential in some
characteristics of the optimal MDP. We propose an algorithm whose regret after
$T$ time steps is $O(\sqrt{T})$, with all constants reasonably small. This is
optimal in $T$ since $O(\sqrt{T})$ is the optimal regret in the setting of
learning in a (single discrete) MDP."
"Distance metric learning is of fundamental interest in machine learning
because the distance metric employed can significantly affect the performance
of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular
approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite
programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. Standard
interior-point SDP solvers typically have a complexity of $O(D^{6.5})$ (with
$D$ the dimension of input data), and can thus only practically solve problems
exhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is
$D (D+1) / 2 $, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can
practically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the
popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of
problem to which metric learning can be applied. Here we propose a
significantly more efficient approach to the metric learning problem based on
the Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much
simpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric
learning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is
$O (D ^ 3) $, which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach.
Experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to
significantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method can be
applied to solve more general Frobenius-norm regularized SDP problems
approximately."
"Very recently crowdsourcing has become the de facto platform for distributing
and collecting human computation for a wide range of tasks and applications
such as information retrieval, natural language processing and machine
learning. Current crowdsourcing platforms have some limitations in the area of
quality control. Most of the effort to ensure good quality has to be done by
the experimenter who has to manage the number of workers needed to reach good
results.
  We propose a simple model for adaptive quality control in crowdsourced
multiple-choice tasks which we call the \emph{bandit survey problem}. This
model is related to, but technically different from the well-known multi-armed
bandit problem. We present several algorithms for this problem, and support
them with analysis and simulations. Our approach is based in our experience
conducting relevance evaluation for a large commercial search engine."
"Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly
combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured learning
has found many applications in computer vision. Inspired by structured support
vector machines (SSVM), here we propose a new boosting algorithm for structured
output prediction, which we refer to as StructBoost. StructBoost supports
nonlinear structured learning by combining a set of weak structured learners.
As SSVM generalizes SVM, our StructBoost generalizes standard boosting
approaches such as AdaBoost, or LPBoost to structured learning. The resulting
optimization problem of StructBoost is more challenging than SSVM in the sense
that it may involve exponentially many variables and constraints. In contrast,
for SSVM one usually has an exponential number of constraints and a
cutting-plane method is used. In order to efficiently solve StructBoost, we
formulate an equivalent $ 1 $-slack formulation and solve it using a
combination of cutting planes and column generation. We show the versatility
and usefulness of StructBoost on a range of problems such as optimizing the
tree loss for hierarchical multi-class classification, optimizing the Pascal
overlap criterion for robust visual tracking and learning conditional random
field parameters for image segmentation."
"Thompson Sampling has recently been shown to be optimal in the Bernoulli
Multi-Armed Bandit setting[Kaufmann et al., 2012]. This bandit problem assumes
stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the
real world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate
algorithms using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem.
We propose a Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point
mechanism to tackle this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases
with constant switching rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global
Switching), switching occurs independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching),
when the switching rate is known and when it must be inferred from data. This
leads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson
Sampling (CTS). We show empirical results of the algorithm in 4 artificial
environments, and 2 derived from real world data; news click-through[Yahoo!,
2011] and foreign exchange data[Dukascopy, 2012], comparing them to some other
bandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective."
"We investigate the generalizability of learned binary relations: functions
that map pairs of instances to a logical indicator. This problem has
application in numerous areas of machine learning, such as ranking, entity
resolution and link prediction. Our learning framework incorporates an example
labeler that, given a sequence $X$ of $n$ instances and a desired training size
$m$, subsamples $m$ pairs from $X \times X$ without replacement. The challenge
in analyzing this learning scenario is that pairwise combinations of random
variables are inherently dependent, which prevents us from using traditional
learning-theoretic arguments. We present a unified, graph-based analysis, which
allows us to analyze this dependence using well-known graph identities. We are
then able to bound the generalization error of learned binary relations using
Rademacher complexity and algorithmic stability. The rate of uniform
convergence is partially determined by the labeler's subsampling process. We
thus examine how various assumptions about subsampling affect generalization;
under a natural random subsampling process, our bounds guarantee
$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ uniform convergence."
"In adaptive dynamic programming, neurocontrol and reinforcement learning, the
objective is for an agent to learn to choose actions so as to minimise a total
cost function. In this paper we show that when discretized time is used to
model the motion of the agent, it can be very important to do ""clipping"" on the
motion of the agent in the final time step of the trajectory. By clipping we
mean that the final time step of the trajectory is to be truncated such that
the agent stops exactly at the first terminal state reached, and no distance
further. We demonstrate that when clipping is omitted, learning performance can
fail to reach the optimum; and when clipping is done properly, learning
performance can improve significantly.
  The clipping problem we describe affects algorithms which use explicit
derivatives of the model functions of the environment to calculate a learning
gradient. These include Backpropagation Through Time for Control, and methods
based on Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming. However the clipping problem does
not significantly affect methods based on Heuristic Dynamic Programming,
Temporal Differences or Policy Gradient Learning algorithms. Similarly, the
clipping problem does not affect fixed-length finite-horizon problems."
"We propose a version of the follow-the-perturbed-leader online prediction
algorithm in which the cumulative losses are perturbed by independent symmetric
random walks. The forecaster is shown to achieve an expected regret of the
optimal order O(sqrt(n log N)) where n is the time horizon and N is the number
of experts. More importantly, it is shown that the forecaster changes its
prediction at most O(sqrt(n log N)) times, in expectation. We also extend the
analysis to online combinatorial optimization and show that even in this more
general setting, the forecaster rarely switches between experts while having a
regret of near-optimal order."
"This paper addresses the problem of expressing a signal as a sum of frequency
components (sinusoids) wherein each sinusoid may exhibit abrupt changes in its
amplitude and/or phase. The Fourier transform of a narrow-band signal, with a
discontinuous amplitude and/or phase function, exhibits spectral and temporal
spreading. The proposed method aims to avoid such spreading by explicitly
modeling the signal of interest as a sum of sinusoids with time-varying
amplitudes. So as to accommodate abrupt changes, it is further assumed that the
amplitude/phase functions are approximately piecewise constant (i.e., their
time-derivatives are sparse). The proposed method is based on a convex
variational (optimization) approach wherein the total variation (TV) of the
amplitude functions are regularized subject to a perfect (or approximate)
reconstruction constraint. A computationally efficient algorithm is derived
based on convex optimization techniques. The proposed technique can be used to
perform band-pass filtering that is relatively insensitive to narrow-band
amplitude/phase jumps present in data, which normally pose a challenge (due to
transients, leakage, etc.). The method is illustrated using both synthetic
signals and human EEG data for the purpose of band-pass filtering and the
estimation of phase synchrony indexes."
"In this paper we address the problem of predicting a time series using the
ARMA (autoregressive moving average) model, under minimal assumptions on the
noise terms. Using regret minimization techniques, we develop effective online
learning algorithms for the prediction problem, without assuming that the noise
terms are Gaussian, identically distributed or even independent. Furthermore,
we show that our algorithm's performances asymptotically approaches the
performance of the best ARMA model in hindsight."
"The framework of online learning with memory naturally captures learning
problems with temporal constraints, and was previously studied for the experts
setting. In this work we extend the notion of learning with memory to the
general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework, and present two algorithms
that attain low regret. The first algorithm applies to Lipschitz continuous
loss functions, obtaining optimal regret bounds for both convex and strongly
convex losses. The second algorithm attains the optimal regret bounds and
applies more broadly to convex losses without requiring Lipschitz continuity,
yet is more complicated to implement. We complement our theoretic results with
an application to statistical arbitrage in finance: we devise algorithms for
constructing mean-reverting portfolios."
"We consider online similarity prediction problems over networked data. We
begin by relating this task to the more standard class prediction problem,
showing that, given an arbitrary algorithm for class prediction, we can
construct an algorithm for similarity prediction with ""nearly"" the same mistake
bound, and vice versa. After noticing that this general construction is
computationally infeasible, we target our study to {\em feasible} similarity
prediction algorithms on networked data. We initially assume that the network
structure is {\em known} to the learner. Here we observe that Matrix Winnow
\cite{w07} has a near-optimal mistake guarantee, at the price of cubic
prediction time per round. This motivates our effort for an efficient
implementation of a Perceptron algorithm with a weaker mistake guarantee but
with only poly-logarithmic prediction time. Our focus then turns to the
challenging case of networks whose structure is initially {\em unknown} to the
learner. In this novel setting, where the network structure is only
incrementally revealed, we obtain a mistake-bounded algorithm with a quadratic
prediction time per round."
"Fast nearest neighbor searching is becoming an increasingly important tool in
solving many large-scale problems. Recently a number of approaches to learning
data-dependent hash functions have been developed. In this work, we propose a
column generation based method for learning data-dependent hash functions on
the basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that
encode the pairwise proximity comparison information, our method learns hash
functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as
well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning
procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At
each iteration of the column generation procedure, the best hash function is
selected. Unlike most other hashing methods, our method generalizes to new data
points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex, thus ensuring
that the global optimum can be identified. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance
compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark
datasets."
"Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) has achieved state-of-the-art clustering
quality by performing spectral clustering over a $\ell^{1}$-norm based
similarity graph. However, SSC is a transductive method which does not handle
with the data not used to construct the graph (out-of-sample data). For each
new datum, SSC requires solving $n$ optimization problems in O(n) variables for
performing the algorithm over the whole data set, where $n$ is the number of
data points. Therefore, it is inefficient to apply SSC in fast online
clustering and scalable graphing. In this letter, we propose an inductive
spectral clustering algorithm, called inductive Sparse Subspace Clustering
(iSSC), which makes SSC feasible to cluster out-of-sample data. iSSC adopts the
assumption that high-dimensional data actually lie on the low-dimensional
manifold such that out-of-sample data could be grouped in the embedding space
learned from in-sample data. Experimental results show that iSSC is promising
in clustering out-of-sample data."
"In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data,
where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for
example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii)
multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering
where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with
weak labels involves a difficult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem.
Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local
minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the WellSVM via a novel
label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original
MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Definite Programming
(SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the WellSVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM
subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations.
Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised
learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in
content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate
improved performance, and WellSVM is also readily applicable on large data
sets."
"We propose a modular framework for multi-relational learning via tensor
decomposition. In our learning setting, the training data contains multiple
types of relationships among a set of objects, which we represent by a sparse
three-mode tensor. The goal is to predict the values of the missing entries. To
do so, we model each relationship as a function of a linear combination of
latent factors. We learn this latent representation by computing a low-rank
tensor decomposition, using quasi-Newton optimization of a weighted objective
function. Sparsity in the observed data is captured by the weighted objective,
leading to improved accuracy when training data is limited. Exploiting sparsity
also improves efficiency, potentially up to an order of magnitude over
unweighted approaches. In addition, our framework accommodates arbitrary
combinations of smooth, task-specific loss functions, making it better suited
for learning different types of relations. For the typical cases of real-valued
functions and binary relations, we propose several loss functions and derive
the associated parameter gradients. We evaluate our method on synthetic and
real data, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and scalability
over related factorization techniques."
"Mismatching problem between the source and target noisy corpora severely
hinder the practical use of the machine-learning-based voice activity detection
(VAD). In this paper, we try to address this problem in the transfer learning
prospective. Transfer learning tries to find a common learning machine or a
common feature subspace that is shared by both the source corpus and the target
corpus. The denoising deep neural network is used as the learning machine.
Three transfer techniques, which aim to learn common feature representations,
are used for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the transfer learning schemes on the mismatch problem."
"Multitask clustering tries to improve the clustering performance of multiple
tasks simultaneously by taking their relationship into account. Most existing
multitask clustering algorithms fall into the type of generative clustering,
and none are formulated as convex optimization problems. In this paper, we
propose two convex Discriminative Multitask Clustering (DMTC) algorithms to
address the problems. Specifically, we first propose a Bayesian DMTC framework.
Then, we propose two convex DMTC objectives within the framework. The first
one, which can be seen as a technical combination of the convex multitask
feature learning and the convex Multiclass Maximum Margin Clustering (M3C),
aims to learn a shared feature representation. The second one, which can be
seen as a combination of the convex multitask relationship learning and M3C,
aims to learn the task relationship. The two objectives are solved in a uniform
procedure by the efficient cutting-plane algorithm. Experimental results on a
toy problem and two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms."
"One important classifier ensemble for multiclass classification problems is
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOCs). It bridges multiclass problems and
binary-class classifiers by decomposing multiclass problems to a serial
binary-class problems. In this paper, we present a heuristic ternary code,
named Weight Optimization and Layered Clustering-based ECOC (WOLC-ECOC). It
starts with an arbitrary valid ECOC and iterates the following two steps until
the training risk converges. The first step, named Layered Clustering based
ECOC (LC-ECOC), constructs multiple strong classifiers on the most confusing
binary-class problem. The second step adds the new classifiers to ECOC by a
novel Optimized Weighted (OW) decoding algorithm, where the optimization
problem of the decoding is solved by the cutting plane algorithm. Technically,
LC-ECOC makes the heuristic training process not blocked by some difficult
binary-class problem. OW decoding guarantees the non-increase of the training
risk for ensuring a small code length. Results on 14 UCI datasets and a music
genre classification problem demonstrate the effectiveness of WOLC-ECOC."
"The goal of a learner in standard online learning is to maintain an average
loss close to the loss of the best-performing single function in some class. In
many real-world problems, such as rating or ranking items, there is no single
best target function during the runtime of the algorithm, instead the best
(local) target function is drifting over time. We develop a novel last-step
minmax optimal algorithm in context of a drift. We analyze the algorithm in the
worst-case regret framework and show that it maintains an average loss close to
that of the best slowly changing sequence of linear functions, as long as the
total of drift is sublinear. In some situations, our bound improves over
existing bounds, and additionally the algorithm suffers logarithmic regret when
there is no drift. We also build on the H_infinity filter and its bound, and
develop and analyze a second algorithm for drifting setting. Synthetic
simulations demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms in a worst-case
constant drift setting."
"Quorum sensing is a decentralized biological process, through which a
community of cells with no global awareness coordinate their functional
behaviors based solely on cell-medium interactions and local decisions. This
paper draws inspirations from quorum sensing and colony competition to derive a
new algorithm for data clustering. The algorithm treats each data as a single
cell, and uses knowledge of local connectivity to cluster cells into multiple
colonies simultaneously. It simulates auto-inducers secretion in quorum sensing
to tune the influence radius for each cell. At the same time, sparsely
distributed core cells spread their influences to form colonies, and
interactions between colonies eventually determine each cell's identity. The
algorithm has the flexibility to analyze not only static but also time-varying
data, which surpasses the capacity of many existing algorithms. Its stability
and convergence properties are established. The algorithm is tested on several
applications, including both synthetic and real benchmarks data sets, alleles
clustering, community detection, image segmentation. In particular, the
algorithm's distinctive capability to deal with time-varying data allows us to
experiment it on novel applications such as robotic swarms grouping and
switching model identification. We believe that the algorithm's promising
performance would stimulate many more exciting applications."
"In imbalanced multi-class classification problems, the misclassification rate
as an error measure may not be a relevant choice. Several methods have been
developed where the performance measure retained richer information than the
mere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information,
etc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we
propose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to
be optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show
that using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite
interesting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix,
especially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then
consists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix
gives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing
with imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we
propose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method --- namely
AdaBoost.MM --- to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing the
empirical norm of the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the
properties of the proposed method is presented, while experimental results
illustrate the behavior of the algorithm and show the relevancy of the approach
compared to other methods."
"Since Hamming distances can be calculated by bitwise computations, they can
be calculated with less computational load than L2 distances. Similarity
searches can therefore be performed faster in Hamming distance space. The
elements of Hamming distance space are bit strings. On the other hand, the
arrangement of hyperplanes induce the transformation from the feature vectors
into feature bit strings. This transformation method is a type of
locality-sensitive hashing that has been attracting attention as a way of
performing approximate similarity searches at high speed. Supervised learning
of hyperplane arrangements allows us to obtain a method that transforms them
into feature bit strings reflecting the information of labels applied to
higher-dimensional feature vectors. In this p aper, we propose a supervised
learning method for hyperplane arrangements in feature space that uses a Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We consider the probability density functions
used during learning, and evaluate their performance. We also consider the
sampling method for learning data pairs needed in learning, and we evaluate its
performance. We confirm that the accuracy of this learning method when using a
suitable probability density function and sampling method is greater than the
accuracy of existing learning methods."
"We reduce the memory footprint of popular large-scale online learning methods
by projecting our weight vector onto a coarse discrete set using randomized
rounding. Compared to standard 32-bit float encodings, this reduces RAM usage
by more than 50% during training and by up to 95% when making predictions from
a fixed model, with almost no loss in accuracy. We also show that randomized
counting can be used to implement per-coordinate learning rates, improving
model quality with little additional RAM. We prove these memory-saving methods
achieve regret guarantees similar to their exact variants. Empirical evaluation
confirms excellent performance, dominating standard approaches across memory
versus accuracy tradeoffs."
"The k-support norm has been recently introduced to perform correlated
sparsity regularization. Although Argyriou et al. only reported experiments
using squared loss, here we apply it to several other commonly used settings
resulting in novel machine learning algorithms with interesting and familiar
limit cases. Source code for the algorithms described here is available."
"Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to
their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may
operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that
preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning
techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure
embedded in the original high-dimensional data. The complexity of these models,
and the problems with out-of-sample data, have previously rendered them
unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, we
consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds.
In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, we describe an efficient,
inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which
non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method.
Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing
techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning
approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t-SNE ."
"Traditional algorithms for stochastic optimization require projecting the
solution at each iteration into a given domain to ensure its feasibility. When
facing complex domains, such as positive semi-definite cones, the projection
operation can be expensive, leading to a high computational cost per iteration.
In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that aims to reduce the number of
projections for stochastic optimization. The proposed algorithm combines the
strength of several recent developments in stochastic optimization, including
mini-batch, extra-gradient, and epoch gradient descent, in order to effectively
explore the smoothness and strong convexity. We show, both in expectation and
with a high probability, that when the objective function is both smooth and
strongly convex, the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal $O(1/T)$ rate of
convergence with only $O(\log T)$ projections. Our empirical study verifies the
theoretical result."
"Distance metric learning (DML) is an important task that has found
applications in many domains. The high computational cost of DML arises from
the large number of variables to be determined and the constraint that a
distance metric has to be a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix. Although
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been successfully applied to improve the
efficiency of DML, it can still be computationally expensive because in order
to ensure that the solution is a PSD matrix, it has to, at every iteration,
project the updated distance metric onto the PSD cone, an expensive operation.
We address this challenge by developing two strategies within SGD, i.e.
mini-batch and adaptive sampling, to effectively reduce the number of updates
(i.e., projections onto the PSD cone) in SGD. We also develop hybrid approaches
that combine the strength of adaptive sampling with that of mini-batch online
learning techniques to further improve the computational efficiency of SGD for
DML. We prove the theoretical guarantees for both adaptive sampling and
mini-batch based approaches for DML. We also conduct an extensive empirical
study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for DML."
"Applications of non-linear kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to large
datasets is seriously hampered by its excessive training time. We propose a
modification, called the approximate extreme points support vector machine
(AESVM), that is aimed at overcoming this burden. Our approach relies on
conducting the SVM optimization over a carefully selected subset, called the
representative set, of the training dataset. We present analytical results that
indicate the similarity of AESVM and SVM solutions. A linear time algorithm
based on convex hulls and extreme points is used to compute the representative
set in kernel space. Extensive computational experiments on nine datasets
compared AESVM to LIBSVM \citep{LIBSVM}, CVM \citep{Tsang05}, BVM
\citep{Tsang07}, LASVM \citep{Bordes05}, $\text{SVM}^{\text{perf}}$
\citep{Joachims09}, and the random features method \citep{rahimi07}. Our AESVM
implementation was found to train much faster than the other methods, while its
classification accuracy was similar to that of LIBSVM in all cases. In
particular, for a seizure detection dataset, AESVM training was almost $10^3$
times faster than LIBSVM and LASVM and more than forty times faster than CVM
and BVM. Additionally, AESVM also gave competitively fast classification times."
"Online learning algorithms are fast, memory-efficient, easy to implement, and
applicable to many prediction problems, including classification, regression,
and ranking. Several online algorithms were proposed in the past few decades,
some based on additive updates, like the Perceptron, and some on multiplicative
updates, like Winnow. A unifying perspective on the design and the analysis of
online algorithms is provided by online mirror descent, a general prediction
strategy from which most first-order algorithms can be obtained as special
cases. We generalize online mirror descent to time-varying regularizers with
generic updates. Unlike standard mirror descent, our more general formulation
also captures second order algorithms, algorithms for composite losses and
algorithms for adaptive filtering. Moreover, we recover, and sometimes improve,
known regret bounds as special cases of our analysis using specific
regularizers. Finally, we show the power of our approach by deriving a new
second order algorithm with a regret bound invariant with respect to arbitrary
rescalings of individual features."
"Many studies in data mining have proposed a new learning called
semi-Supervised. Such type of learning combines unlabeled and labeled data
which are hard to obtain. However, in unsupervised methods, the only unlabeled
data are used. The problem of significance and the effectiveness of
semi-supervised clustering results is becoming of main importance. This paper
pursues the thesis that muchgreater accuracy can be achieved in such clustering
by improving the similarity computing. Hence, we introduce a new approach of
semisupervised clustering using an innovative new homogeneity measure of
generated clusters. Our experimental results demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy as a result."
"In recent years, a great many methods of learning from multi-view data by
considering the diversity of different views have been proposed. These views
may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying
to organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of
multi-view learning approaches, we review a number of representative multi-view
learning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1)
co-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace learning. Notably,
co-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement
on two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit
kernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either
linearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning
algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming
that the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is
significant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve
learning performance, they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the
complementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since
accessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning, with the
exception of study on learning a model from multiple views, it is also valuable
to study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views.
Overall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different
views, multi-view learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has
better generalization ability than single-view learning."
"We consider the stochastic and adversarial settings of continuum armed
bandits where the arms are indexed by [0,1]^d. The reward functions r:[0,1]^d
-> R are assumed to intrinsically depend on at most k coordinate variables
implying r(x_1,..,x_d) = g(x_{i_1},..,x_{i_k}) for distinct and unknown
i_1,..,i_k from {1,..,d} and some locally Holder continuous g:[0,1]^k -> R with
exponent 0 < alpha <= 1. Firstly, assuming (i_1,..,i_k) to be fixed across
time, we propose a simple modification of the CAB1 algorithm where we construct
the discrete set of sampling points to obtain a bound of
O(n^((alpha+k)/(2*alpha+k)) (log n)^((alpha)/(2*alpha+k)) C(k,d)) on the
regret, with C(k,d) depending at most polynomially in k and sub-logarithmically
in d. The construction is based on creating partitions of {1,..,d} into k
disjoint subsets and is probabilistic, hence our result holds with high
probability. Secondly we extend our results to also handle the more general
case where (i_1,...,i_k) can change over time and derive regret bounds for the
same."
"We consider the problem of embedding entities and relations of knowledge
bases in low-dimensional vector spaces. Unlike most existing approaches, which
are primarily efficient for modeling equivalence relations, our approach is
designed to explicitly model irreflexive relations, such as hierarchies, by
interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings
of the entities. Preliminary experiments show that, despite its simplicity and
a smaller number of parameters than previous approaches, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance according to standard evaluation protocols on data
from WordNet and Freebase."
"Fractals are self-similar recursive structures that have been used in
modeling several real world processes. In this work we study how ""fractal-like""
processes arise in a prediction game where an adversary is generating a
sequence of bits and an algorithm is trying to predict them. We will see that
under a certain formalization of the predictive payoff for the algorithm it is
most optimal for the adversary to produce a fractal-like sequence to minimize
the algorithm's ability to predict. Indeed it has been suggested before that
financial markets exhibit a fractal-like behavior. We prove that a fractal-like
distribution arises naturally out of an optimization from the adversary's
perspective.
  In addition, we give optimal trade-offs between predictability and expected
deviation (i.e. sum of bits) for our formalization of predictive payoff. This
result is motivated by the observation that several time series data exhibit
higher deviations than expected for a completely random walk."
"We consider the unsupervised learning problem of assigning labels to
unlabeled data. A naive approach is to use clustering methods, but this works
well only when data is properly clustered and each cluster corresponds to an
underlying class. In this paper, we first show that this unsupervised labeling
problem in balanced binary cases can be solved if two unlabeled datasets having
different class balances are available. More specifically, estimation of the
sign of the difference between probability densities of two unlabeled datasets
gives the solution. We then introduce a new method to directly estimate the
sign of the density difference without density estimation. Finally, we
demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method against several clustering
methods on various toy problems and real-world datasets."
"We present a brief survey of existing mistake bounds and introduce novel
bounds for the Perceptron or the kernel Perceptron algorithm. Our novel bounds
generalize beyond standard margin-loss type bounds, allow for any convex and
Lipschitz loss function, and admit a very simple proof."
"Deep learning research aims at discovering learning algorithms that discover
multiple levels of distributed representations, with higher levels representing
more abstract concepts. Although the study of deep learning has already led to
impressive theoretical results, learning algorithms and breakthrough
experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some
of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning
algorithms to much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization
difficulties due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient
and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the
factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few
forward-looking research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges."
"In this study, a novel machine learning algorithm, restricted Boltzmann
machine (RBM), is introduced. The algorithm is applied for the spectral
classification in astronomy. RBM is a bipartite generative graphical model with
two separate layers (one visible layer and one hidden layer), which can extract
higher level features to represent the original data. Despite generative, RBM
can be used for classification when modified with a free energy and a soft-max
function. Before spectral classification, the original data is binarized
according to some rule. Then we resort to the binary RBM to classify
cataclysmic variables (CVs) and non-CVs (one half of all the given data for
training and the other half for testing). The experiment result shows
state-of-the-art accuracy of 100%, which indicates the efficiency of the binary
RBM algorithm."
"Methods for analyzing or learning from ""fuzzy data"" have attracted increasing
attention in recent years. In many cases, however, existing methods (for
precise, non-fuzzy data) are extended to the fuzzy case in an ad-hoc manner,
and without carefully considering the interpretation of a fuzzy set when being
used for modeling data. Distinguishing between an ontic and an epistemic
interpretation of fuzzy set-valued data, and focusing on the latter, we argue
that a ""fuzzification"" of learning algorithms based on an application of the
generic extension principle is not appropriate. In fact, the extension
principle fails to properly exploit the inductive bias underlying statistical
and machine learning methods, although this bias, at least in principle, offers
a means for ""disambiguating"" the fuzzy data. Alternatively, we therefore
propose a method which is based on the generalization of loss functions in
empirical risk minimization, and which performs model identification and data
disambiguation simultaneously. Elaborating on the fuzzification of specific
types of losses, we establish connections to well-known loss functions in
regression and classification. We compare our approach with related methods and
illustrate its use in logistic regression for binary classification."
"Representation learning and unsupervised learning are two central topics of
machine learning and signal processing. Deep learning is one of the most
effective unsupervised representation learning approach. The main contributions
of this paper to the topics are as follows. (i) We propose to view the
representative deep learning approaches as special cases of the knowledge reuse
framework of clustering ensemble. (ii) We propose to view sparse coding when
used as a feature encoder as the consensus function of clustering ensemble, and
view dictionary learning as the training process of the base clusterings of
clustering ensemble. (ii) Based on the above two views, we propose a very
simple deep learning algorithm, named deep random model ensemble (DRME). It is
a stack of random model ensembles. Each random model ensemble is a special
k-means ensemble that discards the expectation-maximization optimization of
each base k-means but only preserves the default initialization method of the
base k-means. (iv) We propose to select the most powerful representation among
the layers by applying DRME to clustering where the single-linkage is used as
the clustering algorithm. Moreover, the DRME based clustering can also detect
the number of the natural clusters accurately. Extensive experimental
comparisons with 5 representation learning methods on 19 benchmark data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of DRME."
"We consider the classical question of predicting binary sequences and study
the {\em optimal} algorithms for obtaining the best possible regret and payoff
functions for this problem. The question turns out to be also equivalent to the
problem of optimal trade-offs between the regrets of two experts in an ""experts
problem"", studied before by \cite{kearns-regret}. While, say, a regret of
$\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ is known, we argue that it important to ask what is the
provably optimal algorithm for this problem --- both because it leads to
natural algorithms, as well as because regret is in fact often comparable in
magnitude to the final payoffs and hence is a non-negligible term.
  In the basic setting, the result essentially follows from a classical result
of Cover from '65. Here instead, we focus on another standard setting, of
time-discounted payoffs, where the final ""stopping time"" is not specified. We
exhibit an explicit characterization of the optimal regret for this setting.
  To obtain our main result, we show that the optimal payoff functions have to
satisfy the Hermite differential equation, and hence are given by the solutions
to this equation. It turns out that characterization of the payoff function is
qualitatively different from the classical (non-discounted) setting, and,
namely, there's essentially a unique optimal solution."
"AUC is an important performance measure and many algorithms have been devoted
to AUC optimization, mostly by minimizing a surrogate convex loss on a training
data set. In this work, we focus on one-pass AUC optimization that requires
only going through the training data once without storing the entire training
dataset, where conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied
directly because AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of
instances from different classes. We develop a regression-based algorithm which
only needs to maintain the first and second order statistics of training data
in memory, resulting a storage requirement independent from the size of
training data. To efficiently handle high dimensional data, we develop a
randomized algorithm that approximates the covariance matrices by low rank
matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm."
"In last few years there are major changes and evolution has been done on
classification of data. As the application area of technology is increases the
size of data also increases. Classification of data becomes difficult because
of unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become
greatest issue in data mining. Imbalance problem occur where one of the two
classes having more sample than other classes. The most of algorithm are more
focusing on classification of major sample while ignoring or misclassifying
minority sample. The minority samples are those that rarely occur but very
important. There are different methods available for classification of
imbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic
approach, data-preprocessing approach and feature selection approach. Each of
this technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper
systematic study of each approach is define which gives the right direction for
research in class imbalance problem."
"In the internet era there has been an explosion in the amount of digital text
information available, leading to difficulties of scale for traditional
inference algorithms for topic models. Recent advances in stochastic
variational inference algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have
made it feasible to learn topic models on large-scale corpora, but these
methods do not currently take full advantage of the collapsed representation of
the model. We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian
inference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the
art method. We show connections between collapsed variational Bayesian
inference and MAP estimation for LDA, and leverage these connections to prove
convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. In experiments on large-scale
text corpora, the algorithm was found to converge faster and often to a better
solution than the previous method. Human-subject experiments also demonstrated
that the method can learn coherent topics in seconds on small corpora,
facilitating the use of topic models in interactive document analysis software."
"We consider the problem of online combinatorial optimization under
semi-bandit feedback. The goal of the learner is to sequentially select its
actions from a combinatorial decision set so as to minimize its cumulative
loss. We propose a learning algorithm for this problem based on combining the
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method with a novel loss
estimation procedure called Geometric Resampling (GR). Contrary to previous
solutions, the resulting algorithm can be efficiently implemented for any
decision set where efficient offline combinatorial optimization is possible at
all. Assuming that the elements of the decision set can be described with
d-dimensional binary vectors with at most m non-zero entries, we show that the
expected regret of our algorithm after T rounds is O(m sqrt(dT log d)). As a
side result, we also improve the best known regret bounds for FPL in the full
information setting to O(m^(3/2) sqrt(T log d)), gaining a factor of sqrt(d/m)
over previous bounds for this algorithm."
"Stochastic neurons can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning
models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the
gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic
neurons, i.e., can we ""back-propagate"" through these stochastic neurons? We
examine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of
solutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated
that a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but
noisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron
firing probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small
perturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this
estimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is
small. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very
general settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the
estimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in
reinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating
this unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a
biased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of
the gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of
the gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold,
but like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is
similar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many
inputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be
convenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and
sparse gradients."
"Auto-encoder is a special kind of neural network based on reconstruction.
De-noising auto-encoder (DAE) is an improved auto-encoder which is robust to
the input by corrupting the original data first and then reconstructing the
original input by minimizing the reconstruction error function. And contractive
auto-encoder (CAE) is another kind of improved auto-encoder to learn robust
feature by introducing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobean matrix of the learned
feature with respect to the original input. In this paper, we combine
de-noising auto-encoder and contractive auto- encoder, and propose another
improved auto-encoder, contractive de-noising auto- encoder (CDAE), which is
robust to both the original input and the learned feature. We stack CDAE to
extract more abstract features and apply SVM for classification. The experiment
result on benchmark dataset MNIST shows that our proposed CDAE performed better
than both DAE and CAE, proving the effective of our method."
"We present a novel approach for the construction of ensemble classifiers
based on dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods represent
datasets using a small number of attributes while preserving the information
conveyed by the original dataset. The ensemble members are trained based on
dimension-reduced versions of the training set. These versions are obtained by
applying dimensionality reduction to the original training set using different
values of the input parameters. This construction meets both the diversity and
accuracy criteria which are required to construct an ensemble classifier where
the former criterion is obtained by the various input parameter values and the
latter is achieved due to the decorrelation and noise reduction properties of
dimensionality reduction. In order to classify a test sample, it is first
embedded into the dimension reduced space of each individual classifier by
using an out-of-sample extension algorithm. Each classifier is then applied to
the embedded sample and the classification is obtained via a voting scheme. We
present three variations of the proposed approach based on the Random
Projections, the Diffusion Maps and the Random Subspaces dimensionality
reduction algorithms. We also present a multi-strategy ensemble which combines
AdaBoost and Diffusion Maps. A comparison is made with the Bagging, AdaBoost,
Rotation Forest ensemble classifiers and also with the base classifier which
does not incorporate dimensionality reduction. Our experiments used seventeen
benchmark datasets from the UCI repository. The results obtained by the
proposed algorithms were superior in many cases to other algorithms."
"Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly
capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the
corruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error,
and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for
sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and
Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the
training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of
the underlying data-generating distribution when the data are discrete, or
using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another
issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of
small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem,
which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption,
arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both
discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to
non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty)."
"Many solutions to cost-sensitive classification (and regression) rely on some
or all of the following assumptions: we have complete knowledge about the cost
context at training time, we can easily re-train whenever the cost context
changes, and we have technique-specific methods (such as cost-sensitive
decision trees) that can take advantage of that information. In this paper we
address the problem of selecting models and minimising joint cost (integrating
both misclassification cost and test costs) without any of the above
assumptions. We introduce methods and plots (such as the so-called JROC plots)
that can work with any off-the-shelf predictive technique, including ensembles,
such that we reframe the model to use the appropriate subset of attributes (the
feature configuration) during deployment time. In other words, models are
trained with the available attributes (once and for all) and then deployed by
setting missing values on the attributes that are deemed ineffective for
reducing the joint cost. As the number of feature configuration combinations
grows exponentially with the number of features we introduce quadratic methods
that are able to approximate the optimal configuration and model choices, as
shown by the experimental results."
"The ACT-R theory of cognition developed by John Anderson and colleagues
endeavors to explain how humans recall chunks of information and how they solve
problems. ACT-R also serves as a theoretical basis for ""cognitive tutors"",
i.e., automatic tutoring systems that help students learn mathematics, computer
programming, and other subjects. The official ACT-R definition is distributed
across a large body of literature spanning many articles and monographs, and
hence it is difficult for an ""outsider"" to learn the most important aspects of
the theory. This paper aims to provide a tutorial to the core components of the
ACT-R theory."
"Random Forest (RF) is a powerful supervised learner and has been popularly
used in many applications such as bioinformatics.
  In this work we propose the guided random forest (GRF) for feature selection.
Similar to a feature selection method called guided regularized random forest
(GRRF), GRF is built using the importance scores from an ordinary RF. However,
the trees in GRRF are built sequentially, are highly correlated and do not
allow for parallel computing, while the trees in GRF are built independently
and can be implemented in parallel. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional gene
data sets show that, with a fixed parameter value (without tuning the
parameter), RF applied to features selected by GRF outperforms RF applied to
all features on 9 data sets and 7 of them have significant differences at the
0.05 level. Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly
improved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better
classification accuracy. Note in this work the guided random forest is guided
by the importance scores from an ordinary random forest, however, it can also
be guided by other methods such as human insights (by specifying $\lambda_i$).
GRF can be used in ""RRF"" v1.4 (and later versions), a package that also
includes the regularized random forest methods."
"We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an
alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks
(GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition
distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state,
generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer
dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier
to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like
learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can
be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the
probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way
an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized
pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution
and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can
be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables
given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two
image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine
Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the
need for layerwise pretraining."
"Feature selection (FS) is a process which attempts to select more informative
features. In some cases, too many redundant or irrelevant features may
overpower main features for classification. Feature selection can remedy this
problem and therefore improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the
computational overhead of classification algorithms. The main aim of feature
selection is to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while
retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original features. In
this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Rough PCA, Unsupervised Quick
Reduct (USQR) algorithm and Empirical Distribution Ranking (EDR) approaches are
applied to discover discriminative features that will be the most adequate ones
for classification. Efficiency of the approaches is evaluated using standard
classification metrics."
"We propose a learning setting in which unlabeled data is free, and the cost
of a label depends on its value, which is not known in advance. We study binary
classification in an extreme case, where the algorithm only pays for negative
labels. Our motivation are applications such as fraud detection, in which
investigating an honest transaction should be avoided if possible. We term the
setting auditing, and consider the auditing complexity of an algorithm: the
number of negative labels the algorithm requires in order to learn a hypothesis
with low relative error. We design auditing algorithms for simple hypothesis
classes (thresholds and rectangles), and show that with these algorithms, the
auditing complexity can be significantly lower than the active label
complexity. We also discuss a general competitive approach for auditing and
possible modifications to the framework."
"Learning an appropriate (dis)similarity function from the available data is a
central problem in machine learning, since the success of many machine learning
algorithms critically depends on the choice of a similarity function to compare
examples. Despite many approaches for similarity metric learning have been
proposed, there is little theoretical study on the links between similarity
met- ric learning and the classification performance of the result classifier.
In this paper, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation
associated with general matrix-norms, and establish their generalization
bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear separator
can be bounded by the derived generalization bound of similarity learning. This
shows that a good gen- eralization of the learnt similarity function guarantees
a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Our results extend
and improve those obtained by Bellet at al. [3]. Due to the techniques
dependent on the notion of uniform stability [6], the bound obtained there
holds true only for the Frobenius matrix- norm regularization. Our techniques
using the Rademacher complexity [5] and its related Khinchin-type inequality
enable us to establish bounds for regularized similarity learning formulations
associated with general matrix-norms including sparse L 1 -norm and mixed
(2,1)-norm."
"We carefully investigate the on-line version of PCA, where in each trial a
learning algorithm plays a k-dimensional subspace, and suffers the compression
loss on the next instance when projected into the chosen subspace. In this
setting, we analyze two popular on-line algorithms, Gradient Descent (GD) and
Exponentiated Gradient (EG). We show that both algorithms are essentially
optimal in the worst-case. This comes as a surprise, since EG is known to
perform sub-optimally when the instances are sparse. This different behavior of
EG for PCA is mainly related to the non-negativity of the loss in this case,
which makes the PCA setting qualitatively different from other settings studied
in the literature. Furthermore, we show that when considering regret bounds as
function of a loss budget, EG remains optimal and strictly outperforms GD.
Next, we study the extension of the PCA setting, in which the Nature is allowed
to play with dense instances, which are positive matrices with bounded largest
eigenvalue. Again we can show that EG is optimal and strictly better than GD in
this setting."
"We solve the COLT 2013 open problem of \citet{SCB} on minimizing regret in
the setting of advice-efficient multiarmed bandits with expert advice. We give
an algorithm for the setting of K arms and N experts out of which we are
allowed to query and use only M experts' advices in each round, which has a
regret bound of \tilde{O}\bigP{\sqrt{\frac{\min\{K, M\} N}{M} T}} after T
rounds. We also prove that any algorithm for this problem must have expected
regret at least \tilde{\Omega}\bigP{\sqrt{\frac{\min\{K, M\} N}{M}T}}, thus
showing that our upper bound is nearly tight."
"What if there is a teacher who knows the learning goal and wants to design
good training data for a machine learner? We propose an optimal teaching
framework aimed at learners who employ Bayesian models. Our framework is
expressed as an optimization problem over teaching examples that balance the
future loss of the learner and the effort of the teacher. This optimization
problem is in general hard. In the case where the learner employs conjugate
exponential family models, we present an approximate algorithm for finding the
optimal teaching set. Our algorithm optimizes the aggregate sufficient
statistics, then unpacks them into actual teaching examples. We give several
examples to illustrate our framework."
"The work presented in this paper is part of a global framework which long
term goal is to design a wireless sensor network able to support the
observation of a population of endangered birds. We present the first stage for
which we have conducted a knowledge discovery approach on a sample of
acoustical data. We use MFCC features extracted from bird songs and we exploit
two knowledge discovery techniques. One that relies on clustering-based
approaches, that highlights the homogeneity in the songs of the species. The
other, based on predictive modeling, that demonstrates the good performances of
various machine learning techniques for the identification process. The
knowledge elicited provides promising results to consider a widespread study
and to elicit guidelines for designing a first version of the automatic
approach for data collection based on acoustic sensors."
"The feature space (including both input and output variables) characterises a
data mining problem. In predictive (supervised) problems, the quality and
availability of features determines the predictability of the dependent
variable, and the performance of data mining models in terms of
misclassification or regression error. Good features, however, are usually
difficult to obtain. It is usual that many instances come with missing values,
either because the actual value for a given attribute was not available or
because it was too expensive. This is usually interpreted as a utility or
cost-sensitive learning dilemma, in this case between misclassification (or
regression error) costs and attribute tests costs. Both misclassification cost
(MC) and test cost (TC) can be integrated into a single measure, known as joint
cost (JC). We introduce methods and plots (such as the so-called JROC plots)
that can work with any of-the-shelf predictive technique, including ensembles,
such that we re-frame the model to use the appropriate subset of attributes
(the feature configuration) during deployment time. In other words, models are
trained with the available attributes (once and for all) and then deployed by
setting missing values on the attributes that are deemed ineffective for
reducing the joint cost. As the number of feature configuration combinations
grows exponentially with the number of features we introduce quadratic methods
that are able to approximate the optimal configuration and model choices, as
shown by the experimental results."
"We study the sample complexity of multiclass prediction in several learning
settings. For the PAC setting our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: In
sharp contrast to binary classification, we show that there exist multiclass
hypothesis classes for which some Empirical Risk Minimizers (ERM learners) have
lower sample complexity than others. Furthermore, there are classes that are
learnable by some ERM learners, while other ERM learners will fail to learn
them. We propose a principle for designing good ERM learners, and use this
principle to prove tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning {\em
symmetric} multiclass hypothesis classes---classes that are invariant under
permutations of label names. We further provide a characterization of mistake
and regret bounds for multiclass learning in the online setting and the bandit
setting, using new generalizations of Littlestone's dimension."
"Stochastic neurons and hard non-linearities can be useful for a number of
reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging
problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the
input of such stochastic or non-smooth neurons? I.e., can we ""back-propagate""
through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing
approaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different
settings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for
stochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second
approach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic
neuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which
approximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first
order. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative
noise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth
approach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic
output directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid
argument (we call this the straight-through estimator). To explore a context
where these estimators are useful, we consider a small-scale version of {\em
conditional computation}, where sparse stochastic units form a distributed
representation of gaters that can turn off in combinatorially many ways large
chunks of the computation performed in the rest of the neural network. In this
case, it is important that the gating units produce an actual 0 most of the
time. The resulting sparsity can be potentially be exploited to greatly reduce
the computational cost of large deep networks for which conditional computation
would be useful."
"It has been found that stochastic algorithms often find good solutions much
more rapidly than inherently-batch approaches. Indeed, a very useful rule of
thumb is that often, when solving a machine learning problem, an iterative
technique which relies on performing a very large number of
relatively-inexpensive updates will often outperform one which performs a
smaller number of much ""smarter"" but computationally-expensive updates.
  In this thesis, we will consider the application of stochastic algorithms to
two of the most important machine learning problems. Part i is concerned with
the supervised problem of binary classification using kernelized linear
classifiers, for which the data have labels belonging to exactly two classes
(e.g. ""has cancer"" or ""doesn't have cancer""), and the learning problem is to
find a linear classifier which is best at predicting the label. In Part ii, we
will consider the unsupervised problem of Principal Component Analysis, for
which the learning task is to find the directions which contain most of the
variance of the data distribution.
  Our goal is to present stochastic algorithms for both problems which are,
above all, practical--they work well on real-world data, in some cases better
than all known competing algorithms. A secondary, but still very important,
goal is to derive theoretical bounds on the performance of these algorithms
which are at least competitive with, and often better than, those known for
other approaches."
"We study the problem of predicting a set or list of options under knapsack
constraint. The quality of such lists are evaluated by a submodular reward
function that measures both quality and diversity. Similar to DAgger (Ross et
al., 2010), by a reduction to online learning, we show how to adapt two
sequence prediction models to imitate greedy maximization under knapsack
constraint problems: CONSEQOPT (Dey et al., 2012) and SCP (Ross et al., 2013).
Experiments on extractive multi-document summarization show that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
"This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and
regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning
Research, vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) [arXiv:0803.3490] by H. Xu, etc. They
proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the
feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we
propose a counter example that rejects their theorem."
"We present a new algorithm for general reinforcement learning where the true
environment is known to belong to a finite class of N arbitrary models. The
algorithm is shown to be near-optimal for all but O(N log^2 N) time-steps with
high probability. Infinite classes are also considered where we show that
compactness is a key criterion for determining the existence of uniform
sample-complexity bounds. A matching lower bound is given for the finite case."
"We present an efficient distributed online learning scheme to classify data
captured from distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic data sources. Our scheme
consists of multiple distributed local learners, that analyze different streams
of data that are correlated to a common event that needs to be classified. Each
learner uses a local classifier to make a local prediction. The local
predictions are then collected by each learner and combined using a weighted
majority rule to output the final prediction. We propose a novel online
ensemble learning algorithm to update the aggregation rule in order to adapt to
the underlying data dynamics. We rigorously determine a bound for the worst
case misclassification probability of our algorithm which depends on the
misclassification probabilities of the best static aggregation rule, and of the
best local classifier. Importantly, the worst case misclassification
probability of our algorithm tends asymptotically to 0 if the misclassification
probability of the best static aggregation rule or the misclassification
probability of the best local classifier tend to 0. Then we extend our
algorithm to address challenges specific to the distributed implementation and
we prove new bounds that apply to these settings. Finally, we test our scheme
by performing an evaluation study on several data sets. When applied to data
sets widely used by the literature dealing with dynamic data streams and
concept drift, our scheme exhibits performance gains ranging from 34% to 71%
with respect to state of the art solutions."
"In this paper, we apply Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine
(ClassRBM) to the problem of predicting breast cancer recurrence. According to
the Polish National Cancer Registry, in 2010 only, the breast cancer caused
almost 25% of all diagnosed cases of cancer in Poland. We propose how to use
ClassRBM for predicting breast cancer return and discovering relevant inputs
(symptoms) in illness reappearance. Next, we outline a general probabilistic
framework for learning Boltzmann machines with masks, which we refer to as
Dropping. The fashion of generating masks leads to different learning methods,
i.e., DropOut, DropConnect. We propose a new method called DropPart which is a
generalization of DropConnect. In DropPart the Beta distribution instead of
Bernoulli distribution in DropConnect is used. At the end, we carry out an
experiment using real-life dataset consisting of 949 cases, provided by the
Institute of Oncology Ljubljana."
"Pattern recognition techniques have been employed in a myriad of industrial,
medical, commercial and academic applications. To tackle such a diversity of
data, many techniques have been devised. However, despite the long tradition of
pattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best
classification in all scenarios. Therefore, the consideration of as many as
possible techniques presents itself as an fundamental practice in applications
aiming at high accuracy. Typical works comparing methods either emphasize the
performance of a given algorithm in validation tests or systematically compare
various algorithms, assuming that the practical use of these methods is done by
experts. In many occasions, however, researchers have to deal with their
practical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the
underlying mechanisms behind parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of
classifiers and parameters alike in such practical circumstances constitutes a
long-standing problem and is the subject of the current paper. We carried out a
study on the performance of nine well-known classifiers implemented by the Weka
framework and compared the dependence of the accuracy with their configuration
parameter configurations. The analysis of performance with default parameters
revealed that the k-nearest neighbors method exceeds by a large margin the
other methods when high dimensional datasets are considered. When other
configuration of parameters were allowed, we found that it is possible to
improve the quality of SVM in more than 20% even if parameters are set
randomly. Taken together, the investigation conducted in this paper suggests
that, apart from the SVM implementation, Weka's default configuration of
parameters provides an performance close the one achieved with the optimal
configuration."
"We study exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits in a setting where $k$ players
collaborate in order to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal arm. Our motivation
comes from recent employment of bandit algorithms in computationally intensive,
large-scale applications. Our results demonstrate a non-trivial tradeoff
between the number of arm pulls required by each of the players, and the amount
of communication between them. In particular, our main result shows that by
allowing the $k$ players to communicate only once, they are able to learn
$\sqrt{k}$ times faster than a single player. That is, distributing learning to
$k$ players gives rise to a factor $\sqrt{k}$ parallel speed-up. We complement
this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible. On
the other extreme, we present an algorithm that achieves the ideal factor $k$
speed-up in learning performance, with communication only logarithmic in
$1/\epsilon$."
"The kernel support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used
classification methods; however, the amount of computation required becomes the
bottleneck when facing millions of samples. In this paper, we propose and
analyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the
division step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by
clustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and
efficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the
subproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM
problem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel
clustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are
used to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly
as suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel
Divide-and-Conquer SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction
strategy, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training
speed, testing accuracy, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype
dataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in
obtaining the exact SVM solution (to within $10^{-6}$ relative error) which
achieves 96.15% prediction accuracy. Moreover, with our proposed early
prediction strategy, DC-SVM achieves about 96% accuracy in only 12 minutes,
which is more than 100 times faster than LIBSVM."
"Support vector machine (SVM) has been one of the most popular learning
algorithms, with the central idea of maximizing the minimum margin, i.e., the
smallest distance from the instances to the classification boundary. Recent
theoretical results, however, disclosed that maximizing the minimum margin does
not necessarily lead to better generalization performances, and instead, the
margin distribution has been proven to be more crucial. In this paper, we
propose the Large margin Distribution Machine (LDM), which tries to achieve a
better generalization performance by optimizing the margin distribution. We
characterize the margin distribution by the first- and second-order statistics,
i.e., the margin mean and variance. The LDM is a general learning approach
which can be used in any place where SVM can be applied, and its superiority is
verified both theoretically and empirically in this paper."
"It is surprising that last two decades many works in time series data mining
and clustering were concerned with measures of similarity of time series but
not with measures of association that can be used for measuring possible direct
and inverse relationships between time series. Inverse relationships can exist
between dynamics of prices and sell volumes, between growth patterns of
competitive companies, between well production data in oilfields, between wind
velocity and air pollution concentration etc. The paper develops a theoretical
basis for analysis and construction of time series shape association measures.
Starting from the axioms of time series shape association measures it studies
the methods of construction of measures satisfying these axioms. Several
general methods of construction of such measures suitable for measuring time
series shape similarity and shape association are proposed. Time series shape
association measures based on Minkowski distance and data standardization
methods are considered. The cosine similarity and the Pearsons correlation
coefficient are obtained as particular cases of the proposed general methods
that can be used also for construction of new association measures in data
analysis."
"We derive a family of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods for
agents, who face sequential decision-making tasks in uncertain environments. By
applying a utility function to the temporal difference (TD) error, nonlinear
transformations are effectively applied not only to the received rewards but
also to the true transition probabilities of the underlying Markov decision
process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents' behaviors
express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), for example different risk-preferences for gains
and losses as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a
risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human
behavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence.
As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework we apply it
to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find, that the
risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral
data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses which is
indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured
fMRI signals show a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive TD error with
BOLD signal change in the ventral striatum. In addition we find a significant
correlation of the risk-sensitive Q-values with neural activity in the
striatum, cingulate cortex and insula, which is not present if standard
Q-values are used."
"We present an algorithm for minimizing a sum of functions that combines the
computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the second
order curvature information leveraged by quasi-Newton methods. We unify these
disparate approaches by maintaining an independent Hessian approximation for
each contributing function in the sum. We maintain computational tractability
and limit memory requirements even for high dimensional optimization problems
by storing and manipulating these quadratic approximations in a shared, time
evolving, low dimensional subspace. Each update step requires only a single
contributing function or minibatch evaluation (as in SGD), and each step is
scaled using an approximate inverse Hessian and little to no adjustment of
hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods). This
algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques that treat
the Hessian of each contributing function as a noisy approximation to the full
Hessian, rather than as a target for direct estimation. We experimentally
demonstrate improved convergence on seven diverse optimization problems. The
algorithm is released as open source Python and MATLAB packages."
"Missing value imputation is an important practical problem. There is a large
body of work on it, but there does not exist any work that formulates the
problem in a structured output setting. Also, most applications have
constraints on the imputed data, for example on the distribution associated
with each variable. None of the existing imputation methods use these
constraints. In this paper we propose a structured output approach for missing
value imputation that also incorporates domain constraints. We focus on large
margin models, but it is easy to extend the ideas to probabilistic models. We
deal with the intractable inference step in learning via a piecewise training
technique that is simple, efficient, and effective. Comparison with existing
state-of-the-art and baseline imputation methods shows that our method gives
significantly improved performance on the Hamming loss measure."
"In structured output learning, obtaining labelled data for real-world
applications is usually costly, while unlabelled examples are available in
abundance. Semi-supervised structured classification has been developed to
handle large amounts of unlabelled structured data. In this work, we consider
semi-supervised structural SVMs with domain constraints. The optimization
problem, which in general is not convex, contains the loss terms associated
with the labelled and unlabelled examples along with the domain constraints. We
propose a simple optimization approach, which alternates between solving a
supervised learning problem and a constraint matching problem. Solving the
constraint matching problem is difficult for structured prediction, and we
propose an efficient and effective hill-climbing method to solve it. The
alternating optimization is carried out within a deterministic annealing
framework, which helps in effective constraint matching, and avoiding local
minima which are not very useful. The algorithm is simple to implement and
achieves comparable generalization performance on benchmark datasets."
"The increased availability of data in recent years has led several authors to
ask whether it is possible to use data as a {\em computational} resource. That
is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it
possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to
perform the learning task?
  We give the first positive answer to this question for a {\em natural
supervised learning problem} --- we consider agnostic PAC learning of
halfspaces over $3$-sparse vectors in $\{-1,1,0\}^n$. This class is
inefficiently learnable using $O\left(n/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. Our main
contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing
computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely
believed assumption that refuting random $\mathrm{3CNF}$ formulas is hard, it
is impossible to efficiently learn this class using only
$O\left(n/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. We further show that under stronger
hardness assumptions, even $O\left(n^{1.499}/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples do not
suffice. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class
efficiently using $\tilde{\Omega}\left(n^2/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. This
formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity
for a natural supervised learning problem."
"We consider the problem of quantitatively evaluating missing value imputation
algorithms. Given a dataset with missing values and a choice of several
imputation algorithms to fill them in, there is currently no principled way to
rank the algorithms using a quantitative metric. We develop a framework based
on treating imputation evaluation as a problem of comparing two distributions
and show how it can be used to compute quantitative metrics. We present an
efficient procedure for applying this framework to practical datasets,
demonstrate several metrics derived from the existing literature on comparing
distributions, and propose a new metric called Neighborhood-based Dissimilarity
Score which is fast to compute and provides similar results. Results are shown
on several datasets, metrics, and imputations algorithms."
"The kernel $k$-means is an effective method for data clustering which extends
the commonly-used $k$-means algorithm to work on a similarity matrix over
complex data structures. The kernel $k$-means algorithm is however
computationally very complex as it requires the complete data matrix to be
calculated and stored. Further, the kernelized nature of the kernel $k$-means
algorithm hinders the parallelization of its computations on modern
infrastructures for distributed computing. In this paper, we are defining a
family of kernel-based low-dimensional embeddings that allows for scaling
kernel $k$-means on MapReduce via an efficient and unified parallelization
strategy. Afterwards, we propose two methods for low-dimensional embedding that
adhere to our definition of the embedding family. Exploiting the proposed
parallelization strategy, we present two scalable MapReduce algorithms for
kernel $k$-means. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed algorithms through an empirical evaluation on benchmark data sets."
"The task of assigning label sequences to a set of observed sequences is
common in computational linguistics. Several models for sequence labeling have
been proposed over the last few years. Here, we focus on discriminative models
for sequence labeling. Many batch and online (updating model parameters after
visiting each example) learning algorithms have been proposed in the
literature. On large datasets, online algorithms are preferred as batch
learning methods are slow. These online algorithms were designed to solve
either a primal or a dual problem. However, there has been no systematic
comparison of these algorithms in terms of their speed, generalization
performance (accuracy/likelihood) and their ability to achieve steady state
generalization performance fast. With this aim, we compare different algorithms
and make recommendations, useful for a practitioner. We conclude that the
selection of an algorithm for sequence labeling depends on the evaluation
criterion used and its implementation simplicity."
"Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a special type of the temporally deep network
model, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the recurrent matrix is
carefully designed and both the recurrent and input matrices are fixed. An ESN
uses the linearity of the activation function of the output units to simplify
the learning of the output matrix. In this paper, we devise a special technique
that take advantage of this linearity in the output units of an ESN, to learn
the input and recurrent matrices. This has not been done in earlier ESNs due to
their well known difficulty in learning those matrices. Compared to the
technique of BackPropagation Through Time (BPTT) in learning general RNNs, our
proposed method exploits linearity of activation function in the output units
to formulate the relationships amongst the various matrices in an RNN. These
relationships results in the gradient of the cost function having an analytical
form and being more accurate. This would enable us to compute the gradients
instead of obtaining them by recursion as in BPTT. Experimental results on
phone state classification show that learning one or both the input and
recurrent matrices in an ESN yields superior results compared to traditional
ESNs that do not learn these matrices, especially when longer time steps are
used."
"Many researches have been devoted to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric,
which can effectively improve the performance of kNN classification. Most
approaches are iterative and computational expensive and linear rigidity still
critically limits metric learning algorithm to perform better. We proposed a
computational economical framework to learn multiple metrics in closed-form."
"In this paper, we push forward the idea of machine learning systems whose
operators can be modified and fine-tuned for each problem. This allows us to
propose a learning paradigm where users can write (or adapt) their operators,
according to the problem, data representation and the way the information
should be navigated. To achieve this goal, data instances, background
knowledge, rules, programs and operators are all written in the same functional
language, Erlang. Since changing operators affect how the search space needs to
be explored, heuristics are learnt as a result of a decision process based on
reinforcement learning where each action is defined as a choice of operator and
rule. As a result, the architecture can be seen as a 'system for writing
machine learning systems' or to explore new operators where the policy reuse
(as a kind of transfer learning) is allowed. States and actions are represented
in a Q matrix which is actually a table, from which a supervised model is
learnt. This makes it possible to have a more flexible mapping between old and
new problems, since we work with an abstraction of rules and actions. We
include some examples sharing reuse and the application of the system gErl to
IQ problems. In order to evaluate gErl, we will test it against some structured
problems: a selection of IQ test tasks and some experiments on some structured
prediction problems (list patterns)."
"The covariate shift is a challenging problem in supervised learning that
results from the discrepancy between the training and test distributions. An
effective approach which recently drew a considerable attention in the research
community is to reweight the training samples to minimize that discrepancy. In
specific, many methods are based on developing Density-ratio (DR) estimation
techniques that apply to both regression and classification problems. Although
these methods work well for regression problems, their performance on
classification problems is not satisfactory. This is due to a key observation
that these methods focus on matching the sample marginal distributions without
paying attention to preserving the separation between classes in the reweighted
space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for Discriminative
Density-ratio (DDR) estimation that addresses the aforementioned problem and
aims at estimating the density-ratio of joint distributions in a class-wise
manner. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that alternates
between estimating the class information for the test data and estimating new
density ratio for each class. To incorporate the estimated class information of
the test data, a soft matching technique is proposed. In addition, we employ an
effective criterion which adopts mutual information as an indicator to stop the
iterative procedure while resulting in a decision boundary that lies in a
sparse region. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and robustness."
"A hierarchical clustering method is stable if small perturbations on the data
set produce small perturbations in the result. These perturbations are measured
using the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. We study the problem of stability on
linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods. We obtain that, under some basic
conditions, standard linkage-based methods are semi-stable. This means that
they are stable if the input data is close enough to an ultrametric space. We
prove that, apart from exotic examples, introducing any unchaining condition in
the algorithm always produces unstable methods."
"Feature selection plays a pivotal role in learning, particularly in areas
were parsimonious features can provide insight into the underlying process,
such as biology. Recent approaches for non-linear feature selection employing
greedy optimisation of Centred Kernel Target Alignment(KTA), while exhibiting
strong results in terms of generalisation accuracy and sparsity, can become
computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional datasets. We propose randSel,
a randomised feature selection algorithm, with attractive scaling properties.
Our theoretical analysis of randSel provides strong probabilistic guarantees
for the correct identification of relevant features. Experimental results on
real and artificial data, show that the method successfully identifies
effective features, performing better than a number of competitive approaches."
"Challenging optimization problems, which elude acceptable solution via
conventional calculus methods, arise commonly in different areas of industrial
design and practice. Hard optimization problems are those who manifest the
following behavior: a) high number of independent input variables; b) very
complex or irregular multi-modal fitness; c) computational expensive fitness
evaluation. This paper will focus on some theoretical issues that have strong
implications for practice. I will stress how an interpretation of the No Free
Lunch theorem leads naturally to a general Bayesian optimization framework. The
choice of a prior over the space of functions is a critical and inevitable step
in every black-box optimization."
"Several interesting generative learning algorithms involve a complex
probability distribution over many random variables, involving intractable
normalization constants or latent variable normalization. Some of them may even
not have an analytic expression for the unnormalized probability function and
no tractable approximation. This makes it difficult to estimate the quality of
these models, once they have been trained, or to monitor their quality (e.g.
for early stopping) while training. A previously proposed method is based on
constructing a non-parametric density estimator of the model's probability
function from samples generated by the model. We revisit this idea, propose a
more efficient estimator, and prove that it provides a lower bound on the true
test log-likelihood, and an unbiased estimator as the number of generated
samples goes to infinity, although one that incorporates the effect of poor
mixing. We further propose a biased variant of the estimator that can be used
reliably with a finite number of samples for the purpose of model comparison."
"Novelty detection plays an important role in machine learning and signal
processing. This paper studies novelty detection in a new setting where the
data object is represented as a bag of instances and associated with multiple
class labels, referred to as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning.
Contrary to the common assumption in MIML that each instance in a bag belongs
to one of the known classes, in novelty detection, we focus on the scenario
where bags may contain novel-class instances. The goal is to determine, for any
given instance in a new bag, whether it belongs to a known class or a novel
class. Detecting novelty in the MIML setting captures many real-world phenomena
and has many potential applications. For example, in a collection of tagged
images, the tag may only cover a subset of objects existing in the images.
Discovering an object whose class has not been previously tagged can be useful
for the purpose of soliciting a label for the new object class. To address this
novel problem, we present a discriminative framework for detecting new class
instances. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method,
and reveal that the presence of unlabeled novel instances in training bags is
helpful to the detection of such instances in testing stage."
"We study sequential prediction of real-valued, arbitrary and unknown
sequences under the squared error loss as well as the best parametric predictor
out of a large, continuous class of predictors. Inspired by recent results from
computational learning theory, we refrain from any statistical assumptions and
define the performance with respect to the class of general parametric
predictors. In particular, we present generic lower and upper bounds on this
relative performance by transforming the prediction task into a parameter
learning problem. We first introduce the lower bounds on this relative
performance in the mixture of experts framework, where we show that for any
sequential algorithm, there always exists a sequence for which the performance
of the sequential algorithm is lower bounded by zero. We then introduce a
sequential learning algorithm to predict such arbitrary and unknown sequences,
and calculate upper bounds on its total squared prediction error for every
bounded sequence. We further show that in some scenarios we achieve matching
lower and upper bounds demonstrating that our algorithms are optimal in a
strong minimax sense such that their performances cannot be improved further.
As an interesting result we also prove that for the worst case scenario, the
performance of randomized algorithms can be achieved by sequential algorithms
so that randomized algorithms does not improve the performance."
"We consider the problem of learning reject option classifiers. The goodness
of a reject option classifier is quantified using $0-d-1$ loss function wherein
a loss $d \in (0,.5)$ is assigned for rejection. In this paper, we propose {\em
double ramp loss} function which gives a continuous upper bound for $(0-d-1)$
loss. Our approach is based on minimizing regularized risk under the double
ramp loss using {\em difference of convex (DC) programming}. We show the
effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets. Our approach performs better than the state of the art reject option
classification approaches."
"We introduce a novel family of adaptive filtering algorithms based on a
relative logarithmic cost. The new family intrinsically combines the higher and
lower order measures of the error into a single continuous update based on the
error amount. We introduce important members of this family of algorithms such
as the least mean logarithmic square (LMLS) and least logarithmic absolute
difference (LLAD) algorithms that improve the convergence performance of the
conventional algorithms. However, our approach and analysis are generic such
that they cover other well-known cost functions as described in the paper. The
LMLS algorithm achieves comparable convergence performance with the least mean
fourth (LMF) algorithm and extends the stability bound on the step size. The
LLAD and least mean square (LMS) algorithms demonstrate similar convergence
performance in impulse-free noise environments while the LLAD algorithm is
robust against impulsive interferences and outperforms the sign algorithm (SA).
We analyze the transient, steady state and tracking performance of the
introduced algorithms and demonstrate the match of the theoretical analyzes and
simulation results. We show the extended stability bound of the LMLS algorithm
and analyze the robustness of the LLAD algorithm against impulsive
interferences. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in
different scenarios through numerical examples."
"TThe problem is to identify a probability associated with a set of natural
numbers, given an infinite data sequence of elements from the set. If the given
sequence is drawn i.i.d. and the probability mass function involved (the
target) belongs to a computably enumerable (c.e.) or co-computably enumerable
(co-c.e.) set of computable probability mass functions, then there is an
algorithm to almost surely identify the target in the limit. The technical tool
is the strong law of large numbers. If the set is finite and the elements of
the sequence are dependent while the sequence is typical in the sense of
Martin-L\""of for at least one measure belonging to a c.e. or co-c.e. set of
computable measures, then there is an algorithm to identify in the limit a
computable measure for which the sequence is typical (there may be more than
one such measure). The technical tool is the theory of Kolmogorov complexity.
We give the algorithms and consider the associated predictions."
"The ICDM Challenge 2013 is to apply machine learning to the problem of hotel
ranking, aiming to maximize purchases according to given hotel characteristics,
location attractiveness of hotels, user's aggregated purchase history and
competitive online travel agency information for each potential hotel choice.
This paper describes the solution of team ""binghsu & MLRush & BrickMover"". We
conduct simple feature engineering work and train different models by each
individual team member. Afterwards, we use listwise ensemble method to combine
each model's output. Besides describing effective model and features, we will
discuss about the lessons we learned while using deep learning in this
competition."
"In this paper, we first prove a high probability bound rather than an
expectation bound for stochastic optimization with smooth loss. Furthermore,
the existing analysis requires the knowledge of optimal classifier for tuning
the step size in order to achieve the desired bound. However, this information
is usually not accessible in advanced. We also propose a strategy to address
the limitation."
"Recent advances have made it feasible to apply the stochastic variational
paradigm to a collapsed representation of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
While the stochastic variational paradigm has successfully been applied to an
uncollapsed representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), no
attempts to apply this type of inference in a collapsed setting of
non-parametric topic modeling have been put forward so far. In this paper we
explore such a collapsed stochastic variational Bayes inference for the HDP.
The proposed online algorithm is easy to implement and accounts for the
inference of hyper-parameters. First experiments show a promising improvement
in predictive performance."
"We propose a novel approach for designing kernels for support vector machines
(SVMs) when the class label is linked to the observation through a latent state
and the likelihood function of the observation given the state (the sensing
model) is available. We show that the Bayes-optimum decision boundary is a
hyperplane under a mapping defined by the likelihood function. Combining this
with the maximum margin principle yields kernels for SVMs that leverage
knowledge of the sensing model in an optimal way. We derive the optimum kernel
for the bag-of-words (BoWs) sensing model and demonstrate its superior
performance over other kernels in document and image classification tasks.
These results indicate that such optimum sensing-aware kernel SVMs can match
the performance of rather sophisticated state-of-the-art approaches."
"Structured prediction plays a central role in machine learning applications
from computational biology to computer vision. These models require
significantly more computation than unstructured models, and, in many
applications, algorithms may need to make predictions within a computational
budget or in an anytime fashion. In this work we propose an anytime technique
for learning structured prediction that, at training time, incorporates both
structural elements and feature computation trade-offs that affect test-time
inference. We apply our technique to the challenging problem of scene
understanding in computer vision and demonstrate efficient and anytime
predictions that gradually improve towards state-of-the-art classification
performance as the allotted time increases."
"We consider the problem of image representation for the tasks of unsupervised
learning and semi-supervised learning. In those learning tasks, the raw image
vectors may not provide enough representation for their intrinsic structures
due to their highly dense feature space. To overcome this problem, the raw
image vectors should be mapped to a proper representation space which can
capture the latent structure of the original data and represent the data
explicitly for further learning tasks such as clustering.
  Inspired by the recent research works on deep neural network and
representation learning, in this paper, we introduce the multiple-layer
auto-encoder into image representation, we also apply the locally invariant
ideal to our image representation with auto-encoders and propose a novel
method, called Graph regularized Auto-Encoder (GAE). GAE can provide a compact
representation which uncovers the hidden semantics and simultaneously respects
the intrinsic geometric structure.
  Extensive experiments on image clustering show encouraging results of the
proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms on
real-word cases."
"Model interpretation is one of the key aspects of the model evaluation
process. The explanation of the relationship between model variables and
outputs is relatively easy for statistical models, such as linear regressions,
thanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical
significance. For ""black box"" models, such as random forest, this information
is hidden inside the model structure. This work presents an approach for
computing feature contributions for random forest classification models. It
allows for the determination of the influence of each variable on the model
prediction for an individual instance. By analysing feature contributions for a
training dataset, the most significant variables can be determined and their
typical contribution towards predictions made for individual classes, i.e.,
class-specific feature contribution ""patterns"", are discovered. These patterns
represent a standard behaviour of the model and allow for an additional
assessment of the model reliability for a new data. Interpretation of feature
contributions for two UCI benchmark datasets shows the potential of the
proposed methodology. The robustness of results is demonstrated through an
extensive analysis of feature contributions calculated for a large number of
generated random forest models."
"The permutahedron is the convex polytope with vertex set consisting of the
vectors $(\pi(1),\dots, \pi(n))$ for all permutations (bijections) $\pi$ over
$\{1,\dots, n\}$. We study a bandit game in which, at each step $t$, an
adversary chooses a hidden weight weight vector $s_t$, a player chooses a
vertex $\pi_t$ of the permutahedron and suffers an observed loss of
$\sum_{i=1}^n \pi(i) s_t(i)$.
  A previous algorithm CombBand of Cesa-Bianchi et al (2009) guarantees a
regret of $O(n\sqrt{T \log n})$ for a time horizon of $T$. Unfortunately,
CombBand requires at each step an $n$-by-$n$ matrix permanent approximation to
within improved accuracy as $T$ grows, resulting in a total running time that
is super linear in $T$, making it impractical for large time horizons.
  We provide an algorithm of regret $O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ with total time
complexity $O(n^3T)$. The ideas are a combination of CombBand and a recent
algorithm by Ailon (2013) for online optimization over the permutahedron in the
full information setting. The technical core is a bound on the variance of the
Plackett-Luce noisy sorting process's ""pseudo loss"". The bound is obtained by
establishing positive semi-definiteness of a family of 3-by-3 matrices
generated from rational functions of exponentials of 3 parameters."
"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have recently achieved the best performance
in off-line Handwriting Text Recognition. At the same time, learning RNN by
gradient descent leads to slow convergence, and training times are particularly
long when the training database consists of full lines of text. In this paper,
we propose an easy way to accelerate stochastic gradient descent in this
set-up, and in the general context of learning to recognize sequences. The
principle is called Curriculum Learning, or shaping. The idea is to first learn
to recognize short sequences before training on all available training
sequences. Experiments on three different handwritten text databases (Rimes,
IAM, OpenHaRT) show that a simple implementation of this strategy can
significantly speed up the training of RNN for Text Recognition, and even
significantly improve performance in some cases."
"A key challenge in designing convolutional network models is sizing them
appropriately. Many factors are involved in these decisions, including number
of layers, feature maps, kernel sizes, etc. Complicating this further is the
fact that each of these influence not only the numbers and dimensions of the
activation units, but also the total number of parameters. In this paper we
focus on assessing the independent contributions of three of these linked
variables: The numbers of layers, feature maps, and parameters. To accomplish
this, we employ a recursive convolutional network whose weights are tied
between layers; this allows us to vary each of the three factors in a
controlled setting. We find that while increasing the numbers of layers and
parameters each have clear benefit, the number of feature maps (and hence
dimensionality of the representation) appears ancillary, and finds most of its
benefit through the introduction of more weights. Our results (i) empirically
confirm the notion that adding layers alone increases computational power,
within the context of convolutional layers, and (ii) suggest that precise
sizing of convolutional feature map dimensions is itself of little concern;
more attention should be paid to the number of parameters in these layers
instead."
"In this paper we present a model for email authorship identification (EAI) by
employing a Cluster-based Classification (CCM) technique. Traditionally,
stylometric features have been successfully employed in various authorship
analysis tasks; we extend the traditional feature-set to include some more
interesting and effective features for email authorship identification (e.g.
the last punctuation mark used in an email, the tendency of an author to use
capitalization at the start of an email, or the punctuation after a greeting or
farewell). We also included Info Gain feature selection based content features.
It is observed that the use of such features in the authorship identification
process has a positive impact on the accuracy of the authorship identification
task. We performed experiments to justify our arguments and compared the
results with other base line models. Experimental results reveal that the
proposed CCM-based email authorship identification model, along with the
proposed feature set, outperforms the state-of-the-art support vector machine
(SVM)-based models, as well as the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]. The
proposed model attains an accuracy rate of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25
authors, and 81% for 50 authors, respectively on Enron dataset, while 89.5%
accuracy has been achieved on authors' constructed real email dataset. The
results on Enron dataset have been achieved on quite a large number of authors
as compared to the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]."
"In this paper we present two related, kernel-based Distance Metric Learning
(DML) methods. Their respective models non-linearly map data from their
original space to an output space, and subsequent distance measurements are
performed in the output space via a Mahalanobis metric. The dimensionality of
the output space can be directly controlled to facilitate the learning of a
low-rank metric. Both methods allow for simultaneous inference of the
associated metric and the mapping to the output space, which can be used to
visualize the data, when the output space is 2- or 3-dimensional. Experimental
results for a collection of classification tasks illustrate the advantages of
the proposed methods over other traditional and kernel-based DML approaches."
"This paper presents a RKHS, in general, of vector-valued functions intended
to be used as hypothesis space for multi-task classification. It extends
similar hypothesis spaces that have previously considered in the literature.
Assuming this space, an improved Empirical Rademacher Complexity-based
generalization bound is derived. The analysis is itself extended to an MKL
setting. The connection between the proposed hypothesis space and a Group-Lasso
type regularizer is discussed. Finally, experimental results, with some
SVM-based Multi-Task Learning problems, underline the quality of the derived
bounds and validate the paper's analysis."
"Regularized regression techniques for linear regression have been created the
last few ten years to reduce the flaws of ordinary least squares regression
with regard to prediction accuracy. In this paper, new methods for using
regularized regression in model choice are introduced, and we distinguish the
conditions in which regularized regression develops our ability to discriminate
models. We applied all the five methods that use penalty-based (regularization)
shrinkage to handle Oxazolines and Oxazoles derivatives descriptor dataset with
far more predictors than observations. The lasso, ridge, elasticnet, lars and
relaxed lasso further possess the desirable property that they simultaneously
select relevant predictive descriptors and optimally estimate their effects.
Here, we comparatively evaluate the performance of five regularized linear
regression methods The assessment of the performance of each model by means of
benchmark experiments is an established exercise. Cross-validation and
resampling methods are generally used to arrive point evaluates the
efficiencies which are compared to recognize methods with acceptable features.
Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and
Square of usual correlation between predictors and observed mean inhibitory
concentration of antitubercular activity (R square). We found that all five
regularized regression models were able to produce feasible models and
efficient capturing the linearity in the data. The elastic net and lars had
similar accuracies as well as lasso and relaxed lasso had similar accuracies
but outperformed ridge regression in terms of the RMSE and R square metrics."
"We argue for the use of active learning methods for player modelling. In
active learning, the learning algorithm chooses where to sample the search
space so as to optimise learning progress. We hypothesise that player modelling
based on active learning could result in vastly more efficient learning, but
will require big changes in how data is collected. Some example active player
modelling scenarios are described. A particular form of active learning is also
equivalent to an influential formalisation of (human and machine) curiosity,
and games with active learning could therefore be seen as being curious about
the player. We further hypothesise that this form of curiosity is symmetric,
and therefore that games that explore their players based on the principles of
active learning will turn out to select game configurations that are
interesting to the player that is being explored."
"Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is an effective framework for
performing max-margin online learning. But the deterministic formulation and
estimated single large-margin model could limit its capability in discovering
descriptive structures underlying complex data. This pa- per presents online
Bayesian Passive-Aggressive (BayesPA) learning, which subsumes the online PA
and extends naturally to incorporate latent variables and perform nonparametric
Bayesian inference, thus providing great flexibility for explorative analysis.
We apply BayesPA to topic modeling and derive efficient online learning
algorithms for max-margin topic models. We further develop nonparametric
methods to resolve the number of topics. Experimental results on real datasets
show that our approaches significantly improve time efficiency while
maintaining comparable results with the batch counterparts."
"This paper proposes a new method for the K-armed dueling bandit problem, a
variation on the regular K-armed bandit problem that offers only relative
feedback about pairs of arms. Our approach extends the Upper Confidence Bound
algorithm to the relative setting by using estimates of the pairwise
probabilities to select a promising arm and applying Upper Confidence Bound
with the winner as a benchmark. We prove a finite-time regret bound of order
O(log t). In addition, our empirical results using real data from an
information retrieval application show that it greatly outperforms the state of
the art."
"Policy Gradient methods that explore directly in parameter space are among
the most effective and robust direct policy search methods and have drawn a lot
of attention lately. The basic method from this field, Policy Gradients with
Parameter-based Exploration, uses two samples that are symmetric around the
current hypothesis to circumvent misleading reward in \emph{asymmetrical}
reward distributed problems gathered with the usual baseline approach. The
exploration parameters are still updated by a baseline approach - leaving the
exploration prone to asymmetric reward distributions. In this paper we will
show how the exploration parameters can be sampled quasi symmetric despite
having limited instead of free parameters for exploration. We give a
transformation approximation to get quasi symmetric samples with respect to the
exploration without changing the overall sampling distribution. Finally we will
demonstrate that sampling symmetrically also for the exploration parameters is
superior in needs of samples and robustness than the original sampling
approach."
"In this article we propose feature graph architectures (FGA), which are deep
learning systems employing a structured initialisation and training method
based on a feature graph which facilitates improved generalisation performance
compared with a standard shallow architecture. The goal is to explore
alternative perspectives on the problem of deep network training. We evaluate
FGA performance for deep SVMs on some experimental datasets, and show how
generalisation and stability results may be derived for these models. We
describe the effect of permutations on the model accuracy, and give a criterion
for the optimal permutation in terms of feature correlations. The experimental
results show that the algorithm produces robust and significant test set
improvements over a standard shallow SVM training method for a range of
datasets. These gains are achieved with a moderate increase in time complexity."
"Mixtures of Experts combine the outputs of several ""expert"" networks, each of
which specializes in a different part of the input space. This is achieved by
training a ""gating"" network that maps each input to a distribution over the
experts. Such models show promise for building larger networks that are still
cheap to compute at test time, and more parallelizable at training time. In
this this work, we extend the Mixture of Experts to a stacked model, the Deep
Mixture of Experts, with multiple sets of gating and experts. This
exponentially increases the number of effective experts by associating each
input with a combination of experts at each layer, yet maintains a modest model
size. On a randomly translated version of the MNIST dataset, we find that the
Deep Mixture of Experts automatically learns to develop location-dependent
(""where"") experts at the first layer, and class-specific (""what"") experts at
the second layer. In addition, we see that the different combinations are in
use when the model is applied to a dataset of speech monophones. These
demonstrate effective use of all expert combinations."
"In this paper, we propose an extremely simple deep model for the unsupervised
nonlinear dimensionality reduction -- deep distributed random samplings, which
performs like a stack of unsupervised bootstrap aggregating. First, its network
structure is novel: each layer of the network is a group of mutually
independent $k$-centers clusterings. Second, its learning method is extremely
simple: the $k$ centers of each clustering are only $k$ randomly selected
examples from the training data; for small-scale data sets, the $k$ centers are
further randomly reconstructed by a simple cyclic-shift operation. Experimental
results on nonlinear dimensionality reduction show that the proposed method can
learn abstract representations on both large-scale and small-scale problems,
and meanwhile is much faster than deep neural networks on large-scale problems."
"Scalability properties of deep neural networks raise key research questions,
particularly as the problems considered become larger and more challenging.
This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced by Bengio,
et. al., where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating
units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the
weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the
pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using
rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden
unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as
its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural
networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results
using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network
demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to
the error introduced by the conditional computation process."
"Darwin's theory of evolution is considered to be one of the greatest
scientific gems in modern science. It not only gives us a description of how
living things evolve, but also shows how a population evolves through time and
also, why only the fittest individuals continue the generation forward. The
paper basically gives a high level analysis of the works of Valiant[1]. Though,
we know the mechanisms of evolution, but it seems that there does not exist any
strong quantitative and mathematical theory of the evolution of certain
mechanisms. What is defined exactly as the fitness of an individual, why is
that only certain individuals in a population tend to mutate, how computation
is done in finite time when we have exponentially many examples: there seems to
be a lot of questions which need to be answered. [1] basically treats Darwinian
theory as a form of computational learning theory, which calculates the net
fitness of the hypotheses and thus distinguishes functions and their classes
which could be evolvable using polynomial amount of resources. Evolution is
considered as a function of the environment and the previous evolutionary
stages that chooses the best hypothesis using learning techniques that makes
mutation possible and hence, gives a quantitative idea that why only the
fittest individuals tend to survive and have the power to mutate."
"Not all instances in a data set are equally beneficial for inferring a model
of the data. Some instances (such as outliers) are detrimental to inferring a
model of the data. Several machine learning techniques treat instances in a
data set differently during training such as curriculum learning, filtering,
and boosting. However, an automated method for determining how beneficial an
instance is for inferring a model of the data does not exist. In this paper, we
present an automated method that orders the instances in a data set by
complexity based on the their likelihood of being misclassified (instance
hardness). The underlying assumption of this method is that instances with a
high likelihood of being misclassified represent more complex concepts in a
data set. Ordering the instances in a data set allows a learning algorithm to
focus on the most beneficial instances and ignore the detrimental ones. We
compare ordering the instances in a data set in curriculum learning, filtering
and boosting. We find that ordering the instances significantly increases
classification accuracy and that filtering has the largest impact on
classification accuracy. On a set of 52 data sets, ordering the instances
increases the average accuracy from 81% to 84%."
"Bootstrapping is a useful technique for estimating the uncertainty of a
predictor, for example, confidence intervals for prediction. It is typically
used on small to moderate sized datasets, due to its high computation cost.
This work describes a highly scalable online bootstrapping strategy,
implemented inside Vowpal Wabbit, that is several times faster than traditional
strategies. Our experiments indicate that, in addition to providing a black
box-like method for estimating uncertainty, our implementation of online
bootstrapping may also help to train models with better prediction performance
due to model averaging."
"Neural networks have recently been proposed for multi-label classification
because they are able to capture and model label dependencies in the output
layer. In this work, we investigate limitations of BP-MLL, a neural network
(NN) architecture that aims at minimizing pairwise ranking error. Instead, we
propose to use a comparably simple NN approach with recently proposed learning
techniques for large-scale multi-label text classification tasks. In
particular, we show that BP-MLL's ranking loss minimization can be efficiently
and effectively replaced with the commonly used cross entropy error function,
and demonstrate that several advances in neural network training that have been
developed in the realm of deep learning can be effectively employed in this
setting. Our experimental results show that simple NN models equipped with
advanced techniques such as rectified linear units, dropout, and AdaGrad
perform as well as or even outperform state-of-the-art approaches on six
large-scale textual datasets with diverse characteristics."
"We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control
policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement
learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant
of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function
estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from
the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or
learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six
of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them."
"Several recent publications have proposed methods for mapping images into
continuous semantic embedding spaces. In some cases the embedding space is
trained jointly with the image transformation. In other cases the semantic
embedding space is established by an independent natural language processing
task, and then the image transformation into that space is learned in a second
stage. Proponents of these image embedding systems have stressed their
advantages over the traditional \nway{} classification framing of image
understanding, particularly in terms of the promise for zero-shot learning --
the ability to correctly annotate images of previously unseen object
categories. In this paper, we propose a simple method for constructing an image
embedding system from any existing \nway{} image classifier and a semantic word
embedding model, which contains the $\n$ class labels in its vocabulary. Our
method maps images into the semantic embedding space via convex combination of
the class label embedding vectors, and requires no additional training. We show
that this simple and direct method confers many of the advantages associated
with more complex image embedding schemes, and indeed outperforms state of the
art methods on the ImageNet zero-shot learning task."
"Recently, it has been observed that when representations are learnt in a way
that encourages sparsity, improved performance is obtained on classification
tasks. These methods involve combinations of activation functions, sampling
steps and different kinds of penalties. To investigate the effectiveness of
sparsity by itself, we propose the k-sparse autoencoder, which is an
autoencoder with linear activation function, where in hidden layers only the k
highest activities are kept. When applied to the MNIST and NORB datasets, we
find that this method achieves better classification results than denoising
autoencoders, networks trained with dropout, and RBMs. k-sparse autoencoders
are simple to train and the encoding stage is very fast, making them
well-suited to large problem sizes, where conventional sparse coding algorithms
cannot be applied."
"Recent non-linear feature selection approaches employing greedy optimisation
of Centred Kernel Target Alignment(KTA) exhibit strong results in terms of
generalisation accuracy and sparsity. However, they are computationally
prohibitive for large datasets. We propose randSel, a randomised feature
selection algorithm, with attractive scaling properties. Our theoretical
analysis of randSel provides strong probabilistic guarantees for correct
identification of relevant features. RandSel's characteristics make it an ideal
candidate for identifying informative learned representations. We've conducted
experimentation to establish the performance of this approach, and present
encouraging results, including a 3rd position result in the recent ICML black
box learning challenge as well as competitive results for signal peptide
prediction, an important problem in bioinformatics."
"We present new initialization methods for the expectation-maximization
algorithm for multivariate Gaussian mixture models. Our methods are adaptions
of the well-known $K$-means++ initialization and the Gonzalez algorithm.
Thereby we aim to close the gap between simple random, e.g. uniform, and
complex methods, that crucially depend on the right choice of hyperparameters.
Our extensive experiments indicate the usefulness of our methods compared to
common techniques and methods, which e.g. apply the original $K$-means++ and
Gonzalez directly, with respect to artificial as well as real-world data sets."
"We propose to deal with sequential processes where only partial observations
are available by learning a latent representation space on which policies may
be accurately learned."
"Optimization by stochastic gradient descent is an important component of many
large-scale machine learning algorithms. A wide variety of such optimization
algorithms have been devised; however, it is unclear whether these algorithms
are robust and widely applicable across many different optimization landscapes.
In this paper we develop a collection of unit tests for stochastic
optimization. Each unit test rapidly evaluates an optimization algorithm on a
small-scale, isolated, and well-understood difficulty, rather than in
real-world scenarios where many such issues are entangled. Passing these unit
tests is not sufficient, but absolutely necessary for any algorithms with
claims to generality or robustness. We give initial quantitative and
qualitative results on numerous established algorithms. The testing framework
is open-source, extensible, and easy to apply to new algorithms."
"Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are general unsupervised learning
devices to ascertain generative models of data distributions. RBMs are often
trained using the Contrastive Divergence learning algorithm (CD), an
approximation to the gradient of the data log-likelihood. A simple
reconstruction error is often used to decide whether the approximation provided
by the CD algorithm is good enough, though several authors (Schulz et al.,
2010; Fischer & Igel, 2010) have raised doubts concerning the feasibility of
this procedure. However, not many alternatives to the reconstruction error have
been used in the literature. In this manuscript we investigate simple
alternatives to the reconstruction error in order to detect as soon as possible
the decrease in the log-likelihood during learning."
"Within the framework of AdaBoost.MH, we propose to train vector-valued
decision trees to optimize the multi-class edge without reducing the
multi-class problem to $K$ binary one-against-all classifications. The key
element of the method is a vector-valued decision stump, factorized into an
input-independent vector of length $K$ and label-independent scalar classifier.
At inner tree nodes, the label-dependent vector is discarded and the binary
classifier can be used for partitioning the input space into two regions. The
algorithm retains the conceptual elegance, power, and computational efficiency
of binary AdaBoost. In experiments it is on par with support vector machines
and with the best existing multi-class boosting algorithm AOSOLogitBoost, and
it is significantly better than other known implementations of AdaBoost.MH."
"Comparison of three kind of the clustering and find cost function and loss
function and calculate them. Error rate of the clustering methods and how to
calculate the error percentage always be one on the important factor for
evaluating the clustering methods, so this paper introduce one way to calculate
the error rate of clustering methods. Clustering algorithms can be divided into
several categories including partitioning clustering algorithms, hierarchical
algorithms and density based algorithms. Generally speaking we should compare
clustering algorithms by Scalability, Ability to work with different attribute,
Clusters formed by conventional, Having minimal knowledge of the computer to
recognize the input parameters, Classes for dealing with noise and extra
deposition that same error rate for clustering a new data, Thus, there is no
effect on the input data, different dimensions of high levels, K-means is one
of the simplest approach to clustering that clustering is an unsupervised
problem."
"Transfer Learning is concerned with the application of knowledge gained from
solving a problem to a different but related problem domain. In this paper, we
propose a method and efficient algorithm for ranking and selecting
representations from a Restricted Boltzmann Machine trained on a source domain
to be transferred onto a target domain. Experiments carried out using the
MNIST, ICDAR and TiCC image datasets show that the proposed adaptive feature
ranking and transfer learning method offers statistically significant
improvements on the training of RBMs. Our method is general in that the
knowledge chosen by the ranking function does not depend on its relation to any
specific target domain, and it works with unsupervised learning and
knowledge-based transfer."
"Learning probabilistic models over strings is an important issue for many
applications. Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of
inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings
drawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular
value decomposition of a matrix $H_S$, called the Hankel matrix, that records
the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned
distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $H_S$ and
on the distance between $H_S$ and its mean $H_r$. Existing concentration bounds
seem to indicate that the concentration over $H_r$ gets looser with the size of
$H_r$, suggesting to make a trade-off between the quantity of used information
and the size of $H_r$. We propose new dimension-free concentration bounds for
several variants of Hankel matrices. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds
are tight and that they significantly improve existing bounds. These results
suggest that the concentration rate of the Hankel matrix around its mean does
not constitute an argument for limiting its size."
"Time-series classification is an important domain of machine learning and a
plethora of methods have been developed for the task. In comparison to existing
approaches, this study presents a novel method which decomposes a time-series
dataset into latent patterns and membership weights of local segments to those
patterns. The process is formalized as a constrained objective function and a
tailored stochastic coordinate descent optimization is applied. The time-series
are projected to a new feature representation consisting of the sums of the
membership weights, which captures frequencies of local patterns. Features from
various sliding window sizes are concatenated in order to encapsulate the
interaction of patterns from different sizes. Finally, a large-scale
experimental comparison against 6 state of the art baselines and 43 real life
datasets is conducted. The proposed method outperforms all the baselines with
statistically significant margins in terms of prediction accuracy."
"Transductive graph-based semi-supervised learning methods usually build an
undirected graph utilizing both labeled and unlabeled samples as vertices.
Those methods propagate label information of labeled samples to neighbors
through their edges in order to get the predicted labels of unlabeled samples.
Most popular semi-supervised learning approaches are sensitive to initial label
distribution happened in imbalanced labeled datasets. The class boundary will
be severely skewed by the majority classes in an imbalanced classification. In
this paper, we proposed a simple and effective approach to alleviate the
unfavorable influence of imbalance problem by iteratively selecting a few
unlabeled samples and adding them into the minority classes to form a balanced
labeled dataset for the learning methods afterwards. The experiments on UCI
datasets and MNIST handwritten digits dataset showed that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing state-of-art methods."
"A rekindled the interest in auto-encoder algorithms has been spurred by
recent work on deep learning. Current efforts have been directed towards
effective training of auto-encoder architectures with a large number of coding
units. Here, we propose a learning algorithm for auto-encoders based on a
rate-distortion objective that minimizes the mutual information between the
inputs and the outputs of the auto-encoder subject to a fidelity constraint.
The goal is to learn a representation that is minimally committed to the input
data, but that is rich enough to reconstruct the inputs up to certain level of
distortion. Minimizing the mutual information acts as a regularization term
whereas the fidelity constraint can be understood as a risk functional in the
conventional statistical learning setting. The proposed algorithm uses a
recently introduced measure of entropy based on infinitely divisible matrices
that avoids the plug in estimation of densities. Experiments using
over-complete bases show that the rate-distortion auto-encoders can learn a
regularized input-output mapping in an implicit manner."
"Recently, we have proposed a maximum likelihood iterative algorithm for
estimation of the parameters of the Nakagami-m distribution. This technique
performs better than state of art estimation techniques for this distribution.
This could be of particular use in low data or block based estimation problems.
In these scenarios, the estimator should be able to give accurate estimates in
the mean square sense with less amounts of data. Also, the estimates should
improve with the increase in number of blocks received. In this paper, we see
through our simulations, that our proposal is well designed for such
requirements. Further, it is well known in the literature that an efficient
estimator does not exist for Nakagami-m distribution. In this paper, we derive
a theoretical expression for the variance of our proposed estimator. We find
that this expression clearly fits the experimental curve for the variance of
the proposed estimator. This expression is pretty close to the cramer-rao lower
bound(CRLB)."
"Many feature subset selection (FSS) algorithms have been proposed, but not
all of them are appropriate for a given feature selection problem. At the same
time, so far there is rarely a good way to choose appropriate FSS algorithms
for the problem at hand. Thus, FSS algorithm automatic recommendation is very
important and practically useful. In this paper, a meta learning based FSS
algorithm automatic recommendation method is presented. The proposed method
first identifies the data sets that are most similar to the one at hand by the
k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, and the distances among these data
sets are calculated based on the commonly-used data set characteristics. Then,
it ranks all the candidate FSS algorithms according to their performance on
these similar data sets, and chooses the algorithms with best performance as
the appropriate ones. The performance of the candidate FSS algorithms is
evaluated by a multi-criteria metric that takes into account not only the
classification accuracy over the selected features, but also the runtime of
feature selection and the number of selected features. The proposed
recommendation method is extensively tested on 115 real world data sets with 22
well-known and frequently-used different FSS algorithms for five representative
classifiers. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed FSS algorithm
recommendation method."
"In data analysis, latent variables play a central role because they help
provide powerful insights into a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from
biological to human sciences. The latent tree model, a particular type of
probabilistic graphical models, deserves attention. Its simple structure - a
tree - allows simple and efficient inference, while its latent variables
capture complex relationships. In the past decade, the latent tree model has
been subject to significant theoretical and methodological developments. In
this review, we propose a comprehensive study of this model. First we summarize
key ideas underlying the model. Second we explain how it can be efficiently
learned from data. Third we illustrate its use within three types of
applications: latent structure discovery, multidimensional clustering, and
probabilistic inference. Finally, we conclude and give promising directions for
future researches in this field."
"How should we present training examples to learners to teach them
classification rules? This is a natural problem when training workers for
crowdsourcing labeling tasks, and is also motivated by challenges in
data-driven online education. We propose a natural stochastic model of the
learners, modeling them as randomly switching among hypotheses based on
observed feedback. We then develop STRICT, an efficient algorithm for selecting
examples to teach to workers. Our solution greedily maximizes a submodular
surrogate objective function in order to select examples to show to the
learners. We prove that our strategy is competitive with the optimal teaching
policy. Moreover, for the special case of linear separators, we prove that an
exponential reduction in error probability can be achieved. Our experiments on
simulated workers as well as three real image annotation tasks on Amazon
Mechanical Turk show the effectiveness of our teaching algorithm."
"Deep generative models (DGMs) have brought about a major breakthrough, as
well as renewed interest, in generative latent variable models. However, an
issue current DGM formulations do not address concerns the data-driven
inference of the number of latent features needed to represent the observed
data. Traditional linear formulations allow for addressing this issue by
resorting to tools from the field of nonparametric statistics: Indeed,
nonparametric linear latent variable models, obtained by appropriate imposition
of Indian Buffet Process (IBP) priors, have been extensively studied by the
machine learning community; inference for such models can been performed either
via exact sampling or via approximate variational techniques. Based on this
inspiration, in this paper we examine whether similar ideas from the field of
Bayesian nonparametrics can be utilized in the context of modern DGMs in order
to address the latent variable dimensionality inference problem. To this end,
we propose a novel DGM formulation, based on the imposition of an IBP prior. We
devise an efficient Black-Box Variational inference algorithm for our model,
and exhibit its efficacy in a number of semi-supervised classification
experiments. In all cases, we use popular benchmark datasets, and compare to
state-of-the-art DGMs."
"Let $f:\{-1,1\}^n$ be a polynomial with at most $s$ non-zero real
coefficients. We give an algorithm for exactly reconstructing f given random
examples from the uniform distribution on $\{-1,1\}^n$ that runs in time
polynomial in $n$ and $2s$ and succeeds if the function satisfies the unique
sign property: there is one output value which corresponds to a unique set of
values of the participating parities. This sufficient condition is satisfied
when every coefficient of f is perturbed by a small random noise, or satisfied
with high probability when s parity functions are chosen randomly or when all
the coefficients are positive. Learning sparse polynomials over the Boolean
domain in time polynomial in $n$ and $2s$ is considered notoriously hard in the
worst-case. Our result shows that the problem is tractable for almost all
sparse polynomials. Then, we show an application of this result to hypergraph
sketching which is the problem of learning a sparse (both in the number of
hyperedges and the size of the hyperedges) hypergraph from uniformly drawn
random cuts. We also provide experimental results on a real world dataset."
"Recently there has been much work on selective sampling, an online active
learning setting, in which algorithms work in rounds. On each round an
algorithm receives an input and makes a prediction. Then, it can decide whether
to query a label, and if so to update its model, otherwise the input is
discarded. Most of this work is focused on the stationary case, where it is
assumed that there is a fixed target model, and the performance of the
algorithm is compared to a fixed model. However, in many real-world
applications, such as spam prediction, the best target function may drift over
time, or have shifts from time to time. We develop a novel selective sampling
algorithm for the drifting setting, analyze it under no assumptions on the
mechanism generating the sequence of instances, and derive new mistake bounds
that depend on the amount of drift in the problem. Simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms as a
selective sampling algorithm in the drifting setting."
"In the election of a hierarchical clustering method, theoretic properties may
give some insight to determine which method is the most suitable to treat a
clustering problem. Herein, we study some basic properties of two hierarchical
clustering methods: $\alpha$-unchaining single linkage or $SL(\alpha)$ and a
modified version of this one, $SL^*(\alpha)$. We compare the results with the
properties satisfied by the classical linkage-based hierarchical clustering
methods."
"We present a new probabilistic model of compact commutative Lie groups that
produces invariant-equivariant and disentangled representations of data. To
define the notion of disentangling, we borrow a fundamental principle from
physics that is used to derive the elementary particles of a system from its
symmetries. Our model employs a newfound Bayesian conjugacy relation that
enables fully tractable probabilistic inference over compact commutative Lie
groups -- a class that includes the groups that describe the rotation and
cyclic translation of images. We train the model on pairs of transformed image
patches, and show that the learned invariant representation is highly effective
for classification."
"Semisupervised learning is a learning standard which deals with the study of
how computers and natural systems such as human beings acquire knowledge in the
presence of both labeled and unlabeled data. Semisupervised learning based
methods are preferred when compared to the supervised and unsupervised learning
because of the improved performance shown by the semisupervised approaches in
the presence of large volumes of data. Labels are very hard to attain while
unlabeled data are surplus, therefore semisupervised learning is a noble
indication to shrink human labor and improve accuracy. There has been a large
spectrum of ideas on semisupervised learning. In this paper we bring out some
of the key approaches for semisupervised learning."
"This paper adapts a recently developed regularized stochastic version of the
Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method for the
solution of support vector machine classification problems. The proposed method
is shown to converge almost surely to the optimal classifier at a rate that is
linear in expectation. Numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits
a convergence rate that degrades smoothly with the dimensionality of the
feature vectors."
"To achieve acceptable performance for AI tasks, one can either use
sophisticated feature extraction methods as the first layer in a two-layered
supervised learning model, or learn the features directly using a deep
(multi-layered) model. While the first approach is very problem-specific, the
second approach has computational overheads in learning multiple layers and
fine-tuning of the model. In this paper, we propose an approach called wide
learning based on arc-cosine kernels, that learns a single layer of infinite
width. We propose exact and inexact learning strategies for wide learning and
show that wide learning with single layer outperforms single layer as well as
deep architectures of finite width for some benchmark datasets."
"In this paper, we consider a very general model for exploration-exploitation
tradeoff which allows arbitrary concave rewards and convex constraints on the
decisions across time, in addition to the customary limitation on the time
horizon. This model subsumes the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, and
the Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) model of Badanidiyuru et al.[2013]. We also
consider an extension of this model to allow linear contexts, similar to the
linear contextual extension of the MAB model. We demonstrate that a natural and
simple extension of the UCB family of algorithms for MAB provides a polynomial
time algorithm that has near-optimal regret guarantees for this substantially
more general model, and matches the bounds provided by Badanidiyuru et
al.[2013] for the special case of BwK, which is quite surprising. We also
provide computationally more efficient algorithms by establishing interesting
connections between this problem and other well studied problems/algorithms
such as the Blackwell approachability problem, online convex optimization, and
the Frank-Wolfe technique for convex optimization. We give examples of several
concrete applications, where this more general model of bandits allows for
richer and/or more efficient formulations of the problem."
"The objective of the GreenPAD project is to use green energy (wind, solar and
biomass) for powering data-centers that are used to run HPC jobs. As a part of
this it is important to predict the Renewable (Wind) energy for efficient
scheduling (executing jobs that require higher energy when there is more green
energy available and vice-versa). For predicting the wind energy we first
analyze the historical data to find a statistical model that gives relation
between wind energy and weather attributes. Then we use this model based on the
weather forecast data to predict the green energy availability in the future.
Using the green energy prediction obtained from the statistical model we are
able to precompute job schedules for maximizing the green energy utilization in
the future. We propose a model which uses live weather data in addition to
machine learning techniques (which can predict future deviations in weather
conditions based on current deviations from the forecast) to make on-the-fly
changes to the precomputed schedule (based on green energy prediction).
  For this we first analyze the data using histograms and simple statistical
tools such as correlation. In addition we build (correlation) regression model
for finding the relation between wind energy availability and weather
attributes (temperature, cloud cover, air pressure, wind speed / direction,
precipitation and sunshine). We also analyze different algorithms and machine
learning techniques for optimizing the job schedules for maximizing the green
energy utilization."
"The goal of machine learning is to develop predictors that generalize well to
test data. Ideally, this is achieved by training on an almost infinitely large
training data set that captures all variations in the data distribution. In
practical learning settings, however, we do not have infinite data and our
predictors may overfit. Overfitting may be combatted, for example, by adding a
regularizer to the training objective or by defining a prior over the model
parameters and performing Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a
third, alternative approach to combat overfitting: we extend the training set
with infinitely many artificial training examples that are obtained by
corrupting the original training data. We show that this approach is practical
and efficient for a range of predictors and corruption models. Our approach,
called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), trains robust predictors by
minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corruption model.
We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be
trained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are
also more robust to feature deletion at test time."
"When dealing with datasets containing a billion instances or with simulations
that require a supercomputer to execute, computational resources become part of
the equation. We can improve the efficiency of learning and inference by
exploiting their inherent statistical nature. We propose algorithms that
exploit the redundancy of data relative to a model by subsampling data-cases
for every update and reasoning about the uncertainty created in this process.
In the context of learning we propose to test for the probability that a
stochastically estimated gradient points more than 180 degrees in the wrong
direction. In the context of MCMC sampling we use stochastic gradients to
improve the efficiency of MCMC updates, and hypothesis tests based on adaptive
mini-batches to decide whether to accept or reject a proposed parameter update.
Finally, we argue that in the context of likelihood free MCMC one needs to
store all the information revealed by all simulations, for instance in a
Gaussian process. We conclude that Bayesian methods will remain to play a
crucial role in the era of big data and big simulations, but only if we
overcome a number of computational challenges."
"We introduce a new problem, the Online Selective Anomaly Detection (OSAD), to
model a specific scenario emerging from research in sleep science. Scientists
have segmented sleep into several stages and stage two is characterized by two
patterns (or anomalies) in the EEG time series recorded on sleep subjects.
These two patterns are sleep spindle (SS) and K-complex. The OSAD problem was
introduced to design a residual system, where all anomalies (known and unknown)
are detected but the system only triggers an alarm when non-SS anomalies
appear. The solution of the OSAD problem required us to combine techniques from
both machine learning and control theory. Experiments on data from real
subjects attest to the effectiveness of our approach."
"A commonly used paradigm for representing graphs is to use a vector that
contains normalized frequencies of occurrence of certain motifs or sub-graphs.
This vector representation can be used in a variety of applications, such as,
for computing similarity between graphs. The graphlet kernel of Shervashidze et
al. [32] uses induced sub-graphs of k nodes (christened as graphlets by Przulj
[28]) as motifs in the vector representation, and computes the kernel via a dot
product between these vectors. One can easily show that this is a valid kernel
between graphs. However, such a vector representation suffers from a few
drawbacks. As k becomes larger we encounter the sparsity problem; most higher
order graphlets will not occur in a given graph. This leads to diagonal
dominance, that is, a given graph is similar to itself but not to any other
graph in the dataset. On the other hand, since lower order graphlets tend to be
more numerous, using lower values of k does not provide enough discrimination
ability. We propose a smoothing technique to tackle the above problems. Our
method is based on a novel extension of Kneser-Ney and Pitman-Yor smoothing
techniques from natural language processing to graphs. We use the relationships
between lower order and higher order graphlets in order to derive our method.
Consequently, our smoothing algorithm not only respects the dependency between
sub-graphs but also tackles the diagonal dominance problem by distributing the
probability mass across graphlets. In our experiments, the smoothed graphlet
kernel outperforms graph kernels based on raw frequency counts."
"We study algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert spaces,
focusing on the case where the player is unconstrained. We develop a novel
characterization of a large class of minimax algorithms, recovering, and even
improving, several previous results as immediate corollaries. Moreover, using
our tools, we develop an algorithm that provides a regret bound of
$\mathcal{O}\Big(U \sqrt{T \log(U \sqrt{T} \log^2 T +1)}\Big)$, where $U$ is
the $L_2$ norm of an arbitrary comparator and both $T$ and $U$ are unknown to
the player. This bound is optimal up to $\sqrt{\log \log T}$ terms. When $T$ is
known, we derive an algorithm with an optimal regret bound (up to constant
factors). For both the known and unknown $T$ case, a Normal approximation to
the conditional value of the game proves to be the key analysis tool."
"In this paper we present methods for exemplar based clustering with outlier
selection based on the facility location formulation. Given a distance function
and the number of outliers to be found, the methods automatically determine the
number of clusters and outliers. We formulate the problem as an integer program
to which we present relaxations that allow for solutions that scale to large
data sets. The advantages of combining clustering and outlier selection
include: (i) the resulting clusters tend to be compact and semantically
coherent (ii) the clusters are more robust against data perturbations and (iii)
the outliers are contextualised by the clusters and more interpretable, i.e. it
is easier to distinguish between outliers which are the result of data errors
from those that may be indicative of a new pattern emergent in the data. We
present and contrast three relaxations to the integer program formulation: (i)
a linear programming formulation (LP) (ii) an extension of affinity propagation
to outlier detection (APOC) and (iii) a Lagrangian duality based formulation
(LD). Evaluation on synthetic as well as real data shows the quality and
scalability of these different methods."
"In the past few years co-clustering has emerged as an important data mining
tool for two way data analysis. Co-clustering is more advantageous over
traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to find
highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the
overlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract
meaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For
example, building predictive models with high dimensional data and
heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such
data, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more
accurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding
patient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in
recommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from
co-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to
generate co-clusters for improved data analysis.
  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping
Co-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and
improved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by
maximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on
the number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and
f-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.
Results of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques
- K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia,
Internet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results demonstrate
the effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice."
"In recent years the importance of finding a meaningful pattern from huge
datasets has become more challenging. Data miners try to adopt innovative
methods to face this problem by applying feature selection methods. In this
paper we propose a new hybrid method in which we use a combination of
resampling, filtering the sample domain and wrapper subset evaluation method
with genetic search to reduce dimensions of Lung-Cancer dataset that we
received from UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases. Finally, we apply
some well- known classification algorithms (Na\""ive Bayes, Logistic, Multilayer
Perceptron, Best First Decision Tree and JRIP) to the resulting dataset and
compare the results and prediction rates before and after the application of
our feature selection method on that dataset. The results show a substantial
progress in the average performance of five classification algorithms
simultaneously and the classification error for these classifiers decreases
considerably. The experiments also show that this method outperforms other
feature selection methods with a lower cost."
"Cluster analysis has attracted more and more attention in the field of
machine learning and data mining. Numerous clustering algorithms have been
proposed and are being developed due to diverse theories and various
requirements of emerging applications. Therefore, it is very worth establishing
an unified axiomatic framework for data clustering. In the literature, it is an
open problem and has been proved very challenging. In this paper, clustering
results are axiomatized by assuming that an proper clustering result should
satisfy categorization axioms. The proposed axioms not only introduce
classification of clustering results and inequalities of clustering results,
but also are consistent with prototype theory and exemplar theory of
categorization models in cognitive science. Moreover, the proposed axioms lead
to three principles of designing clustering algorithm and cluster validity
index, which follow many popular clustering algorithms and cluster validity
indices."
"In this paper a hybrid feature selection method is proposed which takes
advantages of wrapper subset evaluation with a lower cost and improves the
performance of a group of classifiers. The method uses combination of sample
domain filtering and resampling to refine the sample domain and two feature
subset evaluation methods to select reliable features. This method utilizes
both feature space and sample domain in two phases. The first phase filters and
resamples the sample domain and the second phase adopts a hybrid procedure by
information gain, wrapper subset evaluation and genetic search to find the
optimal feature space. Experiments carried out on different types of datasets
from UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases and the results show a rise
in the average performance of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic,
Multilayer Perceptron, Best First Decision Tree and JRIP) simultaneously and
the classification error for these classifiers decreases considerably. The
experiments also show that this method outperforms other feature selection
methods with a lower cost."
"High accuracy in cancer prediction is important to improve the quality of the
treatment and to improve the rate of survivability of patients. As the data
volume is increasing rapidly in the healthcare research, the analytical
challenge exists in double. The use of effective sampling technique in
classification algorithms always yields good prediction accuracy. The SEER
public use cancer database provides various prominent class labels for
prognosis prediction. The main objective of this paper is to find the effect of
sampling techniques in classifying the prognosis variable and propose an ideal
sampling method based on the outcome of the experimentation. In the first phase
of this work the traditional random sampling and stratified sampling techniques
have been used. At the next level the balanced stratified sampling with
variations as per the choice of the prognosis class labels have been tested.
Much of the initial time has been focused on performing the pre_processing of
the SEER data set. The classification model for experimentation has been built
using the breast cancer, respiratory cancer and mixed cancer data sets with
three traditional classifiers namely Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest
Neighbor. The three prognosis factors survival, stage and metastasis have been
used as class labels for experimental comparisons. The results shows a steady
increase in the prediction accuracy of balanced stratified model as the sample
size increases, but the traditional approach fluctuates before the optimum
results."
"We present tools for the analysis of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL),
Dual Averaging, and Mirror Descent algorithms when the regularizer
(equivalently, prox-function or learning rate schedule) is chosen adaptively
based on the data. Adaptivity can be used to prove regret bounds that hold on
every round, and also allows for data-dependent regret bounds as in
AdaGrad-style algorithms (e.g., Online Gradient Descent with adaptive
per-coordinate learning rates). We present results from a large number of prior
works in a unified manner, using a modular and tight analysis that isolates the
key arguments in easily re-usable lemmas. This approach strengthens pre-viously
known FTRL analysis techniques to produce bounds as tight as those achieved by
potential functions or primal-dual analysis. Further, we prove a general and
exact equivalence between an arbitrary adaptive Mirror Descent algorithm and a
correspond- ing FTRL update, which allows us to analyze any Mirror Descent
algorithm in the same framework. The key to bridging the gap between Dual
Averaging and Mirror Descent algorithms lies in an analysis of the
FTRL-Proximal algorithm family. Our regret bounds are proved in the most
general form, holding for arbitrary norms and non-smooth regularizers with
time-varying weight."
"In many applications, the training data, from which one needs to learn a
classifier, is corrupted with label noise. Many standard algorithms such as SVM
perform poorly in presence of label noise. In this paper we investigate the
robustness of risk minimization to label noise. We prove a sufficient condition
on a loss function for the risk minimization under that loss to be tolerant to
uniform label noise. We show that the $0-1$ loss, sigmoid loss, ramp loss and
probit loss satisfy this condition though none of the standard convex loss
functions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large
value of a parameter in the loss function, the sigmoid loss, ramp loss and
probit loss can be made tolerant to non-uniform label noise also if we can
assume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution. Through
extensive empirical studies, we show that risk minimization under the $0-1$
loss, the sigmoid loss and the ramp loss has much better robustness to label
noise when compared to the SVM algorithm."
"This work investigates the use of mixed-norm regularization for sensor
selection in Event-Related Potential (ERP) based Brain-Computer Interfaces
(BCI). The classification problem is cast as a discriminative optimization
framework where sensor selection is induced through the use of mixed-norms.
This framework is extended to the multi-task learning situation where several
similar classification tasks related to different subjects are learned
simultaneously. In this case, multi-task learning helps in leveraging data
scarcity issue yielding to more robust classifiers. For this purpose, we have
introduced a regularizer that induces both sensor selection and classifier
similarities. The different regularization approaches are compared on three ERP
datasets showing the interest of mixed-norm regularization in terms of sensor
selection. The multi-task approaches are evaluated when a small number of
learning examples are available yielding to significant performance
improvements especially for subjects performing poorly."
"This work considers the problem of estimating the parameters of negative
mixture models, i.e. mixture models that possibly involve negative weights. The
contributions of this paper are as follows. (i) We show that every rational
probability distributions on strings, a representation which occurs naturally
in spectral learning, can be computed by a negative mixture of at most two
probabilistic automata (or HMMs). (ii) We propose a method to estimate the
parameters of negative mixture models having a specific tensor structure in
their low order observable moments. Building upon a recent paper on tensor
decompositions for learning latent variable models, we extend this work to the
broader setting of tensors having a symmetric decomposition with positive and
negative weights. We introduce a generalization of the tensor power method for
complex valued tensors, and establish theoretical convergence guarantees. (iii)
We show how our approach applies to negative Gaussian mixture models, for which
we provide some experiments."
"Motivated by multi-distribution divergences, which originate in information
theory, we propose a notion of `multi-point' kernels, and study their
applications. We study a class of kernels based on Jensen type divergences and
show that these can be extended to measure similarity among multiple points. We
study tensor flattening methods and develop a multi-point (kernel) spectral
clustering (MSC) method. We further emphasize on a special case of the proposed
kernels, which is a multi-point extension of the linear (dot-product) kernel
and show the existence of cubic time tensor flattening algorithm in this case.
Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our contributions using standard data
sets and image segmentation tasks."
"We tackle the problem of learning linear classifiers from noisy datasets in a
multiclass setting. The two-class version of this problem was studied a few
years ago by, e.g. Bylander (1994) and Blum et al. (1996): in these
contributions, the proposed approaches to fight the noise revolve around a
Perceptron learning scheme fed with peculiar examples computed through a
weighted average of points from the noisy training set. We propose to build
upon these approaches and we introduce a new algorithm called UMA (for
Unconfused Multiclass additive Algorithm) which may be seen as a generalization
to the multiclass setting of the previous approaches. In order to characterize
the noise we use the confusion matrix as a multiclass extension of the
classification noise studied in the aforementioned literature. Theoretically
well-founded, UMA furthermore displays very good empirical noise robustness, as
evidenced by numerical simulations conducted on both synthetic and real data.
Keywords: Multiclass classification, Perceptron, Noisy labels, Confusion Matrix"
"In many online learning problems we are interested in predicting local
information about some universe of items. For example, we may want to know
whether two items are in the same cluster rather than computing an assignment
of items to clusters; we may want to know which of two teams will win a game
rather than computing a ranking of teams. Although finding the optimal
clustering or ranking is typically intractable, it may be possible to predict
the relationships between items as well as if you could solve the global
optimization problem exactly.
  Formally, we consider an online learning problem in which a learner
repeatedly guesses a pair of labels (l(x), l(y)) and receives an adversarial
payoff depending on those labels. The learner's goal is to receive a payoff
nearly as good as the best fixed labeling of the items. We show that a simple
algorithm based on semidefinite programming can obtain asymptotically optimal
regret in the case where the number of possible labels is O(1), resolving an
open problem posed by Hazan, Kale, and Shalev-Schwartz. Our main technical
contribution is a novel use and analysis of the log determinant regularizer,
exploiting the observation that log det(A + I) upper bounds the entropy of any
distribution with covariance matrix A."
"We provide an information-theoretic analysis of Thompson sampling that
applies across a broad range of online optimization problems in which a
decision-maker must learn from partial feedback. This analysis inherits the
simplicity and elegance of information theory and leads to regret bounds that
scale with the entropy of the optimal-action distribution. This strengthens
preexisting results and yields new insight into how information improves
performance."
"We propose information-directed sampling -- a new approach to online
optimization problems in which a decision-maker must balance between
exploration and exploitation while learning from partial feedback. Each action
is sampled in a manner that minimizes the ratio between squared expected
single-period regret and a measure of information gain: the mutual information
between the optimal action and the next observation. We establish an expected
regret bound for information-directed sampling that applies across a very
general class of models and scales with the entropy of the optimal action
distribution. We illustrate through simple analytic examples how
information-directed sampling accounts for kinds of information that
alternative approaches do not adequately address and that this can lead to
dramatic performance gains. For the widely studied Bernoulli, Gaussian, and
linear bandit problems, we demonstrate state-of-the-art simulation performance."
"This paper revisits the problem of learning a k-CNF Boolean function from
examples in the context of online learning under the logarithmic loss. In doing
so, we give a Bayesian interpretation to one of Valiant's celebrated PAC
learning algorithms, which we then build upon to derive two efficient, online,
probabilistic, supervised learning algorithms for predicting the output of an
unknown k-CNF Boolean function. We analyze the loss of our methods, and show
that the cumulative log-loss can be upper bounded, ignoring logarithmic
factors, by a polynomial function of the size of each example."
"This work investigates into cost behaviors of binary classification measures
in a background of class-imbalanced problems. Twelve performance measures are
studied, such as F measure, G-means in terms of accuracy rates, and of recall
and precision, balance error rate (BER), Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC), Kappa coefficient, etc. A new perspective is presented for those
measures by revealing their cost functions with respect to the class imbalance
ratio. Basically, they are described by four types of cost functions. The
functions provides a theoretical understanding why some measures are suitable
for dealing with class-imbalanced problems. Based on their cost functions, we
are able to conclude that G-means of accuracy rates and BER are suitable
measures because they show ""proper"" cost behaviors in terms of ""a
misclassification from a small class will cause a greater cost than that from a
large class"". On the contrary, F1 measure, G-means of recall and precision, MCC
and Kappa coefficient measures do not produce such behaviors so that they are
unsuitable to serve our goal in dealing with the problems properly."
"This paper presents an approximate method for performing Bayesian inference
in models with conditional independence over a decentralized network of
learning agents. The method first employs variational inference on each
individual learning agent to generate a local approximate posterior, the agents
transmit their local posteriors to other agents in the network, and finally
each agent combines its set of received local posteriors. The key insight in
this work is that, for many Bayesian models, approximate inference schemes
destroy symmetry and dependencies in the model that are crucial to the correct
application of Bayes' rule when combining the local posteriors. The proposed
method addresses this issue by including an additional optimization step in the
combination procedure that accounts for these broken dependencies. Experiments
on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the decentralized method provides
advantages in computational performance and predictive test likelihood over
previous batch and distributed methods."
"In this paper, we study the problem of learning a monotone DNF with at most
$s$ terms of size (number of variables in each term) at most $r$ ($s$ term
$r$-MDNF) from membership queries. This problem is equivalent to the problem of
learning a general hypergraph using hyperedge-detecting queries, a problem
motivated by applications arising in chemical reactions and genome sequencing.
  We first present new lower bounds for this problem and then present
deterministic and randomized adaptive algorithms with query complexities that
are almost optimal. All the algorithms we present in this paper run in time
linear in the query complexity and the number of variables $n$. In addition,
all of the algorithms we present in this paper are asymptotically tight for
fixed $r$ and/or $s$."
"We present a new algorithm for domain adaptation improving upon a discrepancy
minimization algorithm previously shown to outperform a number of algorithms
for this task. Unlike many previous algorithms for domain adaptation, our
algorithm does not consist of a fixed reweighting of the losses over the
training sample. We show that our algorithm benefits from a solid theoretical
foundation and more favorable learning bounds than discrepancy minimization. We
present a detailed description of our algorithm and give several efficient
solutions for solving its optimization problem. We also report the results of
several experiments showing that it outperforms discrepancy minimization."
"We consider the problem of proper learning a Boolean Halfspace with integer
weights $\{0,1,\ldots,t\}$ from membership queries only. The best known
algorithm for this problem is an adaptive algorithm that asks $n^{O(t^5)}$
membership queries where the best lower bound for the number of membership
queries is $n^t$ [Learning Threshold Functions with Small Weights Using
Membership Queries. COLT 1999]
  In this paper we close this gap and give an adaptive proper learning
algorithm with two rounds that asks $n^{O(t)}$ membership queries. We also give
a non-adaptive proper learning algorithm that asks $n^{O(t^3)}$ membership
queries."
"The fundamental theorem of statistical learning states that for binary
classification problems, any Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learning rule
has close to optimal sample complexity. In this paper we seek for a generic
optimal learner for multiclass prediction. We start by proving a surprising
result: a generic optimal multiclass learner must be improper, namely, it must
have the ability to output hypotheses which do not belong to the hypothesis
class, even though it knows that all the labels are generated by some
hypothesis from the class. In particular, no ERM learner is optimal. This
brings back the fundmamental question of ""how to learn""? We give a complete
answer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion
multiclass learner of Rubinstein et al (2006) showing that its sample
complexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular
hypothesis class of generalized linear classifiers. We derive optimal learners
that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally efficient.
Furthermore, we show that the sample complexity of these learners is better
than the sample complexity of the ERM rule, thus settling in negative an open
question due to Collins (2005)."
"We prove the existence of a canonical form for semi-deterministic transducers
with incomparable sets of output strings. Based on this, we develop an
algorithm which learns semi-deterministic transducers given access to
translation queries. We also prove that there is no learning algorithm for
semi-deterministic transducers that uses only domain knowledge."
"We consider a reinforcement learning setting introduced in (Maillard et al.,
NIPS 2011) where the learner does not have explicit access to the states of the
underlying Markov decision process (MDP). Instead, she has access to several
models that map histories of past interactions to states. Here we improve over
known regret bounds in this setting, and more importantly generalize to the
case where the models given to the learner do not contain a true model
resulting in an MDP representation but only approximations of it. We also give
improved error bounds for state aggregation."
"We study the convex relaxation of clustering and hamming embedding, focusing
on the asymmetric case (co-clustering and asymmetric hamming embedding),
understanding their relationship to LSH as studied by (Charikar 2002) and to
the max-norm ball, and the differences between their symmetric and asymmetric
versions."
"We present algorithms for reducing the Dueling Bandits problem to the
conventional (stochastic) Multi-Armed Bandits problem. The Dueling Bandits
problem is an online model of learning with ordinal feedback of the form ""A is
preferred to B"" (as opposed to cardinal feedback like ""A has value 2.5""),
giving it wide applicability in learning from implicit user feedback and
revealed and stated preferences. In contrast to existing algorithms for the
Dueling Bandits problem, our reductions -- named $\Doubler$, $\MultiSbm$ and
$\DoubleSbm$ -- provide a generic schema for translating the extensive body of
known results about conventional Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms to the Dueling
Bandits setting. For $\Doubler$ and $\MultiSbm$ we prove regret upper bounds in
both finite and infinite settings, and conjecture about the performance of
$\DoubleSbm$ which empirically outperforms the other two as well as previous
algorithms in our experiments. In addition, we provide the first almost optimal
regret bound in terms of second order terms, such as the differences between
the values of the arms."
"The logistic loss function is often advocated in machine learning and
statistics as a smooth and strictly convex surrogate for the 0-1 loss. In this
paper we investigate the question of whether these smoothness and convexity
properties make the logistic loss preferable to other widely considered options
such as the hinge loss. We show that in contrast to known asymptotic bounds, as
long as the number of prediction/optimization iterations is sub exponential,
the logistic loss provides no improvement over a generic non-smooth loss
function such as the hinge loss. In particular we show that the convergence
rate of stochastic logistic optimization is bounded from below by a polynomial
in the diameter of the decision set and the number of prediction iterations,
and provide a matching tight upper bound. This resolves the COLT open problem
of McMahan and Streeter (2012)."
"Dyadic prediction methods operate on pairs of objects (dyads), aiming to
infer labels for out-of-sample dyads. We consider the full and almost full cold
start problem in dyadic prediction, a setting that occurs when both objects in
an out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them
has been observed, but very few times. A popular approach for addressing this
problem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature
representation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor
product pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we
introduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the
fields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that
the two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel
approach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive
performance. Moreover, unlike existing tensor product kernel methods, the
two-step method allows closed-form solutions for training and parameter
selection via cross-validation estimates both in the full and almost full cold
start settings, making the approach much more efficient and straightforward to
implement."
"We study a new class of online learning problems where each of the online
algorithm's actions is assigned an adversarial value, and the loss of the
algorithm at each step is a known and deterministic function of the values
assigned to its recent actions. This class includes problems where the
algorithm's loss is the minimum over the recent adversarial values, the maximum
over the recent values, or a linear combination of the recent values. We
analyze the minimax regret of this class of problems when the algorithm
receives bandit feedback, and prove that when the minimum or maximum functions
are used, the minimax regret is $\tilde \Omega(T^{2/3})$ (so called hard online
learning problems), and when a linear function is used, the minimax regret is
$\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ (so called easy learning problems). Previously, the only
online learning problem that was known to be provably hard was the multi-armed
bandit with switching costs."
"This paper concerns the distributed training of nonlinear kernel machines on
Map-Reduce. We show that a re-formulation of Nystr\""om approximation based
solution which is solved using gradient based techniques is well suited for
this, especially when it is necessary to work with a large number of basis
points. The main advantages of this approach are: avoidance of computing the
pseudo-inverse of the kernel sub-matrix corresponding to the basis points;
simplicity and efficiency of the distributed part of the computations; and,
friendliness to stage-wise addition of basis points. We implement the method
using an AllReduce tree on Hadoop and demonstrate its value on a few large
benchmark datasets."
"Distributed training of $l_1$ regularized classifiers has received great
attention recently. Most existing methods approach this problem by taking steps
obtained from approximating the objective by a quadratic approximation that is
decoupled at the individual variable level. These methods are designed for
multicore and MPI platforms where communication costs are low. They are
inefficient on systems such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity
machines where communication costs are substantial. In this paper we design a
distributed algorithm for $l_1$ regularization that is much better suited for
such systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to
support these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is
to do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function
within each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that
is matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer
iterations, thus yielding a faster overall method. Distributed Gauss-Seidel and
Gauss-Southwell greedy schemes are used for choosing variables to update in
each step. We establish global convergence theory for our algorithm, including
Q-linear rate of convergence. Experiments on two benchmark problems show our
method to be much faster than existing methods."
"We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems where the expected reward
is a Lipschitz function of the arm, and where the set of arms is either
discrete or continuous. For discrete Lipschitz bandits, we derive asymptotic
problem specific lower bounds for the regret satisfied by any algorithm, and
propose OSLB and CKL-UCB, two algorithms that efficiently exploit the Lipschitz
structure of the problem. In fact, we prove that OSLB is asymptotically
optimal, as its asymptotic regret matches the lower bound. The regret analysis
of our algorithms relies on a new concentration inequality for weighted sums of
KL divergences between the empirical distributions of rewards and their true
distributions. For continuous Lipschitz bandits, we propose to first discretize
the action space, and then apply OSLB or CKL-UCB, algorithms that provably
exploit the structure efficiently. This approach is shown, through numerical
experiments, to significantly outperform existing algorithms that directly deal
with the continuous set of arms. Finally the results and algorithms are
extended to contextual bandits with similarities."
"We present a new optimization-theoretic approach to analyzing
Follow-the-Leader style algorithms, particularly in the setting where
perturbations are used as a tool for regularization. We show that adding a
strongly convex penalty function to the decision rule and adding stochastic
perturbations to data correspond to deterministic and stochastic smoothing
operations, respectively. We establish an equivalence between ""Follow the
Regularized Leader"" and ""Follow the Perturbed Leader"" up to the smoothness
properties. This intuition leads to a new generic analysis framework that
recovers and improves the previous known regret bounds of the class of
algorithms commonly known as Follow the Perturbed Leader."
"Random Forest (RF) is a powerful ensemble method for classification and
regression tasks. It consists of decision trees set. Although, a single tree is
well interpretable for human, the ensemble of trees is a black-box model. The
popular technique to look inside the RF model is to visualize a RF proximity
matrix obtained on data samples with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) method.
Herein, we present a novel method based on Self-Organising Maps (SOM) for
revealing intrinsic relationships in data that lay inside the RF used for
classification tasks. We propose an algorithm to learn the SOM with the
proximity matrix obtained from the RF. The visualization of RF proximity matrix
with MDS and SOM is compared. What is more, the SOM learned with the RF
proximity matrix has better classification accuracy in comparison to SOM
learned with Euclidean distance. Presented approach enables better
understanding of the RF and additionally improves accuracy of the SOM."
"In this paper, we set forth a new vision of reinforcement learning developed
by us over the past few years, one that yields mathematically rigorous
solutions to longstanding important questions that have remained unresolved:
(i) how to design reliable, convergent, and robust reinforcement learning
algorithms (ii) how to guarantee that reinforcement learning satisfies
pre-specified ""safety"" guarantees, and remains in a stable region of the
parameter space (iii) how to design ""off-policy"" temporal difference learning
algorithms in a reliable and stable manner, and finally (iv) how to integrate
the study of reinforcement learning into the rich theory of stochastic
optimization. In this paper, we provide detailed answers to all these questions
using the powerful framework of proximal operators.
  The key idea that emerges is the use of primal dual spaces connected through
the use of a Legendre transform. This allows temporal difference updates to
occur in dual spaces, allowing a variety of important technical advantages. The
Legendre transform elegantly generalizes past algorithms for solving
reinforcement learning problems, such as natural gradient methods, which we
show relate closely to the previously unconnected framework of mirror descent
methods. Equally importantly, proximal operator theory enables the systematic
development of operator splitting methods that show how to safely and reliably
decompose complex products of gradients that occur in recent variants of
gradient-based temporal difference learning. This key technical innovation
makes it possible to finally design ""true"" stochastic gradient methods for
reinforcement learning. Finally, Legendre transforms enable a variety of other
benefits, including modeling sparsity and domain geometry. Our work builds
extensively on recent work on the convergence of saddle-point algorithms, and
on the theory of monotone operators."
"BayesOpt is a library with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods to
solve nonlinear optimization, stochastic bandits or sequential experimental
design problems. Bayesian optimization is sample efficient by building a
posterior distribution to capture the evidence and prior knowledge for the
target function. Built in standard C++, the library is extremely efficient
while being portable and flexible. It includes a common interface for C, C++,
Python, Matlab and Octave."
"K-means algorithm is a very popular clustering algorithm which is famous for
its simplicity. Distance measure plays a very important rule on the performance
of this algorithm. We have different distance measure techniques available. But
choosing a proper technique for distance calculation is totally dependent on
the type of the data that we are going to cluster. In this paper an
experimental study is done in Matlab to cluster the iris and wine data sets
with different distance measures and thereby observing the variation of the
performances shown."
"A useful strategy to deal with complex classification scenarios is the
""divide and conquer"" approach. The mixture of experts (MOE) technique makes use
of this strategy by joinly training a set of classifiers, or experts, that are
specialized in different regions of the input space. A global model, or gate
function, complements the experts by learning a function that weights their
relevance in different parts of the input space. Local feature selection
appears as an attractive alternative to improve the specialization of experts
and gate function, particularly, for the case of high dimensional data. Our
main intuition is that particular subsets of dimensions, or subspaces, are
usually more appropriate to classify instances located in different regions of
the input space. Accordingly, this work contributes with a regularized variant
of MoE that incorporates an embedded process for local feature selection using
$L1$ regularization, with a simultaneous expert selection. The experiments are
still pending."
"We prove that there is no class-dual for almost all sublinear models on
graphs."
"The performance of prediction models is often based on ""abstract metrics""
that estimate the model's ability to limit residual errors between the observed
and predicted values. However, meaningful evaluation and selection of
prediction models for end-user domains requires holistic and
application-sensitive performance measures. Inspired by energy consumption
prediction models used in the emerging ""big data"" domain of Smart Power Grids,
we propose a suite of performance measures to rationally compare models along
the dimensions of scale independence, reliability, volatility and cost. We
include both application independent and dependent measures, the latter
parameterized to allow customization by domain experts to fit their scenario.
While our measures are generalizable to other domains, we offer an empirical
analysis using real energy use data for three Smart Grid applications:
planning, customer education and demand response, which are relevant for energy
sustainability. Our results underscore the value of the proposed measures to
offer a deeper insight into models' behavior and their impact on real
applications, which benefit both data mining researchers and practitioners."
"Information divergence that measures the difference between two nonnegative
matrices or tensors has found its use in a variety of machine learning
problems. Examples are Nonnegative Matrix/Tensor Factorization, Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding, topic models, and Bayesian network optimization. The
success of such a learning task depends heavily on a suitable divergence. A
large variety of divergences have been suggested and analyzed, but very few
results are available for an objective choice of the optimal divergence for a
given task. Here we present a framework that facilitates automatic selection of
the best divergence among a given family, based on standard maximum likelihood
estimation. We first propose an approximated Tweedie distribution for the
beta-divergence family. Selecting the best beta then becomes a machine learning
problem solved by maximum likelihood. Next, we reformulate alpha-divergence in
terms of beta-divergence, which enables automatic selection of alpha by maximum
likelihood with reuse of the learning principle for beta-divergence.
Furthermore, we show the connections between gamma and beta-divergences as well
as R\'enyi and alpha-divergences, such that our automatic selection framework
is extended to non-separable divergences. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world data demonstrate that our method can quite accurately select
information divergence across different learning problems and various
divergence families."
"In this paper we explore how machine learning techniques can be applied to
the discovery of efficient mathematical identities. We introduce an attribute
grammar framework for representing symbolic expressions. Given a set of grammar
rules we build trees that combine different rules, looking for branches which
yield compositions that are analytically equivalent to a target expression, but
of lower computational complexity. However, as the size of the trees grows
exponentially with the complexity of the target expression, brute force search
is impractical for all but the simplest of expressions. Consequently, we
introduce two novel learning approaches that are able to learn from simpler
expressions to guide the tree search. The first of these is a simple n-gram
model, the other being a recursive neural-network. We show how these approaches
enable us to derive complex identities, beyond reach of brute-force search, or
human derivation."
"We study the problem of multiclass classification with an extremely large
number of classes (k), with the goal of obtaining train and test time
complexity logarithmic in the number of classes. We develop top-down tree
construction approaches for constructing logarithmic depth trees. On the
theoretical front, we formulate a new objective function, which is optimized at
each node of the tree and creates dynamic partitions of the data which are both
pure (in terms of class labels) and balanced. We demonstrate that under
favorable conditions, we can construct logarithmic depth trees that have leaves
with low label entropy. However, the objective function at the nodes is
challenging to optimize computationally. We address the empirical problem with
a new online decision tree construction procedure. Experiments demonstrate that
this online algorithm quickly achieves improvement in test error compared to
more common logarithmic training time approaches, which makes it a plausible
method in computationally constrained large-k applications."
"Many machine learning applications involve jointly predicting multiple
mutually dependent output variables. Learning to search is a family of methods
where the complex decision problem is cast into a sequence of decisions via a
search space. Although these methods have shown promise both in theory and in
practice, implementing them has been burdensomely awkward. In this paper, we
show the search space can be defined by an arbitrary imperative program,
turning learning to search into a credit assignment compiler. Altogether with
the algorithmic improvements for the compiler, we radically reduce the
complexity of programming and the running time. We demonstrate the feasibility
of our approach on multiple joint prediction tasks. In all cases, we obtain
accuracies as high as alternative approaches, at drastically reduced execution
and programming time."
"We provide a general mechanism to design online learning algorithms based on
a minimax analysis within a drifting-games framework. Different online learning
settings (Hedge, multi-armed bandit problems and online convex optimization)
are studied by converting into various kinds of drifting games. The original
minimax analysis for drifting games is then used and generalized by applying a
series of relaxations, starting from choosing a convex surrogate of the 0-1
loss function. With different choices of surrogates, we not only recover
existing algorithms, but also propose new algorithms that are totally
parameter-free and enjoy other useful properties. Moreover, our drifting-games
framework naturally allows us to study high probability bounds without
resorting to any concentration results, and also a generalized notion of regret
that measures how good the algorithm is compared to all but the top small
fraction of candidates. Finally, we translate our new Hedge algorithm into a
new adaptive boosting algorithm that is computationally faster as shown in
experiments, since it ignores a large number of examples on each round."
"Training deep directed graphical models with many hidden variables and
performing inference remains a major challenge. Helmholtz machines and deep
belief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed
to train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the
directed generative model but also a conditional generative model (the
inference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the
posterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel
interpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better
estimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables
multiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance
sampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference
network as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is confirmed
experimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this
reweighted wake-sleep procedure. Based on this interpretation, we propose that
a sigmoidal belief network is not sufficiently powerful for the layers of the
inference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more
powerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative
models."
"Because reinforcement learning suffers from a lack of scalability, online
value (and Q-) function approximation has received increasing interest this
last decade. This contribution introduces a novel approximation scheme, namely
the Kalman Temporal Differences (KTD) framework, that exhibits the following
features: sample-efficiency, non-linear approximation, non-stationarity
handling and uncertainty management. A first KTD-based algorithm is provided
for deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) which produces biased
estimates in the case of stochastic transitions. Than the eXtended KTD
framework (XKTD), solving stochastic MDP, is described. Convergence is analyzed
for special cases for both deterministic and stochastic transitions. Related
algorithms are experimented on classical benchmarks. They compare favorably to
the state of the art while exhibiting the announced features."
"Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) and its variants have become hot research
topics recently, and widely applied to many classification problems, such as
character recognition and document categorization. Often, classification RBM
ignores the interclass relationship or prior knowledge of sharing information
among classes. In this paper, we are interested in RBM with the hierarchical
prior over classes. We assume parameters for nearby nodes are correlated in the
hierarchical tree, and further the parameters at each node of the tree be
orthogonal to those at its ancestors. We propose a hierarchical correlated RBM
for classification problem, which generalizes the classification RBM with
sharing information among different classes. In order to reduce the redundancy
between node parameters in the hierarchy, we also introduce orthogonal
restrictions to our objective function. We test our method on challenge
datasets, and show promising results compared to competitive baselines."
"We evaluate the following Machine Learning techniques for Green Energy (Wind,
Solar) Prediction: Bayesian Inference, Neural Networks, Support Vector
Machines, Clustering techniques (PCA). Our objective is to predict green energy
using weather forecasts, predict deviations from forecast green energy, find
correlation amongst different weather parameters and green energy availability,
recover lost or missing energy (/ weather) data. We use historical weather data
and weather forecasts for the same."
"We study a sequential resource allocation problem involving a fixed number of
recurring jobs. At each time-step the manager should distribute available
resources among the jobs in order to maximise the expected number of completed
jobs. Allocating more resources to a given job increases the probability that
it completes, but with a cut-off. Specifically, we assume a linear model where
the probability increases linearly until it equals one, after which allocating
additional resources is wasteful. We assume the difficulty of each job is
unknown and present the first algorithm for this problem and prove upper and
lower bounds on its regret. Despite its apparent simplicity, the problem has a
rich structure: we show that an appropriate optimistic algorithm can improve
its learning speed dramatically beyond the results one normally expects for
similar problems as the problem becomes resource-laden."
"Spectral learning recently generated lots of excitement in machine learning,
largely because it is the first known method to produce consistent estimates
(under suitable conditions) for several latent variable models. In contrast,
maximum likelihood estimates may get trapped in local optima due to the
non-convex nature of the likelihood function of latent variable models. In this
paper, we do an empirical evaluation of spectral learning (SL) and expectation
maximization (EM), which reveals an important gap between the theory and the
practice. First, SL often leads to negative probabilities. Second, EM often
yields better estimates than spectral learning and it does not seem to get
stuck in local optima. We discuss how the rank of the model parameters and the
amount of training data can yield negative probabilities. We also question the
common belief that maximum likelihood estimators are necessarily inconsistent."
"Data mining research into time series classification (TSC) has focussed on
alternative distance measures for nearest neighbour classifiers. It is standard
practice to use 1-NN with Euclidean or dynamic time warping (DTW) distance as a
straw man for comparison. As part of a wider investigation into elastic
distance measures for TSC~\cite{lines14elastic}, we perform a series of
experiments to test whether this standard practice is valid.
  Specifically, we compare 1-NN classifiers with Euclidean and DTW distance to
standard classifiers, examine whether the performance of 1-NN Euclidean
approaches that of 1-NN DTW as the number of cases increases, assess whether
there is any benefit of setting $k$ for $k$-NN through cross validation whether
it is worth setting the warping path for DTW through cross validation and
finally is it better to use a window or weighting for DTW. Based on experiments
on 77 problems, we conclude that 1-NN with Euclidean distance is fairly easy to
beat but 1-NN with DTW is not, if window size is set through cross validation."
"Dictionary learning is a branch of signal processing and machine learning
that aims at finding a frame (called dictionary) in which some training data
admits a sparse representation. The sparser the representation, the better the
dictionary. The resulting dictionary is in general a dense matrix, and its
manipulation can be computationally costly both at the learning stage and later
in the usage of this dictionary, for tasks such as sparse coding. Dictionary
learning is thus limited to relatively small-scale problems. In this paper,
inspired by usual fast transforms, we consider a general dictionary structure
that allows cheaper manipulation, and propose an algorithm to learn such
dictionaries --and their fast implementation-- over training data. The approach
is demonstrated experimentally with the factorization of the Hadamard matrix
and with synthetic dictionary learning experiments."
"This paper proposes a new method of probabilistic prediction, which is based
on conformal prediction. The method is applied to the standard USPS data set
and gives encouraging results."
"Symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix approximation is an important
problem with applications in kernel methods. However, existing SPSD matrix
approximation methods such as the Nystr\""om method only have weak error bounds.
In this paper we conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation model
and establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the prototype model for
it has more efficient and effective extensions, and some of its extensions have
high scalability. Though the prototype model itself is not suitable for
large-scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which the
analysis of its extensions relies.
  This paper offers novel theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and a
highly accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for the
prototype model and improve the error bound of an existing column selection
algorithm to match the lower bound. In this way, we obtain the first optimal
column selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that the
prototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple
column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third, we propose a
so-called spectral shifting model to make the approximation more accurate when
the eigenvalues of the matrix decay slowly, and the improvement is
theoretically quantified. The spectral shifting method can also be applied to
improve other SPSD matrix approximation models."
"We study the bandit problem where arms are associated with stationary
phi-mixing processes and where rewards are therefore dependent: the question
that arises from this setting is that of recovering some independence by
ignoring the value of some rewards. As we shall see, the bandit problem we
tackle requires us to address the exploration/exploitation/independence
trade-off. To do so, we provide a UCB strategy together with a general regret
analysis for the case where the size of the independence blocks (the ignored
rewards) is fixed and we go a step beyond by providing an algorithm that is
able to compute the size of the independence blocks from the data. Finally, we
give an analysis of our bandit problem in the restless case, i.e., in the
situation where the time counters for all mixing processes simultaneously
evolve."
"In this research we address the problem of capturing recurring concepts in a
data stream environment. Recurrence capture enables the re-use of previously
learned classifiers without the need for re-learning while providing for better
accuracy during the concept recurrence interval. We capture concepts by
applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to Decision Tree classifiers to
obtain highly compressed versions of the trees at concept drift points in the
stream and store such trees in a repository for future use. Our empirical
results on real world and synthetic data exhibiting varying degrees of
recurrence show that the Fourier compressed trees are more robust to noise and
are able to capture recurring concepts with higher precision than a meta
learning approach that chooses to re-use classifiers in their originally
occurring form."
"Mixability is a property of a loss which characterizes when fast convergence
is possible in the game of prediction with expert advice. We show that a key
property of mixability generalizes, and the exp and log operations present in
the usual theory are not as special as one might have thought. In doing this we
introduce a more general notion of $\Phi$-mixability where $\Phi$ is a general
entropy (\ie, any convex function on probabilities). We show how a property
shared by the convex dual of any such entropy yields a natural algorithm (the
minimizer of a regret bound) which, analogous to the classical aggregating
algorithm, is guaranteed a constant regret when used with $\Phi$-mixable
losses. We characterize precisely which $\Phi$ have $\Phi$-mixable losses and
put forward a number of conjectures about the optimality and relationships
between different choices of entropy."
"Learning the parameters of graphical models using the maximum likelihood
estimation is generally hard which requires an approximation. Maximum composite
likelihood estimations are statistical approximations of the maximum likelihood
estimation which are higher-order generalizations of the maximum
pseudo-likelihood estimation. In this paper, we propose a composite likelihood
method and investigate its property. Furthermore, we apply our composite
likelihood method to restricted Boltzmann machines."
"The explosion in the amount of data available for analysis often necessitates
a transition from batch to incremental clustering methods, which process one
element at a time and typically store only a small subset of the data. In this
paper, we initiate the formal analysis of incremental clustering methods
focusing on the types of cluster structure that they are able to detect. We
find that the incremental setting is strictly weaker than the batch model,
proving that a fundamental class of cluster structures that can readily be
detected in the batch setting is impossible to identify using any incremental
method. Furthermore, we show how the limitations of incremental clustering can
be overcome by allowing additional clusters."
"This paper examines the efficacy of different optimization techniques in a
primal formulation of a support vector machine (SVM). Three main techniques are
compared. The dataset used to compare all three techniques was the Sentiment
Analysis on Movie Reviews dataset, from kaggle.com."
"Structure learning of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) can be cast into an
L1-regularized optimization problem. To avoid optimizing over a fully linked
model, gain-based or gradient-based feature selection methods start from an
empty model and incrementally add top ranked features to it. However, for
high-dimensional problems like statistical relational learning, training time
of these incremental methods can be dominated by the cost of evaluating the
gain or gradient of a large collection of candidate features. In this study we
propose a fast feature evaluation algorithm called Contrastive Feature
Induction (CFI), which only evaluates a subset of features that involve both
variables with high signals (deviation from mean) and variables with high
errors (residue). We prove that the gradient of candidate features can be
represented solely as a function of signals and errors, and that CFI is an
efficient approximation of gradient-based evaluation methods. Experiments on
synthetic and real data sets show competitive learning speed and accuracy of
CFI on pairwise CRFs, compared to state-of-the-art structure learning methods
such as full optimization over all features, and Grafting."
"We consider stochastic bandit problems with a continuous set of arms and
where the expected reward is a continuous and unimodal function of the arm. No
further assumption is made regarding the smoothness and the structure of the
expected reward function. For these problems, we propose the Stochastic
Pentachotomy (SP) algorithm, and derive finite-time upper bounds on its regret
and optimization error. In particular, we show that, for any expected reward
function $\mu$ that behaves as $\mu(x)=\mu(x^\star)-C|x-x^\star|^\xi$ locally
around its maximizer $x^\star$ for some $\xi, C>0$, the SP algorithm is
order-optimal. Namely its regret and optimization error scale as
$O(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ and $O(\sqrt{\log(T)/T})$, respectively, when the time
horizon $T$ grows large. These scalings are achieved without the knowledge of
$\xi$ and $C$. Our algorithm is based on asymptotically optimal sequential
statistical tests used to successively trim an interval that contains the best
arm with high probability. To our knowledge, the SP algorithm constitutes the
first sequential arm selection rule that achieves a regret and optimization
error scaling as $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, respectively, up to a
logarithmic factor for non-smooth expected reward functions, as well as for
smooth functions with unknown smoothness."
"Two types of low cost-per-iteration gradient descent methods have been
extensively studied in parallel. One is online or stochastic gradient descent
(OGD/SGD), and the other is randomzied coordinate descent (RBCD). In this
paper, we combine the two types of methods together and propose online
randomized block coordinate descent (ORBCD). At each iteration, ORBCD only
computes the partial gradient of one block coordinate of one mini-batch
samples. ORBCD is well suited for the composite minimization problem where one
function is the average of the losses of a large number of samples and the
other is a simple regularizer defined on high dimensional variables. We show
that the iteration complexity of ORBCD has the same order as OGD or SGD. For
strongly convex functions, by reducing the variance of stochastic gradients, we
show that ORBCD can converge at a geometric rate in expectation, matching the
convergence rate of SGD with variance reduction and RBCD."
"Which ads should we display in sponsored search in order to maximize our
revenue? How should we dynamically rank information sources to maximize the
value of the ranking? These applications exhibit strong diminishing returns:
Redundancy decreases the marginal utility of each ad or information source. We
show that these and other problems can be formalized as repeatedly selecting an
assignment of items to positions to maximize a sequence of monotone submodular
functions that arrive one by one. We present an efficient algorithm for this
general problem and analyze it in the no-regret model. Our algorithm possesses
strong theoretical guarantees, such as a performance ratio that converges to
the optimal constant of 1 - 1/e. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on two
real-world online optimization problems on the web: ad allocation with
submodular utilities, and dynamically ranking blogs to detect information
cascades. Finally, we present a second algorithm that handles the more general
case in which the feasible sets are given by a matroid constraint, while still
maintaining a 1 - 1/e asymptotic performance ratio."
"Multi-label learning deals with the classification problems where each
instance can be assigned with multiple labels simultaneously. Conventional
multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations.
It is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that the label sets for
training instances are fully labeled without any missing labels. However, in
many real-world multi-label datasets, the label assignments for training
instances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the
labeler from the label set. This problem is especially typical when the number
instances is very large, and the labeling cost is very high, which makes it
almost impossible to get a fully labeled training set. In this paper, we study
the problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label
assignments. We propose an approach, called MPU, based upon positive and
unlabeled stochastic gradient descent and stacked models. Unlike prior works,
our method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label
correlations simultaneously, and is very scalable, that has linear time
complexities over the size of the data. Extensive experiments on two real-world
multi-label datasets show that our MPU model consistently outperform other
commonly-used baselines."
"Many problems in real-world applications involve predicting several random
variables which are statistically related. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a
great mathematical tool to encode such relationships. The goal of this paper is
to combine MRFs with deep learning algorithms to estimate complex
representations while taking into account the dependencies between the output
random variables. Towards this goal, we propose a training algorithm that is
able to learn structured models jointly with deep features that form the MRF
potentials. Our approach is efficient as it blends learning and inference and
makes use of GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm in the tasks of predicting words from noisy images, as well as
multi-class classification of Flickr photographs. We show that joint learning
of the deep features and the MRF parameters results in significant performance
gains."
"This document describes a novel learning algorithm that classifies ""bags"" of
instances rather than individual instances. A bag is labeled positive if it
contains at least one positive instance (which may or may not be specifically
identified), and negative otherwise. This class of problems is known as
multi-instance learning problems, and is useful in situations where the class
label at an instance level may be unavailable or imprecise or difficult to
obtain, or in situations where the problem is naturally posed as one of
classifying instance groups. The algorithm described here is an ensemble-based
method, wherein the members of the ensemble are lazy learning classifiers
learnt using the Citation Nearest Neighbour method. Diversity among the
ensemble members is achieved by optimizing their parameters using a
multi-objective optimization method, with the objectives being to maximize
Class 1 accuracy and minimize false positive rate. The method has been found to
be effective on the Musk1 benchmark dataset."
"The subspace Restricted Boltzmann Machine (subspaceRBM) is a third-order
Boltzmann machine where multiplicative interactions are between one visible and
two hidden units. There are two kinds of hidden units, namely, gate units and
subspace units. The subspace units reflect variations of a pattern in data and
the gate unit is responsible for activating the subspace units. Additionally,
the gate unit can be seen as a pooling feature. We evaluate the behavior of
subspaceRBM through experiments with MNIST digit recognition task, measuring
reconstruction error and classification error."
"No matter the expressive power and sophistication of supervised learning
algorithms, their effectiveness is restricted by the features describing the
data. This is not a new insight in ML and many methods for feature selection,
transformation, and construction have been developed. But while this is
on-going for general techniques for feature selection and transformation, i.e.
dimensionality reduction, work on feature construction, i.e. enriching the
data, is by now mainly the domain of image, particularly character,
recognition, and NLP.
  In this work, we propose a new general framework for feature construction.
The need for feature construction in a data set is indicated by class outliers
and discriminative pattern mining used to derive features on their
k-neighborhoods. We instantiate the framework with LOF and C4.5-Rules, and
evaluate the usefulness of the derived features on a diverse collection of UCI
data sets. The derived features are more often useful than ones derived by
DC-Fringe, and our approach is much less likely to overfit. But while a weak
learner, Naive Bayes, benefits strongly from the feature construction, the
effect is less pronounced for C4.5, and almost vanishes for an SVM leaner.
  Keywords: feature construction, classification, outlier detection"
"In the last several years, the intimate connection between convex
optimization and learning problems, in both statistical and sequential
frameworks, has shifted the focus of algorithmic machine learning to examine
this interplay. In particular, on one hand, this intertwinement brings forward
new challenges in reassessment of the performance of learning algorithms
including generalization and regret bounds under the assumptions imposed by
convexity such as analytical properties of loss functions (e.g., Lipschitzness,
strong convexity, and smoothness). On the other hand, emergence of datasets of
an unprecedented size, demands the development of novel and more efficient
optimization algorithms to tackle large-scale learning problems.
  The overarching goal of this thesis is to reassess the smoothness of loss
functions in statistical learning, sequential prediction/online learning, and
stochastic optimization and explicate its consequences. In particular we
examine how smoothness of loss function could be beneficial or detrimental in
these settings in terms of sample complexity, statistical consistency, regret
analysis, and convergence rate, and investigate how smoothness can be leveraged
to devise more efficient learning algorithms."
"This paper presents a Fast Synchronization Clustering algorithm (FSynC),
which is an improved version of SynC algorithm. In order to decrease the time
complexity of the original SynC algorithm, we combine grid cell partitioning
method and Red-Black tree to construct the near neighbor point set of every
point. By simulated experiments of some artificial data sets and several real
data sets, we observe that FSynC algorithm can often get less time than SynC
algorithm for many kinds of data sets. At last, it gives some research
expectations to popularize this algorithm."
"We consider sequential decision making in a setting where regret is measured
with respect to a set of stateful reference policies, and feedback is limited
to observing the rewards of the actions performed (the so called ""bandit""
setting). If either the reference policies are stateless rather than stateful,
or the feedback includes the rewards of all actions (the so called ""expert""
setting), previous work shows that the optimal regret grows like
$\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the number of decision rounds $T$.
  The difficulty in our setting is that the decision maker unavoidably loses
track of the internal states of the reference policies, and thus cannot
reliably attribute rewards observed in a certain round to any of the reference
policies. In fact, in this setting it is impossible for the algorithm to
estimate which policy gives the highest (or even approximately highest) total
reward. Nevertheless, we design an algorithm that achieves expected regret that
is sublinear in $T$, of the form $O( T/\log^{1/4}{T})$. Our algorithm is based
on a certain local repetition lemma that may be of independent interest. We
also show that no algorithm can guarantee expected regret better than $O(
T/\log^{3/2} T)$."
"Many real-life data are described by categorical attributes without a
pre-classification. A common data mining method used to extract information
from this type of data is clustering. This method group together the samples
from the data that are more similar than all other samples. But, categorical
data pose a challenge when extracting information because: the calculation of
two objects similarity is usually done by measuring the number of common
features, but ignore a possible importance weighting; if the data may be
divided differently according to different subsets of the features, the
algorithm may find clusters with different meanings from each other,
difficulting the post analysis. Data Co-Clustering of categorical data is the
technique that tries to find subsets of samples that share a subset of features
in common. By doing so, not only a sample may belong to more than one cluster
but, the feature selection of each cluster describe its own characteristics. In
this paper a novel Co-Clustering technique for categorical data is proposed by
using Locality Sensitive Hashing technique in order to preprocess a list of
Co-Clusters seeds based on a previous research. Results indicate this technique
is capable of finding high quality Co-Clusters in many different categorical
data sets and scales linearly with the data set size."
"We propose to exploit {\em reconstruction} as a layer-local training signal
for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target
propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce
the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many
levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for
back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction
that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction
of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also
allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder
takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in
input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target
towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side
information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation
in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but
larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long
chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good
auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by
transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them,
flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical
justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with
conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or
experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated
target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through
many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations."
"With advances in data collection technologies, tensor data is assuming
increasing prominence in many applications and the problem of supervised tensor
learning has emerged as a topic of critical significance in the data mining and
machine learning community. Conventional methods for supervised tensor learning
mainly focus on learning kernels by flattening the tensor into vectors or
matrices, however structural information within the tensors will be lost. In
this paper, we introduce a new scheme to design structure-preserving kernels
for supervised tensor learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to leverage
the naturally available structure within the tensorial representation to encode
prior knowledge in the kernel. We proposed a tensor kernel that can preserve
tensor structures based upon dual-tensorial mapping. The dual-tensorial mapping
function can map each tensor instance in the input space to another tensor in
the feature space while preserving the tensorial structure. Theoretically, our
approach is an extension of the conventional kernels in the vector space to
tensor space. We applied our novel kernel in conjunction with SVM to real-world
tensor classification problems including brain fMRI classification for three
different diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, ADHD and brain damage by HIV).
Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approach can
effectively boost tensor classification performances, particularly with small
sample sizes."
"We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problems, where subsets of base arms with unknown distributions
form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms
contained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We
further consider the extension in which more based arms could be
probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms.
The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it
only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of
nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline
(\alpha,\beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome
distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\beta}
generates an {\alpha} fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of
an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize
(\alpha,\beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the
\alpha{\beta} fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal
super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the
algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n)
distribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we
further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward
functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1
algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it
significantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial
bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new
applications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization,
both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social
influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered
arms."
"Many of the ordinal regression models that have been proposed in the
literature can be seen as methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the
zero-one, absolute, or squared loss functions. A key property that allows to
study the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher
consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss
functions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability
distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the
surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will
characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss
functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector
ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that,
for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal
regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the
derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex
margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk
bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk
bounds for binary classification. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel
surrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with
competing approaches on 9 different datasets. Our method shows to be highly
competitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9
datasets."
"We study the attainable regret for online linear optimization problems with
bandit feedback, where unlike the full-information setting, the player can only
observe its own loss rather than the full loss vector. We show that the price
of bandit information in this setting can be as large as $d$, disproving the
well-known conjecture that the regret for bandit linear optimization is at most
$\sqrt{d}$ times the full-information regret. Surprisingly, this is shown using
""trivial"" modifications of standard domains, which have no effect in the
full-information setting. This and other results we present highlight some
interesting differences between full-information and bandit learning, which
were not considered in previous literature."
"The VC dimension measures the capacity of a learning machine, and a low VC
dimension leads to good generalization. While SVMs produce state-of-the-art
learning performance, it is well known that the VC dimension of a SVM can be
unbounded; despite good results in practice, there is no guarantee of good
generalization. In this paper, we show how to learn a hyperplane classifier by
minimizing an exact, or \boldmath{$\Theta$} bound on its VC dimension. The
proposed approach, termed as the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM), involves
solving a simple linear programming problem. Experimental results show, that on
a number of benchmark datasets, the proposed approach learns classifiers with
error rates much less than conventional SVMs, while often using fewer support
vectors. On many benchmark datasets, the number of support vectors is less than
one-tenth the number used by SVMs, indicating that the MCM does indeed learn
simpler representations."
"In this paper, a robust online sequential extreme learning machine (ROS-ELM)
is proposed. It is based on the original OS-ELM with an adaptive selective
ensemble framework. Two novel insights are proposed in this paper. First, a
novel selective ensemble algorithm referred to as particle swarm optimization
selective ensemble (PSOSEN) is proposed. Noting that PSOSEN is a general
selective ensemble method which is applicable to any learning algorithms,
including batch learning and online learning. Second, an adaptive selective
ensemble framework for online learning is designed to balance the robustness
and complexity of the algorithm. Experiments for both regression and
classification problems with UCI data sets are carried out. Comparisons between
OS-ELM, simple ensemble OS-ELM (EOS-ELM) and the proposed ROS-ELM empirically
show that ROS-ELM significantly improves the robustness and stability."
"We propose a novel approach to sufficient dimension reduction in regression,
based on estimating contour directions of negligible variation for the response
surface. These directions span the orthogonal complement of the minimal space
relevant for the regression, and can be extracted according to a measure of the
variation in the response, leading to General Contour Regression(GCR). In
comparison to exiisting sufficient dimension reduction techniques, this
sontour-based mothology guarantees exhaustive estimation of the central space
under ellipticity of the predictoor distribution and very mild additional
assumptions, while maintaining vn-consisytency and somputational ease.
Moreover, it proves to be robust to departures from ellipticity. We also
establish some useful population properties for GCR. Simulations to compare
performance with that of standard techniques such as ordinary least squares,
sliced inverse regression, principal hessian directions, and sliced average
variance estimation confirm the advntages anticipated by theoretical analyses.
We also demonstrate the use of contour-based methods on a data set concerning
grades of students from Massachusetts colleges."
"Vehicular sensor data consists of multiple time-series arising from a number
of sensors. Using such multi-sensor data we would like to detect occurrences of
specific events that vehicles encounter, e.g., corresponding to particular
maneuvers that a vehicle makes or conditions that it encounters. Events are
characterized by similar waveform patterns re-appearing within one or more
sensors. Further such patterns can be of variable duration. In this work, we
propose a method for detecting such events in time-series data using a novel
feature descriptor motivated by similar ideas in image processing. We define
the shape histogram: a constant dimension descriptor that nevertheless captures
patterns of variable duration. We demonstrate the efficacy of using shape
histograms as features to detect events in an SVM-based, multi-sensor,
supervised learning scenario, i.e., multiple time-series are used to detect an
event. We present results on real-life vehicular sensor data and show that our
technique performs better than available pattern detection implementations on
our data, and that it can also be used to combine features from multiple
sensors resulting in better accuracy than using any single sensor. Since
previous work on pattern detection in time-series has been in the single series
context, we also present results using our technique on multiple standard
time-series datasets and show that it is the most versatile in terms of how it
ranks compared to other published results."
"It is described why multiple refinements with each negative counterexample
does not improve the complexity of the AFP Algorithm. Also Canonical normal
formulas for Horn functions are discussed."
"Traditionally, Multi-task Learning (MTL) models optimize the average of
task-related objective functions, which is an intuitive approach and which we
will be referring to as Average MTL. However, a more general framework,
referred to as Conic MTL, can be formulated by considering conic combinations
of the objective functions instead; in this framework, Average MTL arises as a
special case, when all combination coefficients equal 1. Although the advantage
of Conic MTL over Average MTL has been shown experimentally in previous works,
no theoretical justification has been provided to date. In this paper, we
derive a generalization bound for the Conic MTL method, and demonstrate that
the tightest bound is not necessarily achieved, when all combination
coefficients equal 1; hence, Average MTL may not always be the optimal choice,
and it is important to consider Conic MTL. As a byproduct of the generalization
bound, it also theoretically explains the good experimental results of previous
relevant works. Finally, we propose a new Conic MTL model, whose conic
combination coefficients minimize the generalization bound, instead of choosing
them heuristically as has been done in previous methods. The rationale and
advantage of our model is demonstrated and verified via a series of experiments
by comparing with several other methods."
"We study the distributed computing setting in which there are multiple
servers, each holding a set of points, who wish to compute functions on the
union of their point sets. A key task in this setting is Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), in which the servers would like to compute a low dimensional
subspace capturing as much of the variance of the union of their point sets as
possible. Given a procedure for approximate PCA, one can use it to
approximately solve $\ell_2$-error fitting problems such as $k$-means
clustering and subspace clustering. The essential properties of an approximate
distributed PCA algorithm are its communication cost and computational
efficiency for a given desired accuracy in downstream applications. We give new
algorithms and analyses for distributed PCA which lead to improved
communication and computational costs for $k$-means clustering and related
problems. Our empirical study on real world data shows a speedup of orders of
magnitude, preserving communication with only a negligible degradation in
solution quality. Some of these techniques we develop, such as a general
transformation from a constant success probability subspace embedding to a high
success probability subspace embedding with a dimension and sparsity
independent of the success probability, may be of independent interest."
"Although multi-label learning can deal with many problems with label
ambiguity, it does not fit some real applications well where the overall
distribution of the importance of the labels matters. This paper proposes a
novel learning paradigm named \emph{label distribution learning} (LDL) for such
kind of applications. The label distribution covers a certain number of labels,
representing the degree to which each label describes the instance. LDL is a
more general learning framework which includes both single-label and
multi-label learning as its special cases. This paper proposes six working LDL
algorithms in three ways: problem transformation, algorithm adaptation, and
specialized algorithm design. In order to compare the performance of the LDL
algorithms, six representative and diverse evaluation measures are selected via
a clustering analysis, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are
collected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial
and fifteen real-world datasets show clear advantages of the specialized
algorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the
characteristics of the LDL problem."
"This paper describes the solution of Bazinga Team for Tmall Recommendation
Prize 2014. With real-world user action data provided by Tmall, one of the
largest B2C online retail platforms in China, this competition requires to
predict future user purchases on Tmall website. Predictions are judged on
F1Score, which considers both precision and recall for fair evaluation. The
data set provided by Tmall contains more than half billion action records from
over ten million distinct users. Such massive data volume poses a big
challenge, and drives competitors to write every single program in MapReduce
fashion and run it on distributed cluster. We model the purchase prediction
problem as standard machine learning problem, and mainly employ regression and
classification methods as single models. Individual models are then aggregated
in a two-stage approach, using linear regression for blending, and finally a
linear ensemble of blended models. The competition is approaching the end but
still in running during writing this paper. In the end, our team achieves
F1Score 6.11 and ranks 7th (out of 7,276 teams in total)."
"In this paper, we study the generalization performance of regularized
multi-task learning (RMTL) in a vector-valued framework, where MTL is
considered as a learning process for vector-valued functions. We are mainly
concerned with two theoretical questions: 1) under what conditions does RMTL
perform better with a smaller task sample size than STL? 2) under what
conditions is RMTL generalizable and can guarantee the consistency of each task
during simultaneous learning?
  In particular, we investigate two types of task-group relatedness: the
observed discrepancy-dependence measure (ODDM) and the empirical
discrepancy-dependence measure (EDDM), both of which detect the dependence
between two groups of multiple related tasks (MRTs). We then introduce the
Cartesian product-based uniform entropy number (CPUEN) to measure the
complexities of vector-valued function classes. By applying the specific
deviation and the symmetrization inequalities to the vector-valued framework,
we obtain the generalization bound for RMTL, which is the upper bound of the
joint probability of the event that there is at least one task with a large
empirical discrepancy between the expected and empirical risks. Finally, we
present a sufficient condition to guarantee the consistency of each task in the
simultaneous learning process, and we discuss how task relatedness affects the
generalization performance of RMTL. Our theoretical findings answer the
aforementioned two questions."
"Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are amongst the best performing
models for structured computer vision tasks, such as semantic image
segmentation or human pose estimation. Training SSVMs, however, is
computationally costly, because it requires repeated calls to a structured
prediction subroutine (called \emph{max-oracle}), which has to solve an
optimization problem itself, e.g. a graph cut.
  In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for SSVM training that is more
efficient than earlier techniques when the max-oracle is computationally
expensive, as it is frequently the case in computer vision tasks. The main idea
is to (i) combine the recent stochastic Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm
with efficient hyperplane caching, and (ii) use an automatic selection rule for
deciding whether to call the exact max-oracle or to rely on an approximate one
based on the cached hyperplanes.
  We show experimentally that this strategy leads to faster convergence to the
optimum with respect to the number of requires oracle calls, and that this
translates into faster convergence with respect to the total runtime when the
max-oracle is slow compared to the other steps of the algorithm.
  A publicly available C++ implementation is provided at
http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/papers/SVM.html ."
"The Volterra series can be used to model a large subset of nonlinear, dynamic
systems. A major drawback is the number of coefficients required model such
systems. In order to reduce the number of required coefficients, Laguerre
polynomials are used to estimate the Volterra kernels. Existing literature
proposes algorithms for a fixed number of Volterra kernels, and Laguerre
series. This paper presents a novel algorithm for generalized calculation of
the finite order Volterra-Laguerre (VL) series for a MIMO system. An example
addresses the utility of the algorithm in practical application."
"We consider a setting where a system learns to rank a fixed set of $m$ items.
The goal is produce good item rankings for users with diverse interests who
interact online with the system for $T$ rounds. We consider a novel top-$1$
feedback model: at the end of each round, the relevance score for only the top
ranked object is revealed. However, the performance of the system is judged on
the entire ranked list. We provide a comprehensive set of results regarding
learnability under this challenging setting. For PairwiseLoss and DCG, two
popular ranking measures, we prove that the minimax regret is
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$. Moreover, the minimax regret is achievable using an
efficient strategy that only spends $O(m \log m)$ time per round. The same
efficient strategy achieves $O(T^{2/3})$ regret for Precision@$k$.
Surprisingly, we show that for normalized versions of these ranking measures,
i.e., AUC, NDCG \& MAP, no online ranking algorithm can have sublinear regret."
"Stochastic discriminative EM (sdEM) is an online-EM-type algorithm for
discriminative training of probabilistic generative models belonging to the
exponential family. In this work, we introduce and justify this algorithm as a
stochastic natural gradient descent method, i.e. a method which accounts for
the information geometry in the parameter space of the statistical model. We
show how this learning algorithm can be used to train probabilistic generative
models by minimizing different discriminative loss functions, such as the
negative conditional log-likelihood and the Hinge loss. The resulting models
trained by sdEM are always generative (i.e. they define a joint probability
distribution) and, in consequence, allows to deal with missing data and latent
variables in a principled way either when being learned or when making
predictions. The performance of this method is illustrated by several text
classification problems for which a multinomial naive Bayes and a latent
Dirichlet allocation based classifier are learned using different
discriminative loss functions."
"Inthischapterwediscusshowtolearnanoptimalmanifoldpresentationto regularize
nonegative matrix factorization (NMF) for data representation problems.
NMF,whichtriestorepresentanonnegativedatamatrixasaproductoftwolowrank
nonnegative matrices, has been a popular method for data representation due to
its ability to explore the latent part-based structure of data. Recent study
shows that lots of data distributions have manifold structures, and we should
respect the manifold structure when the data are represented. Recently,
manifold regularized NMF used a nearest neighbor graph to regulate the learning
of factorization parameter matrices and has shown its advantage over
traditional NMF methods for data representation problems. However, how to
construct an optimal graph to present the manifold prop- erly remains a
difficultproblem due to the graph modelselection, noisy features, and nonlinear
distributed data. In this chapter, we introduce three effective methods to
solve these problems of graph construction for manifold regularized NMF.
Multiple graph learning is proposed to solve the problem of graph model
selection, adaptive graph learning via feature selection is proposed to solve
the problem of constructing a graph from noisy features, while multi-kernel
learning-based graph construction is used to solve the problem of learning a
graph from nonlinearly distributed data."
"Conditional random fields (CRFs) are usually specified by graphical models
but in this paper we propose to use probabilistic logic programs and specify
them generatively. Our intension is first to provide a unified approach to CRFs
for complex modeling through the use of a Turing complete language and second
to offer a convenient way of realizing generative-discriminative pairs in
machine learning to compare generative and discriminative models and choose the
best model. We implemented our approach as the D-PRISM language by modifying
PRISM, a logic-based probabilistic modeling language for generative modeling,
while exploiting its dynamic programming mechanism for efficient probability
computation. We tested D-PRISM with logistic regression, a linear-chain CRF and
a CRF-CFG and empirically confirmed their excellent discriminative performance
compared to their generative counterparts, i.e.\ naive Bayes, an HMM and a
PCFG. We also introduced new CRF models, CRF-BNCs and CRF-LCGs. They are CRF
versions of Bayesian network classifiers and probabilistic left-corner grammars
respectively and easily implementable in D-PRISM. We empirically showed that
they outperform their generative counterparts as expected."
"Sparse-Group Lasso (SGL) has been shown to be a powerful regression technique
for simultaneously discovering group and within-group sparse patterns by using
a combination of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms. However, in large-scale
applications, the complexity of the regularizers entails great computational
challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Layer Feature REduction
method (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The
two-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the
inactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the
sparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing
feature reduction methods are only applicable for sparse models with one
sparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one
that is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers.
Moreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with
any existing solvers. We also develop a screening method---called DPC
(DecomPosition of Convex set)---for the nonnegative Lasso problem. Experiments
on both synthetic and real data sets show that TLFre and DPC improve the
efficiency of SGL and nonnegative Lasso by several orders of magnitude."
"The capacity of a learning machine is measured by its Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension, and learning machines with a low VC dimension generalize better. It
is well known that the VC dimension of SVMs can be very large or unbounded,
even though they generally yield state-of-the-art learning performance. In this
paper, we show how to learn a hyperplane regressor by minimizing an exact, or
\boldmath{$\Theta$} bound on its VC dimension. The proposed approach, termed as
the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) Regressor, involves solving a simple
linear programming problem. Experimental results show, that on a number of
benchmark datasets, the proposed approach yields regressors with error rates
much less than those obtained with conventional SVM regresssors, while often
using fewer support vectors. On some benchmark datasets, the number of support
vectors is less than one tenth the number used by SVMs, indicating that the MCM
does indeed learn simpler representations."
"Naive Bayes classifiers, a family of classifiers that are based on the
popular Bayes' probability theorem, are known for creating simple yet well
performing models, especially in the fields of document classification and
disease prediction. In this article, we will look at the main concepts of naive
Bayes classification in the context of document categorization."

"In machine learning and pattern recognition, feature selection has been a hot
topic in the literature. Unsupervised feature selection is challenging due to
the loss of labels which would supply the related information.How to define an
appropriate metric is the key for feature selection. We propose a filter method
for unsupervised feature selection which is based on the Confidence Machine.
Confidence Machine offers an estimation of confidence on a feature'reliability.
In this paper, we provide the math model of Confidence Machine in the context
of feature selection, which maximizes the relevance and minimizes the
redundancy of the selected feature. We compare our method against classic
feature selection methods Laplacian Score, Pearson Correlation and Principal
Component Analysis on benchmark data sets. The experimental results demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our method."
"In this paper, we describe a new vector similarity measure associated with a
convex cost function. Given two vectors, we determine the surface normals of
the convex function at the vectors. The angle between the two surface normals
is the similarity measure. Convex cost function can be the negative entropy
function, total variation (TV) function and filtered variation function. The
convex cost function need not be differentiable everywhere. In general, we need
to compute the gradient of the cost function to compute the surface normals. If
the gradient does not exist at a given vector, it is possible to use the
subgradients and the normal producing the smallest angle between the two
vectors is used to compute the similarity measure."
"We consider supervised learning with random decision trees, where the tree
construction is completely random. The method is popularly used and works well
in practice despite the simplicity of the setting, but its statistical
mechanism is not yet well-understood. In this paper we provide strong
theoretical guarantees regarding learning with random decision trees. We
analyze and compare three different variants of the algorithm that have minimal
memory requirements: majority voting, threshold averaging and probabilistic
averaging. The random structure of the tree enables us to adapt these methods
to a differentially-private setting thus we also propose differentially-private
versions of all three schemes. We give upper-bounds on the generalization error
and mathematically explain how the accuracy depends on the number of random
decision trees. Furthermore, we prove that only logarithmic (in the size of the
dataset) number of independently selected random decision trees suffice to
correctly classify most of the data, even when differential-privacy guarantees
must be maintained. We empirically show that majority voting and threshold
averaging give the best accuracy, also for conservative users requiring high
privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a simple majority voting
rule is an especially good candidate for the differentially-private classifier
since it is much less sensitive to the choice of forest parameters than other
methods."
"In this paper, we compare three initialization schemes for the KMEANS
clustering algorithm: 1) random initialization (KMEANSRAND), 2) KMEANS++, and
3) KMEANSD++. Both KMEANSRAND and KMEANS++ have a major that the value of k
needs to be set by the user of the algorithms. (Kang 2013) recently proposed a
novel use of determinantal point processes for sampling the initial centroids
for the KMEANS algorithm (we call it KMEANSD++). They, however, do not provide
any evaluation establishing that KMEANSD++ is better than other algorithms. In
this paper, we show that the performance of KMEANSD++ is comparable to KMEANS++
(both of which are better than KMEANSRAND) with KMEANSD++ having an additional
that it can automatically approximate the value of k."
"Feature selection involes identifying the most relevant subset of input
features, with a view to improving generalization of predictive models by
reducing overfitting. Directly searching for the most relevant combination of
attributes is NP-hard. Variable selection is of critical importance in many
applications, such as micro-array data analysis, where selecting a small number
of discriminative features is crucial to developing useful models of disease
mechanisms, as well as for prioritizing targets for drug discovery. The
recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) provides a way to learn a
hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact (\boldmath{$\Theta$}) bound on its
VC dimension. It is well known that a lower VC dimension contributes to good
generalization. For a linear hyperplane classifier in the input space, the VC
dimension is upper bounded by the number of features; hence, a linear
classifier with a small VC dimension is parsimonious in the set of features it
employs. In this paper, we use the linear MCM to learn a classifier in which a
large number of weights are zero; features with non-zero weights are the ones
that are chosen. Selected features are used to learn a kernel SVM classifier.
On a number of benchmark datasets, the features chosen by the linear MCM yield
comparable or better test set accuracy than when methods such as ReliefF and
FCBF are used for the task. The linear MCM typically chooses one-tenth the
number of attributes chosen by the other methods; on some very high dimensional
datasets, the MCM chooses about $0.6\%$ of the features; in comparison, ReliefF
and FCBF choose 70 to 140 times more features, thus demonstrating that
minimizing the VC dimension may provide a new, and very effective route for
feature selection and for learning sparse representations."
"A Relational Dependency Network (RDN) is a directed graphical model widely
used for multi-relational data. These networks allow cyclic dependencies,
necessary to represent relational autocorrelations. We describe an approach for
learning both the RDN's structure and its parameters, given an input relational
database: First learn a Bayesian network (BN), then transform the Bayesian
network to an RDN. Thus fast Bayes net learning can provide fast RDN learning.
The BN-to-RDN transform comprises a simple, local adjustment of the Bayes net
structure and a closed-form transform of the Bayes net parameters. This method
can learn an RDN for a dataset with a million tuples in minutes. We empirically
compare our approach to state-of-the art RDN learning methods that use
functional gradient boosting, on five benchmark datasets. Learning RDNs via BNs
scales much better to large datasets than learning RDNs with boosting, and
provides competitive accuracy in predictions."
"Standard Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems assume that the arms are
independent. However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained
by playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence,
in such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to
enable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce
and formalize the Global MAB (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative
through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all
the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm
with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded
parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only
finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the
optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability
one. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each
other's rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the
parameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the
informativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk
bound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for
linearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. GMABs have
applications ranging from drug and treatment discovery to dynamic pricing."
"Estimating the parameters of probabilistic models of language such as maxent
models and probabilistic neural models is computationally difficult since it
involves evaluating partition functions by summing over an entire vocabulary,
which may be millions of word types in size. Two closely related
strategies---noise contrastive estimation (Mnih and Teh, 2012; Mnih and
Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Vaswani et al., 2013) and negative sampling (Mikolov et al.,
2012; Goldberg and Levy, 2014)---have emerged as popular solutions to this
computational problem, but some confusion remains as to which is more
appropriate and when. This document explicates their relationships to each
other and to other estimation techniques. The analysis shows that, although
they are superficially similar, NCE is a general parameter estimation technique
that is asymptotically unbiased, while negative sampling is best understood as
a family of binary classification models that are useful for learning word
representations but not as a general-purpose estimator."
"We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional
densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is
based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a
distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear
deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent
space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution,
i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this
transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform
is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear
transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a
deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood,
which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this
approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used
for inpainting."
"This work concerns learning probabilistic models for ranking data in a
heterogeneous population. The specific problem we study is learning the
parameters of a Mallows Mixture Model. Despite being widely studied, current
heuristics for this problem do not have theoretical guarantees and can get
stuck in bad local optima. We present the first polynomial time algorithm which
provably learns the parameters of a mixture of two Mallows models. A key
component of our algorithm is a novel use of tensor decomposition techniques to
learn the top-k prefix in both the rankings. Before this work, even the
question of identifiability in the case of a mixture of two Mallows models was
unresolved."
"We present Factorbird, a prototype of a parameter server approach for
factorizing large matrices with Stochastic Gradient Descent-based algorithms.
We designed Factorbird to meet the following desiderata: (a) scalability to
tall and wide matrices with dozens of billions of non-zeros, (b) extensibility
to different kinds of models and loss functions as long as they can be
optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and (c) adaptability to both
batch and streaming scenarios. Factorbird uses a parameter server in order to
scale to models that exceed the memory of an individual machine, and employs
lock-free Hogwild!-style learning with a special partitioning scheme to
drastically reduce conflicting updates. We also discuss other aspects of the
design of our system such as how to efficiently grid search for hyperparameters
at scale. We present experiments of Factorbird on a matrix built from a subset
of Twitter's interaction graph, consisting of more than 38 billion non-zeros
and about 200 million rows and columns, which is to the best of our knowledge
the largest matrix on which factorization results have been reported in the
literature."
"CUR matrix decomposition computes the low rank approximation of a given
matrix by using the actual rows and columns of the matrix. It has been a very
useful tool for handling large matrices. One limitation with the existing
algorithms for CUR matrix decomposition is that they need an access to the {\it
full} matrix, a requirement that can be difficult to fulfill in many real world
applications. In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a CUR
decomposition algorithm for partially observed matrices. In particular, the
proposed algorithm computes the low rank approximation of the target matrix
based on (i) the randomly sampled rows and columns, and (ii) a subset of
observed entries that are randomly sampled from the matrix. Our analysis shows
the relative error bound, measured by spectral norm, for the proposed algorithm
when the target matrix is of full rank. We also show that only $O(n r\ln r)$
observed entries are needed by the proposed algorithm to perfectly recover a
rank $r$ matrix of size $n\times n$, which improves the sample complexity of
the existing algorithms for matrix completion. Empirical studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets verify our theoretical claims and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
"In this paper, we generalize the eigendecomposition of quadratic forms
(symmetric matrices) to a broad class of ""orthogonally decomposable"" functions.
We focus on extending two characterizations of eigenvectors: First, that the
eigenvectors of a quadratic form arise from the optima structure of the
quadratic form on the sphere, and second that the eigenvectors are the fixed
points of the matrix power iteration. We identify a key role of convexity in
extending these characterizations to our setting. The generalized power
iteration is a simple first order method which we call gradient iteration.
Further, our framework captures as special cases recent methods for inferential
problems in machine learning in areas including orthogonal tensor
decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), topic modeling, spectral
clustering, and Gaussian mixture learning.
  We provide a complete theoretical analysis of gradient iteration using the
structure theory of discrete dynamical systems to show almost sure convergence
and fast (super-linear) convergence rates. The analysis extends to the case
when the observed function is only approximately orthogonally decomposable,
with bounds that are polynomial in dimension and other relevant parameters,
such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be considered as a
non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for perturbations of
eigenvectors of symmetric matrices."
"We provide a general framework for computing lower-bounds on the sample
complexity of recovering the underlying graphs of Ising models, given i.i.d
samples. While there have been recent results for specific graph classes, these
involve fairly extensive technical arguments that are specialized to each
specific graph class. In contrast, we isolate two key graph-structural
ingredients that can then be used to specify sample complexity lower-bounds.
Presence of these structural properties makes the graph class hard to learn. We
derive corollaries of our main result that not only recover existing recent
results, but also provide lower bounds for novel graph classes not considered
previously. We also extend our framework to the random graph setting and derive
corollaries for Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs in a certain dense setting."
"It has been a long-standing goal in machine learning, as well as in AI more
generally, to develop life-long learning systems that learn many different
tasks over time, and reuse insights from tasks learned, ""learning to learn"" as
they do so. In this work we pose and provide efficient algorithms for several
natural theoretical formulations of this goal. Specifically, we consider the
problem of learning many different target functions over time, that share
certain commonalities that are initially unknown to the learning algorithm. Our
aim is to learn new internal representations as the algorithm learns new target
functions, that capture this commonality and allow subsequent learning tasks to
be solved more efficiently and from less data. We develop efficient algorithms
for two very different kinds of commonalities that target functions might
share: one based on learning common low-dimensional and unions of
low-dimensional subspaces and one based on learning nonlinear Boolean
combinations of features. Our algorithms for learning Boolean feature
combinations additionally have a dual interpretation, and can be viewed as
giving an efficient procedure for constructing near-optimal sparse Boolean
autoencoders under a natural ""anchor-set"" assumption."
"We investigate the problem of incorporating higher-level symbolic score-like
information into Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) systems to improve their
performance. We use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants as
music language models (MLMs) and present a generative architecture for
combining these models with predictions from a frame level acoustic classifier.
We also compare different neural network architectures for acoustic modeling.
The proposed model computes a distribution over possible output sequences given
the acoustic input signal and we present an algorithm for performing a global
search for good candidate transcriptions. The performance of the proposed model
is evaluated on piano music from the MAPS dataset and we observe that the
proposed model consistently outperforms existing transcription methods."
"A common phenomena in modern recommendation systems is the use of feedback
from one user to infer the `value' of an item to other users. This results in
an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value
have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing
approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items
are small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if
good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with
unstructured content.
  We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of
items and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an `access-graph'
constrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that
the presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible --
however this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage
of the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of `serendipity' in
exploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of
recommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple
policies like Twitter's `Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance.
  From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of `trials' and
`strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the
same order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for
the worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon
settings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph.
Conversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly
sub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal."
"The expected supremum of a Gaussian process indexed by the image of an index
set under a function class is bounded in terms of separate properties of the
index set and the function class. The bound is relevant to the estimation of
nonlinear transformations or the analysis of learning algorithms whenever
hypotheses are chosen from composite classes, as is the case for multi-layer
models."
"We study a new type of K-armed bandit problem where the expected return of
one arm may depend on the returns of other arms. We present a new algorithm for
this general class of problems and show that under certain circumstances it is
possible to achieve finite expected cumulative regret. We also give
problem-dependent lower bounds on the cumulative regret showing that at least
in special cases the new algorithm is nearly optimal."
"Orthogonal greedy learning (OGL) is a stepwise learning scheme that adds a
new atom from a dictionary via the steepest gradient descent and build the
estimator via orthogonal projecting the target function to the space spanned by
the selected atoms in each greedy step. Here, ""greed"" means choosing a new atom
according to the steepest gradient descent principle. OGL then avoids the
overfitting/underfitting by selecting an appropriate iteration number. In this
paper, we point out that the overfitting/underfitting can also be avoided via
redefining ""greed"" in OGL. To this end, we introduce a new greedy metric,
called $\delta$-greedy thresholds, to refine ""greed"" and theoretically verifies
its feasibility. Furthermore, we reveals that such a greedy metric can bring an
adaptive termination rule on the premise of maintaining the prominent learning
performance of OGL. Our results show that the steepest gradient descent is not
the unique greedy metric of OGL and some other more suitable metric may lessen
the hassle of model-selection of OGL."
"Consider a stationary discrete random process with alphabet size d, which is
assumed to be the output process of an unknown stationary Hidden Markov Model
(HMM). Given the joint probabilities of finite length strings of the process,
we are interested in finding a finite state generative model to describe the
entire process. In particular, we focus on two classes of models: HMMs and
quasi-HMMs, which is a strictly larger class of models containing HMMs. In the
main theorem, we show that if the random process is generated by an HMM of
order less or equal than k, and whose transition and observation probability
matrix are in general position, namely almost everywhere on the parameter
space, both the minimal quasi-HMM realization and the minimal HMM realization
can be efficiently computed based on the joint probabilities of all the length
N strings, for N > 4 lceil log_d(k) rceil +1. In this paper, we also aim to
compare and connect the two lines of literature: realization theory of HMMs,
and the recent development in learning latent variable models with tensor
decomposition techniques."
"Clinical trial adaptation refers to any adjustment of the trial protocol
after the onset of the trial. The main goal is to make the process of
introducing new medical interventions to patients more efficient by reducing
the cost and the time associated with evaluating their safety and efficacy. The
principal question is how should adaptation be performed so as to minimize the
chance of distorting the outcome of the trial. We propose a novel method for
achieving this. Unlike previous work our approach focuses on trial adaptation
by sample size adjustment. We adopt a recently proposed stratification
framework based on collected auxiliary data and show that this information
together with the primary measured variables can be used to make a
probabilistically informed choice of the particular sub-group a sample should
be removed from. Experiments on simulated data are used to illustrate the
effectiveness of our method and its application in practice."
"An important use of private data is to build machine learning classifiers.
While there is a burgeoning literature on differentially private classification
algorithms, we find that they are not practical in real applications due to two
reasons. First, existing differentially private classifiers provide poor
accuracy on real world datasets. Second, there is no known differentially
private algorithm for empirically evaluating the private classifier on a
private test dataset.
  In this paper, we develop differentially private algorithms that mirror real
world empirical machine learning workflows. We consider the private classifier
training algorithm as a blackbox. We present private algorithms for selecting
features that are input to the classifier. Though adding a preprocessing step
takes away some of the privacy budget from the actual classification process
(thus potentially making it noisier and less accurate), we show that our novel
preprocessing techniques significantly increase classifier accuracy on three
real-world datasets. We also present the first private algorithms for
empirically constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on a
private test set."
"In the convex optimization approach to online regret minimization, many
methods have been developed to guarantee a $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on regret for
subdifferentiable convex loss functions with bounded subgradients, by using a
reduction to linear loss functions. This suggests that linear loss functions
tend to be the hardest ones to learn against, regardless of the underlying
decision spaces. We investigate this question in a systematic fashion looking
at the interplay between the set of possible moves for both the decision maker
and the adversarial environment. This allows us to highlight sharp distinctive
behaviors about the learnability of piecewise linear loss functions. On the one
hand, when the decision set of the decision maker is a polyhedron, we establish
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds on regret for a large class of piecewise linear
loss functions with important applications in online linear optimization,
repeated zero-sum Stackelberg games, online prediction with side information,
and online two-stage optimization. On the other hand, we exhibit $o(\sqrt{T})$
learning rates, achieved by the Follow-The-Leader algorithm, in online linear
optimization when the boundary of the decision maker's decision set is curved
and when $0$ does not lie in the convex hull of the environment's decision set.
Hence, the curvature of the decision maker's decision set is a determining
factor for the optimal learning rate. These results hold in a completely
adversarial setting."
"In many real-world applications, data are represented by matrices or
high-order tensors. Despite the promising performance, the existing
two-dimensional discriminant analysis algorithms employ a single projection
model to exploit the discriminant information for projection, making the model
less flexible. In this paper, we propose a novel Compound Rank-k Projection
(CRP) algorithm for bilinear analysis. CRP deals with matrices directly without
transforming them into vectors, and it therefore preserves the correlations
within the matrix and decreases the computation complexity. Different from the
existing two dimensional discriminant analysis algorithms, objective function
values of CRP increase monotonically.In addition, CRP utilizes multiple rank-k
projection models to enable a larger search space in which the optimal solution
can be found. In this way, the discriminant ability is enhanced."
"In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised feature selection framework
by mining correlations among multiple tasks and apply it to different
multimedia applications. Instead of independently computing the importance of
features for each task, our algorithm leverages shared knowledge from multiple
related tasks, thus, improving the performance of feature selection. Note that
we build our algorithm on assumption that different tasks share common
structures. The proposed algorithm selects features in a batch mode, by which
the correlations between different features are taken into consideration.
Besides, considering the fact that labeling a large amount of training data in
real world is both time-consuming and tedious, we adopt manifold learning which
exploits both labeled and unlabeled training data for feature space analysis.
Since the objective function is non-smooth and difficult to solve, we propose
an iterative algorithm with fast convergence. Extensive experiments on
different applications demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other
state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms."
"Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to dimensionality
reduction and data pre-processing for different applications in engineering,
biology and social science. Classical PCA and its variants seek for linear
projections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature
representation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very
difficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is
vulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse
principal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature
analysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression
optimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l 2 , 1 -norm minimization
is incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients
sparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model
used in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature,
which in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output
of our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under
the PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative
algorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and
conduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art
unsupervised feature selection algorithms."
"Clustering is an effective technique in data mining to generate groups that
are the matter of interest. Among various clustering approaches, the family of
k-means algorithms and min-cut algorithms gain most popularity due to their
simplicity and efficacy. The classical k-means algorithm partitions a number of
data points into several subsets by iteratively updating the clustering centers
and the associated data points. By contrast, a weighted undirected graph is
constructed in min-cut algorithms which partition the vertices of the graph
into two sets. However, existing clustering algorithms tend to cluster minority
of data points into a subset, which shall be avoided when the target dataset is
balanced. To achieve more accurate clustering for balanced dataset, we propose
to leverage exclusive lasso on k-means and min-cut to regulate the balance
degree of the clustering results. By optimizing our objective functions that
build atop the exclusive lasso, we can make the clustering result as much
balanced as possible. Extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets
validate the advantage of the proposed algorithms compared to the
state-of-the-art clustering algorithms."
"Spectral clustering is a key research topic in the field of machine learning
and data mining. Most of the existing spectral clustering algorithms are built
upon Gaussian Laplacian matrices, which are sensitive to parameters. We propose
a novel parameter free, distance consistent Locally Linear Embedding. The
proposed distance consistent LLE promises that edges between closer data points
have greater weight.Furthermore, we propose a novel improved spectral
clustering via embedded label propagation. Our algorithm is built upon two
advancements of the state of the art:1) label propagation,which propagates a
node\'s labels to neighboring nodes according to their proximity; and 2)
manifold learning, which has been widely used in its capacity to leverage the
manifold structure of data points. First we perform standard spectral
clustering on original data and assign each cluster to k nearest data points.
Next, we propagate labels through dense, unlabeled data regions. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the superiority of the proposed
algorithm compared to current state of the art spectral algorithms."
"While there are many studies on weight regularization, the study on structure
regularization is rare. Many existing systems on structured prediction focus on
increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model. However, this
trend could have been misdirected, because our study suggests that complex
structures are actually harmful to generalization ability in structured
prediction. To control structure-based overfitting, we propose a structure
regularization framework via \emph{structure decomposition}, which decomposes
training samples into mini-samples with simpler structures, deriving a model
with better generalization power. We show both theoretically and empirically
that structure regularization can effectively control overfitting risk and lead
to better accuracy. As a by-product, the proposed method can also substantially
accelerate the training speed. The method and the theoretical results can apply
to general graphical models with arbitrary structures. Experiments on
well-known tasks demonstrate that our method can easily beat the benchmark
systems on those highly-competitive tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracies yet with substantially faster training speed."
"We study revenue optimization learning algorithms for posted-price auctions
with strategic buyers. We analyze a very broad family of monotone regret
minimization algorithms for this problem, which includes the previously best
known algorithm, and show that no algorithm in that family admits a strategic
regret more favorable than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$. We then introduce a new
algorithm that achieves a strategic regret differing from the lower bound only
by a factor in $O(\log T)$, an exponential improvement upon the previous best
algorithm. Our new algorithm admits a natural analysis and simpler proofs, and
the ideas behind its design are general. We also report the results of
empirical evaluations comparing our algorithm with the previous state of the
art and show a consistent exponential improvement in several different
scenarios."
"Spectral clustering is a fundamental technique in the field of data mining
and information processing. Most existing spectral clustering algorithms
integrate dimensionality reduction into the clustering process assisted by
manifold learning in the original space. However, the manifold in
reduced-dimensional subspace is likely to exhibit altered properties in
contrast with the original space. Thus, applying manifold information obtained
from the original space to the clustering process in a low-dimensional subspace
is prone to inferior performance. Aiming to address this issue, we propose a
novel convex algorithm that mines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional
subspace. In addition, our unified learning process makes the manifold learning
particularly tailored for the clustering. Compared with other related methods,
the proposed algorithm results in more structured clustering result. To
validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets in comparison with some
state-of-the-art clustering approaches. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm has quite promising clustering performance."
"The growing amount of high dimensional data in different machine learning
applications requires more efficient and scalable optimization algorithms. In
this work, we consider combining two techniques, parallelism and Nesterov's
acceleration, to design faster algorithms for L1-regularized loss. We first
simplify BOOM, a variant of gradient descent, and study it in a unified
framework, which allows us to not only propose a refined measurement of
sparsity to improve BOOM, but also show that BOOM is provably slower than
FISTA. Moving on to parallel coordinate descent methods, we then propose an
efficient accelerated version of Shotgun, improving the convergence rate from
$O(1/t)$ to $O(1/t^2)$. Our algorithm enjoys a concise form and analysis
compared to previous work, and also allows one to study several connected work
in a unified way."
"In this paper, we propose an efficient semidefinite programming (SDP)
approach to worst-case linear discriminant analysis (WLDA). Compared with the
traditional LDA, WLDA considers the dimensionality reduction problem from the
worst-case viewpoint, which is in general more robust for classification.
However, the original problem of WLDA is non-convex and difficult to optimize.
In this paper, we reformulate the optimization problem of WLDA into a sequence
of semidefinite feasibility problems. To efficiently solve the semidefinite
feasibility problems, we design a new scalable optimization method with
quasi-Newton methods and eigen-decomposition being the core components. The
proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than standard interior-point
based SDP solvers.
  Experiments on a variety of classification problems demonstrate that our
approach achieves better performance than standard LDA. Our method is also much
faster and more scalable than standard interior-point SDP solvers based WLDA.
The computational complexity for an SDP with $m$ constraints and matrices of
size $d$ by $d$ is roughly reduced from $\mathcal{O}(m^3+md^3+m^2d^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ ($m>d$ in our case)."
"This report discusses two new indices for comparing clusterings of a set of
points. The motivation for looking at new ways for comparing clusterings stems
from the fact that the existing clustering indices are based on set cardinality
alone and do not consider the positions of data points. The new indices,
namely, the Random Walk index (RWI) and Variation of Information with Neighbors
(VIN), are both inspired by the clustering metric Variation of Information
(VI). VI possesses some interesting theoretical properties which are also
desirable in a metric for comparing clusterings. We define our indices and
discuss some of their explored properties which appear relevant for a
clustering index. We also include the results of these indices on clusterings
of some example data sets."
"Matrix factorization is a popular approach for large-scale matrix completion.
The optimization formulation based on matrix factorization can be solved very
efficiently by standard algorithms in practice. However, due to the
non-convexity caused by the factorization model, there is a limited theoretical
understanding of this formulation. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
guarantee for the factorization formulation to correctly recover the underlying
low-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to those
in previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge to the global
optima of a factorization formulation, and recover the true low-rank matrix. We
study the local geometry of a properly regularized factorization formulation
and prove that any stationary point in a certain local region is globally
optimal. A major difference of our work from the existing results is that we do
not need resampling in either the algorithm or its analysis. Compared to other
works on nonconvex optimization, one extra difficulty lies in analyzing
nonconvex constrained optimization when the constraint (or the corresponding
regularizer) is not ""consistent"" with the gradient direction. One technical
contribution is the perturbation analysis for non-symmetric matrix
factorization."
"We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of a
simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the
Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i)
variable independence, ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii)
uniformity. These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully
decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix
theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical
values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are
located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number
of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the
network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar
behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies
in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge
to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there
are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a
major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter
poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered.
Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the
network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum
often leads to overfitting."

"In this work we consider the learning setting where, in addition to the
training set, the learner receives a collection of auxiliary hypotheses
originating from other tasks. We focus on a broad class of ERM-based linear
algorithms that can be instantiated with any non-negative smooth loss function
and any strongly convex regularizer. We establish generalization and excess
risk bounds, showing that, if the algorithm is fed with a good combination of
source hypotheses, generalization happens at the fast rate $\mathcal{O}(1/m)$
instead of the usual $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{m})$. On the other hand, if the
source hypotheses combination is a misfit for the target task, we recover the
usual learning rate. As a byproduct of our study, we also prove a new bound on
the Rademacher complexity of the smooth loss class under weaker assumptions
compared to previous works."
"The problem of automatically clustering data is an age old problem. People
have created numerous algorithms to tackle this problem. The execution time of
any of this algorithm grows with the number of input points and the number of
cluster centers required. To reduce the number of input points we could average
the points locally and use the means or the local centers as the input for
clustering. However since the required number of local centers is very high,
running the clustering algorithm on the entire dataset to obtain these
representational points is very time consuming. To remedy this problem, in this
paper we are proposing two subclustering schemes where by we subdivide the
dataset into smaller sets and run the clustering algorithm on the smaller
datasets to obtain the required number of datapoints to run our clustering
algorithm with. As we are subdividing the given dataset, we could run
clustering algorithm on each smaller piece of the dataset in parallel. We found
that both parallel and serial execution of this method to be much faster than
the original clustering algorithm and error in running the clustering algorithm
on a reduced set to be very less."
"In this paper, we theoretically justify an approach popular among
participants of the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge to optimize
approximate median significance (AMS). The approach is based on the following
two-stage procedure. First, a real-valued function is learned by minimizing a
surrogate loss for binary classification, such as logistic loss, on the
training sample. Then, a threshold is tuned on a separate validation sample, by
direct optimization of AMS. We show that the regret of the resulting
(thresholded) classifier measured with respect to the squared AMS, is
upperbounded by the regret of the underlying real-valued function measured with
respect to the logistic loss. Hence, we prove that minimizing logistic
surrogate is a consistent method of optimizing AMS."
"In this report, we describe a Theano-based AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)
implementation and its naive data parallelism on multiple GPUs. Our performance
on 2 GPUs is comparable with the state-of-art Caffe library (Jia et al., 2014)
run on 1 GPU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source
Python-based AlexNet implementation to-date."
"A widely-used tool for binary classification is the Support Vector Machine
(SVM), a supervised learning technique that finds the ""maximum margin"" linear
separator between the two classes. While SVMs have been well studied in the
batch (offline) setting, there is considerably less work on the streaming
(online) setting, which requires only a single pass over the data using
sub-linear space. Existing streaming algorithms are not yet competitive with
the batch implementation. In this paper, we use the formulation of the SVM as a
minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem to provide a streaming SVM algorithm based
off of the blurred ball cover originally proposed by Agarwal and Sharathkumar.
Our implementation consistently outperforms existing streaming SVM approaches
and provides higher accuracies than libSVM on several datasets, thus making it
competitive with the standard SVM batch implementation."
"Deep learning has attracted great attention recently and yielded the state of
the art performance in dimension reduction and classification problems.
However, it cannot effectively handle the structured output prediction, e.g.
sequential labeling. In this paper, we propose a deep learning structure, which
can learn discriminative features for sequential labeling problems. More
specifically, we add the inter-relationship between labels in our deep learning
structure, in order to incorporate the context information from the sequential
data. Thus, our model is more powerful than linear Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) because the objective function learns latent non-linear features so that
target labeling can be better predicted. We pretrain the deep structure with
stacked restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) for feature learning and optimize
our objective function with online learning algorithm, a mixture of perceptron
training and stochastic gradient descent. We test our model on different
challenge tasks, and show that our model outperforms significantly over the
completive baselines."
"The purpose of this report is in examining the generalization performance of
Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a tool for pattern recognition and object
classification. The work is motivated by the growing popularity of the method
that is claimed to guarantee a good generalization performance for the task in
hand. The method is implemented in MATLAB. SVMs based on various kernels are
tested for classifying data from various domains."
"In this paper, we propose a new max-margin based discriminative feature
learning method. Specifically, we aim at learning a low-dimensional feature
representation, so as to maximize the global margin of the data and make the
samples from the same class as close as possible. In order to enhance the
robustness to noise, a $l_{2,1}$ norm constraint is introduced to make the
transformation matrix in group sparsity. In addition, for multi-class
classification tasks, we further intend to learn and leverage the correlation
relationships among multiple class tasks for assisting in learning
discriminative features. The experimental results demonstrate the power of the
proposed method against the related state-of-the-art methods."
"We consider learning from data of variable quality that may be obtained from
different heterogeneous sources. Addressing learning from heterogeneous data in
its full generality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we adopt instead a
model in which data is observed through heterogeneous noise, where the noise
level reflects the quality of the data source. We study how to use stochastic
gradient algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two
concrete examples where this problem arises naturally: learning with local
differential privacy based on data from multiple sources with different privacy
requirements, and learning from data with labels of variable quality.
  The main contribution of this paper is to identify how heterogeneous noise
impacts performance. We show that given two datasets with heterogeneous noise,
the order in which to use them in standard SGD depends on the learning rate. We
propose a method for changing the learning rate as a function of the
heterogeneity, and prove new regret bounds for our method in two cases of
interest. Experiments on real data show that our method performs better than
using a single learning rate and using only the less noisy of the two datasets
when the noise level is low to moderate."
"Online multiple-output regression is an important machine learning technique
for modeling, predicting, and compressing multi-dimensional correlated data
streams. In this paper, we propose a novel online multiple-output regression
method, called MORES, for stream data. MORES can \emph{dynamically} learn the
structure of the coefficients change in each update step to facilitate the
model's continuous refinement. We observe that limited expressive ability of
the regression model, especially in the preliminary stage of online update,
often leads to the variables in the residual errors being dependent. In light
of this point, MORES intends to \emph{dynamically} learn and leverage the
structure of the residual errors to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover,
we define three statistical variables to \emph{exactly} represent all the seen
samples for \emph{incrementally} calculating prediction loss in each online
update round, which can avoid loading all the training data into memory for
updating model, and also effectively prevent drastic fluctuation of the model
in the presence of noise. Furthermore, we introduce a forgetting factor to set
different weights on samples so as to track the data streams' evolving
characteristics quickly from the latest samples. Experiments on one synthetic
dataset and three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. In addition, the update speed of MORES is at least 2000
samples processed per second on the three real-world datasets, more than 15
times faster than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithm."
"In large scale machine learning and data mining problems with high feature
dimensionality, the Euclidean distance between data points can be
uninformative, and Distance Metric Learning (DML) is often desired to learn a
proper similarity measure (using side information such as example data pairs
being similar or dissimilar). However, high dimensionality and large volume of
pairwise constraints in modern big data can lead to prohibitive computational
cost for both the original DML formulation in Xing et al. (2002) and later
extensions. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for DML, and a
large-scale implementation on a parameter server architecture. Our approach
builds on a parallelizable reformulation of Xing et al. (2002), and an
asynchronous stochastic gradient descent optimization procedure. To our
knowledge, this is the first distributed solution to DML, and we show that, on
a system with 256 CPU cores, our program is able to complete a DML task on a
dataset with 1 million data points, 22-thousand features, and 200 million
labeled data pairs, in 15 hours; and the learned metric shows great
effectiveness in properly measuring distances."
"The notion of metric plays a key role in machine learning problems such as
classification, clustering or ranking. However, it is worth noting that there
is a severe lack of theoretical guarantees that can be expected on the
generalization capacity of the classifier associated to a given metric. The
theoretical framework of $(\epsilon, \gamma, \tau)$-good similarity functions
(Balcan et al., 2008) has been one of the first attempts to draw a link between
the properties of a similarity function and those of a linear classifier making
use of it. In this paper, we extend and complete this theory by providing a new
generalization bound for the associated classifier based on the algorithmic
robustness framework."
"Many modern multiclass and multilabel problems are characterized by
increasingly large output spaces. For these problems, label embeddings have
been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and
statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank
constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers a
fast label embedding algorithm which works in both the multiclass and
multilabel settings. The result is a randomized algorithm whose running time is
exponentially faster than naive algorithms. We demonstrate our techniques on
two large-scale public datasets, from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text
Challenge and the Open Directory Project, where we obtain state of the art
results."
"We describe a general framework for online adaptation of optimization
hyperparameters by `hot swapping' their values during learning. We investigate
this approach in the context of adaptive learning rate selection using an
explore-exploit strategy from the multi-armed bandit literature. Experiments on
a benchmark neural network show that the hot swapping approach leads to
consistently better solutions compared to well-known alternatives such as
AdaDelta and stochastic gradient with exhaustive hyperparameter search."
"Energy-based models are popular in machine learning due to the elegance of
their formulation and their relationship to statistical physics. Among these,
the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), and its staple training algorithm
contrastive divergence (CD), have been the prototype for some recent
advancements in the unsupervised training of deep neural networks. However, CD
has limited theoretical motivation, and can in some cases produce undesirable
behavior. Here, we investigate the performance of Minimum Probability Flow
(MPF) learning for training RBMs. Unlike CD, with its focus on approximating an
intractable partition function via Gibbs sampling, MPF proposes a tractable,
consistent, objective function defined in terms of a Taylor expansion of the KL
divergence with respect to sampling dynamics. Here we propose a more general
form for the sampling dynamics in MPF, and explore the consequences of
different choices for these dynamics for training RBMs. Experimental results
show MPF outperforming CD for various RBM configurations."
"We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."
"We study the problem of clustering with relative constraints, where each
constraint specifies relative similarities among instances. In particular, each
constraint $(x_i, x_j, x_k)$ is acquired by posing a query: is instance $x_i$
more similar to $x_j$ than to $x_k$? We consider the scenario where answers to
such queries are based on an underlying (but unknown) class concept, which we
aim to discover via clustering. Different from most existing methods that only
consider constraints derived from yes and no answers, we also incorporate don't
know responses. We introduce a Discriminative Clustering method with Relative
Constraints (DCRC) which assumes a natural probabilistic relationship between
instances, their underlying cluster memberships, and the observed constraints.
The objective is to maximize the model likelihood given the constraints, and in
the meantime enforce cluster separation and cluster balance by also making use
of the unlabeled instances. We evaluated the proposed method using constraints
generated from ground-truth class labels, and from (noisy) human judgments from
a user study. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) the usefulness of relative
constraints, in particular when don't know answers are considered; 2) the
improved performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods that
utilize either relative or pairwise constraints; and 3) the robustness of our
method in the presence of noisy constraints, such as those provided by human
judgement."
"Word2vec, as an efficient tool for learning vector representation of words
has shown its effectiveness in many natural language processing tasks. Mikolov
et al. issued Skip-Gram and Negative Sampling model for developing this
toolbox. Perozzi et al. introduced the Skip-Gram model into the study of social
network for the first time, and designed an algorithm named DeepWalk for
learning node embedding on a graph. We prove that the DeepWalk algorithm is
actually factoring a matrix M where each entry M_{ij} is logarithm of the
average probability that node i randomly walks to node j in fix steps."
"We showed in this work how the Hassanat distance metric enhances the
performance of the nearest neighbour classifiers. The results demonstrate the
superiority of this distance metric over the traditional and most-used
distances, such as Manhattan distance and Euclidian distance. Moreover, we
proved that the Hassanat distance metric is invariant to data scale, noise and
outliers. Throughout this work, it is clearly notable that both ENN and IINC
performed very well with the distance investigated, as their accuracy increased
significantly by 3.3% and 3.1% respectively, with no significant advantage of
the ENN over the IINC in terms of accuracy. Correspondingly, it can be noted
from our results that there is no optimal algorithm that can solve all
real-life problems perfectly; this is supported by the no-free-lunch theorem"
"Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an effective model for many classification
problems. However, SVM needs the solution of a quadratic program which require
specialized code. In addition, SVM has many parameters, which affects the
performance of SVM classifier. Recently, the Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal
SVM (GEPSVM) has been presented to solve the SVM complexity. In real world
applications data may affected by error or noise, working with this data is a
challenging problem. In this paper, an approach has been proposed to overcome
this problem. This method is called DSA-GEPSVM. The main improvements are
carried out based on the following: 1) a novel fuzzy values in the linear case.
2) A new Kernel function in the nonlinear case. 3) Differential Search
Algorithm (DSA) is reformulated to find near optimal values of the GEPSVM
parameters and its kernel parameters. The experimental results show that the
proposed approach is able to find the suitable parameter values, and has higher
classification accuracy compared with some other algorithms."
"Learning a kernel matrix from relative comparison human feedback is an
important problem with applications in collaborative filtering, object
retrieval, and search. For learning a kernel over a large number of objects,
existing methods face significant scalability issues inhibiting the application
of these methods to settings where a kernel is learned in an online and timely
fashion. In this paper we propose a novel framework called Efficient online
Relative comparison Kernel LEarning (ERKLE), for efficiently learning the
similarity of a large set of objects in an online manner. We learn a kernel
from relative comparisons via stochastic gradient descent, one query response
at a time, by taking advantage of the sparse and low-rank properties of the
gradient to efficiently restrict the kernel to lie in the space of positive
semidefinite matrices. In addition, we derive a passive-aggressive online
update for minimally satisfying new relative comparisons as to not disrupt the
influence of previously obtained comparisons. Experimentally, we demonstrate a
considerable improvement in speed while obtaining improved or comparable
accuracy compared to current methods in the online learning setting."
"High-content screening uses large collections of unlabeled cell image data to
reason about genetics or cell biology. Two important tasks are to identify
those cells which bear interesting phenotypes, and to identify sub-populations
enriched for these phenotypes. This exploratory data analysis usually involves
dimensionality reduction followed by clustering, in the hope that clusters
represent a phenotype. We propose the use of stacked de-noising auto-encoders
to perform dimensionality reduction for high-content screening. We demonstrate
the superior performance of our approach over PCA, Local Linear Embedding,
Kernel PCA and Isomap."
"In a variety of problems, the number and state of multiple moving targets are
unknown and are subject to be inferred from their measurements obtained by a
sensor with limited sensing ability. This type of problems is raised in a
variety of applications, including monitoring of endangered species, cleaning,
and surveillance. Particle filters are widely used to estimate target state
from its prior information and its measurements that recently become available,
especially for the cases when the measurement model and the prior distribution
of state of interest are non-Gaussian. However, the problem of estimating
number of total targets and their state becomes intractable when the number of
total targets and the measurement-target association are unknown. This paper
presents a novel Gaussian particle filter technique that combines Kalman filter
and particle filter for estimating the number and state of total targets based
on the measurement obtained online. The estimation is represented by a set of
weighted particles, different from classical particle filter, where each
particle is a Gaussian distribution instead of a point mass."
"The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension measures the complexity of a learning
machine, and a low VC dimension leads to good generalization. The recently
proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) learns a hyperplane classifier by
minimizing an exact bound on the VC dimension. This paper extends the MCM
classifier to the fuzzy domain. The use of a fuzzy membership is known to
reduce the effect of outliers, and to reduce the effect of noise on learning.
Experimental results show, that on a number of benchmark datasets, the the
fuzzy MCM classifier outperforms SVMs and the conventional MCM in terms of
generalization, and that the fuzzy MCM uses fewer support vectors. On several
benchmark datasets, the fuzzy MCM classifier yields excellent test set
accuracies while using one-tenth the number of support vectors used by SVMs."
"We propose novel methods for max-cost Discrete Function Evaluation Problem
(DFEP) under budget constraints. We are motivated by applications such as
clinical diagnosis where a patient is subjected to a sequence of (possibly
expensive) tests before a decision is made. Our goal is to develop strategies
for minimizing max-costs. The problem is known to be NP hard and greedy methods
based on specialized impurity functions have been proposed. We develop a broad
class of \emph{admissible} impurity functions that admit monomials, classes of
polynomials, and hinge-loss functions that allow for flexible impurity design
with provably optimal approximation bounds. This flexibility is important for
datasets when max-cost can be overly sensitive to ""outliers."" Outliers bias
max-cost to a few examples that require a large number of tests for
classification. We design admissible functions that allow for accuracy-cost
trade-off and result in $O(\log n)$ guarantees of the optimal cost among trees
with corresponding classification accuracy levels."
"Clustering is an essential problem in machine learning and data mining. One
vital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the
data representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep
learning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of
the art performance in many classification problems, such as character
recognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little
attention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised
clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with
nonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages
the advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension
reduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin
framework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online
efficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep
belief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer
model complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the
advantage of our approach over competitive baselines."
"We consider classification and regression tasks where we have missing data
and assume that the (clean) data resides in a low rank subspace. Finding a
hidden subspace is known to be computationally hard. Nevertheless, using a
non-proper formulation we give an efficient agnostic algorithm that classifies
as good as the best linear classifier coupled with the best low-dimensional
subspace in which the data resides. A direct implication is that our algorithm
can linearly (and non-linearly through kernels) classify provably as well as
the best classifier that has access to the full data."
"Sparsity-inducing penalties are useful tools to design multiclass support
vector machines (SVMs). In this paper, we propose a convex optimization
approach for efficiently and exactly solving the multiclass SVM learning
problem involving a sparse regularization and the multiclass hinge loss
formulated by Crammer and Singer. We provide two algorithms: the first one
dealing with the hinge loss as a penalty term, and the other one addressing the
case when the hinge loss is enforced through a constraint. The related convex
optimization problems can be efficiently solved thanks to the flexibility
offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms and epigraphical splitting
techniques. Experiments carried out on several datasets demonstrate the
interest of considering the exact expression of the hinge loss rather than a
smooth approximation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms w.r.t. several
state-of-the-art methods is also assessed through comparisons of execution
times."
"In this paper, we propose the problem of optimizing multivariate performance
measures from multi-view data, and an effective method to solve it. This
problem has two features: the data points are presented by multiple views, and
the target of learning is to optimize complex multivariate performance
measures. We propose to learn a linear discriminant functions for each view,
and combine them to construct a overall multivariate mapping function for
mult-view data. To learn the parameters of the linear dis- criminant functions
of different views to optimize multivariate performance measures, we formulate
a optimization problem. In this problem, we propose to minimize the complexity
of the linear discriminant functions of each view, encourage the consistences
of the responses of different views over the same data points, and minimize the
upper boundary of a given multivariate performance measure. To optimize this
problem, we employ the cutting-plane method in an iterative algorithm. In each
iteration, we update a set of constrains, and optimize the mapping function
parameter of each view one by one."
"Assuming a view of the Random Forest as a special case of a nested ensemble
of interchangeable modules, we construct a generalisation space allowing one to
easily develop novel methods based on this algorithm. We discuss the role and
required properties of modules at each level, especially in context of some
already proposed RF generalisations."
"In [1], a clustering algorithm was given to find the centers of clusters
quickly. However, the accuracy of this algorithm heavily depend on the
threshold value of d-c. Furthermore, [1] has not provided any efficient way to
select the threshold value of d-c, that is, one can have to estimate the value
of d_c depend on one's subjective experience. In this paper, based on the data
field [2], we propose a new way to automatically extract the threshold value of
d_c from the original data set by using the potential entropy of data field.
For any data set to be clustered, the most reasonable value of d_c can be
objectively calculated from the data set by using our proposed method. The same
experiments in [1] are redone with our proposed method on the same experimental
data set used in [1], the results of which shows that the problem to calculate
the threshold value of d_c in [1] has been solved by using our method."
"In this paper we investigate the usage of regularized correntropy framework
for learning of classifiers from noisy labels. The class label predictors
learned by minimizing transitional loss functions are sensitive to the noisy
and outlying labels of training samples, because the transitional loss
functions are equally applied to all the samples. To solve this problem, we
propose to learn the class label predictors by maximizing the correntropy
between the predicted labels and the true labels of the training samples, under
the regularized Maximum Correntropy Criteria (MCC) framework. Moreover, we
regularize the predictor parameter to control the complexity of the predictor.
The learning problem is formulated by an objective function considering the
parameter regularization and MCC simultaneously. By optimizing the objective
function alternately, we develop a novel predictor learning algorithm. The
experiments on two chal- lenging pattern classification tasks show that it
significantly outperforms the machines with transitional loss functions."
"Most of the existing classification methods are aimed at minimization of
empirical risk (through some simple point-based error measured with loss
function) with added regularization. We propose to approach this problem in a
more information theoretic way by investigating applicability of entropy
measures as a classification model objective function. We focus on quadratic
Renyi's entropy and connected Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence which leads to the
construction of Extreme Entropy Machines (EEM).
  The main contribution of this paper is proposing a model based on the
information theoretic concepts which on the one hand shows new, entropic
perspective on known linear classifiers and on the other leads to a
construction of very robust method competetitive with the state of the art
non-information theoretic ones (including Support Vector Machines and Extreme
Learning Machines).
  Evaluation on numerous problems spanning from small, simple ones from UCI
repository to the large (hundreads of thousands of samples) extremely
unbalanced (up to 100:1 classes' ratios) datasets shows wide applicability of
the EEM in real life problems and that it scales well."
"Semi-supervised clustering is an very important topic in machine learning and
computer vision. The key challenge of this problem is how to learn a metric,
such that the instances sharing the same label are more likely close to each
other on the embedded space. However, little attention has been paid to learn
better representations when the data lie on non-linear manifold. Fortunately,
deep learning has led to great success on feature learning recently. Inspired
by the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive
semi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach. More specifically, given
pairwise constraints, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a
non-linear mapping under maximum margin framework for clustering analysis.
Thus, our model unifies transductive learning, feature learning and maximum
margin techniques in the semi-supervised clustering framework. We pretrain the
deep network structure with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) layer by layer
greedily, and optimize our objective function with gradient descent. By
checking the most violated constraints, our approach updates the model
parameters through error backpropagation, in which deep features are learned
automatically. The experimental results shows that our model is significantly
better than the state of the art on semi-supervised clustering."
"In many applications data is naturally presented in terms of orderings of
some basic elements or symbols. Reasoning about such data requires a notion of
similarity capable of handling sequences of different lengths. In this paper we
describe a family of Mercer kernel functions for such sequentially structured
data. The family is characterized by a decomposable structure in terms of
symbol-level and structure-level similarities, representing a specific
combination of kernels which allows for efficient computation. We provide an
experimental evaluation on sequential classification tasks comparing kernels
from our family of kernels to a state of the art sequence kernel called the
Global Alignment kernel which has been shown to outperform Dynamic Time Warping"
"Support vector machines (SVM) can classify data sets along highly non-linear
decision boundaries because of the kernel-trick. This expressiveness comes at a
price: During test-time, the SVM classifier needs to compute the kernel
inner-product between a test sample and all support vectors. With large
training data sets, the time required for this computation can be substantial.
In this paper, we introduce a post-processing algorithm, which compresses the
learned SVM model by reducing and optimizing support vectors. We evaluate our
algorithm on several medium-scaled real-world data sets, demonstrating that it
maintains high test accuracy while reducing the test-time evaluation cost by
several orders of magnitude---in some cases from hours to seconds. It is fair
to say that most of the work in this paper was previously been invented by
Burges and Sch\""olkopf almost 20 years ago. For most of the time during which
we conducted this research, we were unaware of this prior work. However, in the
past two decades, computing power has increased drastically, and we can
therefore provide empirical insights that were not possible in their original
paper."
"Coronary heart disease (CHD) caused by hardening of artery walls due to
cholesterol known as atherosclerosis is responsible for large number of deaths
world-wide. The disease progression is slow, asymptomatic and may lead to
sudden cardiac arrest, stroke or myocardial infraction. Presently, imaging
techniques are being employed to understand the molecular and metabolic
activity of atherosclerotic plaques to estimate the risk. Though imaging
methods are able to provide some information on plaque metabolism they lack the
required resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this paper we consider
the clinical observations and habits of individuals for predicting the risk
factors of CHD. The identification of risk factors helps in stratifying
patients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary
angiography. We present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of
atherosclerosis with an in-built imputation algorithm and particle swarm
optimization (PSO). We compare the performance of our methodology with other
machine learning techniques on STULONG dataset which is based on longitudinal
study of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years. Our methodology
powered by PSO search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk
factor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known
factors. The decision rules extracted by our methodology are able to predict
the risk factors with an accuracy of $99.73%$ which is higher than the
accuracies obtained by application of the state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques presently being employed in the identification of atherosclerosis
risk studies."
"Applications involving dictionary learning, non-negative matrix
factorization, subspace clustering, and parallel factor tensor decomposition
tasks motivate well algorithms for per-block-convex and non-smooth optimization
problems. By leveraging the stochastic approximation paradigm and first-order
acceleration schemes, this paper develops an online and modular learning
algorithm for a large class of non-convex data models, where convexity is
manifested only per-block of variables whenever the rest of them are held
fixed. The advocated algorithm incurs computational complexity that scales
linearly with the number of unknowns. Under minimal assumptions on the cost
functions of the composite optimization task, without bounding constraints on
the optimization variables, or any explicit information on bounds of Lipschitz
coefficients, the expected cost evaluated online at the resultant iterates is
provably convergent with quadratic rate to an accumulation point of the
(per-block) minima, while subgradients of the expected cost asymptotically
vanish in the mean-squared sense. The merits of the general approach are
demonstrated in two online learning setups: (i) Robust linear regression using
a sparsity-cognizant total least-squares criterion; and (ii) semi-supervised
dictionary learning for network-wide link load tracking and imputation with
missing entries. Numerical tests on synthetic and real data highlight the
potential of the proposed framework for streaming data analytics by
demonstrating superior performance over block coordinate descent, and reduced
complexity relative to the popular alternating-direction method of multipliers."
"This study presents a divide-and-conquer (DC) approach based on feature space
decomposition for classification. When large-scale datasets are present,
typical approaches usually employed truncated kernel methods on the feature
space or DC approaches on the sample space. However, this did not guarantee
separability between classes, owing to overfitting. To overcome such problems,
this work proposes a novel DC approach on feature spaces consisting of three
steps. Firstly, we divide the feature space into several subspaces using the
decomposition method proposed in this paper. Subsequently, these feature
subspaces are sent into individual local classifiers for training. Finally, the
outcomes of local classifiers are fused together to generate the final
classification results. Experiments on large-scale datasets are carried out for
performance evaluation. The results show that the error rates of the proposed
DC method decreased comparing with the state-of-the-art fast SVM solvers, e.g.,
reducing error rates by 10.53% and 7.53% on RCV1 and covtype datasets
respectively."
"Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) are high-dimensional vector
representations of objects (eg., words, image parts), relations (eg., sentence
structures), and sequences for use with machine learning algorithms. They
consist of a vector addition operator for representing a collection of
unordered objects, a Binding operator for associating groups of objects, and a
methodology for encoding complex structures.
  We first develop Constraints that machine learning imposes upon VSAs: for
example, similar structures must be represented by similar vectors. The
constraints suggest that current VSAs should represent phrases (""The smart
Brazilian girl"") by binding sums of terms, in addition to simply binding the
terms directly.
  We show that matrix multiplication can be used as the binding operator for a
VSA, and that matrix elements can be chosen at random. A consequence for living
systems is that binding is mathematically possible without the need to specify,
in advance, precise neuron-to-neuron connection properties for large numbers of
synapses.
  A VSA that incorporates these ideas, MBAT (Matrix Binding of Additive Terms),
is described that satisfies all Constraints.
  With respect to machine learning, for some types of problems appropriate VSA
representations permit us to prove learnability, rather than relying on
simulations. We also propose dividing machine (and neural) learning and
representation into three Stages, with differing roles for learning in each
stage.
  For neural modeling, we give ""representational reasons"" for nervous systems
to have many recurrent connections, as well as for the importance of phrases in
language processing.
  Sizing simulations and analyses suggest that VSAs in general, and MBAT in
particular, are ready for real-world applications."
"We propose a batchwise monotone algorithm for dictionary learning. Unlike the
state-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms which impose sparsity
constraints on a sample-by-sample basis, we instead treat the samples as a
batch, and impose the sparsity constraint on the whole. The benefit of
batchwise optimization is that the non-zeros can be better allocated across the
samples, leading to a better approximation of the whole. To accomplish this, we
propose procedures to switch non-zeros in both rows and columns in the support
of the coefficient matrix to reduce the reconstruction error. We prove in the
proposed support switching procedure the objective of the algorithm, i.e., the
reconstruction error, decreases monotonically and converges. Furthermore, we
introduce a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that also operates on
sample batches to provide a warm start. Experiments on both natural image
patches and UCI data sets show that the proposed algorithm produces a better
approximation with the same sparsity levels compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms."
"We often encounter situations in which an experimenter wants to find, by
sequential experimentation, $x_{max} = \arg\max_{x} f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a
(possibly unknown) function of a well controllable variable $x$. Taking
inspiration from physics and engineering, we have designed a new method to
address this problem. In this paper, we first introduce the method in
continuous time, and then present two algorithms for use in sequential
experiments. Through a series of simulation studies, we show that the method is
effective for finding maxima of unknown functions by experimentation, even when
the maximum of the functions drifts or when the signal to noise ratio is low."
"In various applications involving hidden Markov models (HMMs), some of the
hidden states are aliased, having identical output distributions. The
minimality, identifiability and learnability of such aliased HMMs have been
long standing problems, with only partial solutions provided thus far. In this
paper we focus on parametric-output HMMs, whose output distributions come from
a parametric family, and that have exactly two aliased states. For this class,
we present a complete characterization of their minimality and identifiability.
Furthermore, for a large family of parametric output distributions, we derive
computationally efficient and statistically consistent algorithms to detect the
presence of aliasing and learn the aliased HMM transition and emission
parameters. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by several simulations."
"We propose a new algorithm for minimizing regularized empirical loss:
Stochastic Dual Newton Ascent (SDNA). Our method is dual in nature: in each
iteration we update a random subset of the dual variables. However, unlike
existing methods such as stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of
utilizing all curvature information contained in the examples, which leads to
striking improvements in both theory and practice - sometimes by orders of
magnitude. In the special case when an L2-regularizer is used in the primal,
the dual problem is a concave quadratic maximization problem plus a separable
term. In this regime, SDNA in each step solves a proximal subproblem involving
a random principal submatrix of the Hessian of the quadratic function; whence
the name of the method. If, in addition, the loss functions are quadratic, our
method can be interpreted as a novel variant of the recently introduced
Iterative Hessian Sketch."
"The minimization of the logistic loss is a popular approach to batch
supervised learning. Our paper starts from the surprising observation that,
when fitting linear (or kernelized) classifiers, the minimization of the
logistic loss is \textit{equivalent} to the minimization of an exponential
\textit{rado}-loss computed (i) over transformed data that we call Rademacher
observations (rados), and (ii) over the \textit{same} classifier as the one of
the logistic loss. Thus, a classifier learnt from rados can be
\textit{directly} used to classify \textit{observations}. We provide a learning
algorithm over rados with boosting-compliant convergence rates on the
\textit{logistic loss} (computed over examples). Experiments on domains with up
to millions of examples, backed up by theoretical arguments, display that
learning over a small set of random rados can challenge the state of the art
that learns over the \textit{complete} set of examples. We show that rados
comply with various privacy requirements that make them good candidates for
machine learning in a privacy framework. We give several algebraic, geometric
and computational hardness results on reconstructing examples from rados. We
also show how it is possible to craft, and efficiently learn from, rados in a
differential privacy framework. Tests reveal that learning from differentially
private rados can compete with learning from random rados, and hence with batch
learning from examples, achieving non-trivial privacy vs accuracy tradeoffs."
"We present a mathematical construction for the restricted Boltzmann machine
(RBM) that doesn't require specifying the number of hidden units. In fact, the
hidden layer size is adaptive and can grow during training. This is obtained by
first extending the RBM to be sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units.
Then, thanks to a carefully chosen definition of the energy function, we show
that the limit of infinitely many hidden units is well defined. As with RBM,
approximate maximum likelihood training can be performed, resulting in an
algorithm that naturally and adaptively adds trained hidden units during
learning. We empirically study the behaviour of this infinite RBM, showing that
its performance is competitive to that of the RBM, while not requiring the
tuning of a hidden layer size."
"We present a novel adaptive random subspace learning algorithm (RSSL) for
prediction purpose. This new framework is flexible where it can be adapted with
any learning technique. In this paper, we tested the algorithm for regression
and classification problems. In addition, we provide a variety of weighting
schemes to increase the robustness of the developed algorithm. These different
wighting flavors were evaluated on simulated as well as on real-world data sets
considering the cases where the ratio between features (attributes) and
instances (samples) is large and vice versa. The framework of the new algorithm
consists of many stages: first, calculate the weights of all features on the
data set using the correlation coefficient and F-statistic statistical
measurements. Second, randomly draw n samples with replacement from the data
set. Third, perform regular bootstrap sampling (bagging). Fourth, draw without
replacement the indices of the chosen variables. The decision was taken based
on the heuristic subspacing scheme. Fifth, call base learners and build the
model. Sixth, use the model for prediction purpose on test set of the data. The
results show the advancement of the adaptive RSSL algorithm in most of the
cases compared with the synonym (conventional) machine learning algorithms."
"We study online boosting, the task of converting any weak online learner into
a strong online learner. Based on a novel and natural definition of weak online
learnability, we develop two online boosting algorithms. The first algorithm is
an online version of boost-by-majority. By proving a matching lower bound, we
show that this algorithm is essentially optimal in terms of the number of weak
learners and the sample complexity needed to achieve a specified accuracy. This
optimal algorithm is not adaptive however. Using tools from online loss
minimization, we derive an adaptive online boosting algorithm that is also
parameter-free, but not optimal. Both algorithms work with base learners that
can handle example importance weights directly, as well as by rejection
sampling examples with probability defined by the booster. Results are
complemented with an extensive experimental study."
"We provide a summary of the mathematical and computational techniques that
have enabled learning reductions to effectively address a wide class of
problems, and show that this approach to solving machine learning problems can
be broadly useful."
"Modeling the dependence between outputs is a fundamental challenge in
multilabel classification. In this work we show that a generic regularized
nonlinearity mapping independent predictions to joint predictions is sufficient
to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark problems.
Crucially, we compute the joint predictions without ever obtaining any
independent predictions, while incorporating low-rank and smoothness
regularization. We achieve this by leveraging randomized algorithms for matrix
decomposition and kernel approximation. Furthermore, our techniques are
applicable to the multiclass setting. We apply our method to a variety of
multiclass and multilabel data sets, obtaining state-of-the-art results."
"Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable
features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However,
as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the
network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with
increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the
dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this
paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which
generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation
scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are
embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of
different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain
discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method
for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with
statistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel
embedding. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture
yields state-of-the-art image classification error rates on standard domain
adaptation benchmarks."
"Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters
of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower
learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters."
"Metric learning has been shown to be highly effective to improve the
performance of nearest neighbor classification. In this paper, we address the
problem of metric learning for Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices such
as covariance matrices, which arise in many real-world applications. Naively
using standard Mahalanobis metric learning methods under the Euclidean geometry
for SPD matrices is not appropriate, because the difference of SPD matrices can
be a non-SPD matrix and thus the obtained solution can be uninterpretable. To
cope with this problem, we propose to use a properly parameterized LogEuclidean
distance and optimize the metric with respect to kernel-target alignment, which
is a supervised criterion for kernel learning. Then the resulting non-trivial
optimization problem is solved by utilizing the Riemannian geometry. Finally,
we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our LogEuclidean metric
learning algorithm on real-world classification tasks for EEG signals and
texture patches."
"Distributed optimization methods for large-scale machine learning suffer from
a communication bottleneck. It is difficult to reduce this bottleneck while
still efficiently and accurately aggregating partial work from different
machines. In this paper, we present a novel generalization of the recent
communication-efficient primal-dual framework (CoCoA) for distributed
optimization. Our framework, CoCoA+, allows for additive combination of local
updates to the global parameters at each iteration, whereas previous schemes
with convergence guarantees only allow conservative averaging. We give stronger
(primal-dual) convergence rate guarantees for both CoCoA as well as our new
variants, and generalize the theory for both methods to cover non-smooth convex
loss functions. We provide an extensive experimental comparison that shows the
markedly improved performance of CoCoA+ on several real-world distributed
datasets, especially when scaling up the number of machines."
"Stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which visits
only one sample or a mini-batch of samples each time, has recently been proved
to achieve better performance than batch ADMM. However, most stochastic methods
can only achieve a convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt T)$ on general convex
problems,where T is the number of iterations. Hence, these methods are not
scalable with respect to convergence rate (computation cost). There exists only
one stochastic method, called SA-ADMM, which can achieve convergence rate
$O(1/T)$ on general convex problems. However, an extra memory is needed for
SA-ADMM to store the historic gradients on all samples, and thus it is not
scalable with respect to storage cost. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, called scalable stochastic ADMM(SCAS-ADMM), for large-scale
optimization and learning problems. Without the need to store the historic
gradients, SCAS-ADMM can achieve the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ as the best
stochastic method SA-ADMM and batch ADMM on general convex problems.
Experiments on graph-guided fused lasso show that SCAS-ADMM can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in real applications"
"Bankruptcy is a legal procedure that claims a person or organization as a
debtor. It is essential to ascertain the risk of bankruptcy at initial stages
to prevent financial losses. In this perspective, different soft computing
techniques can be employed to ascertain bankruptcy. This study proposes a
bankruptcy prediction system to categorize the companies based on extent of
risk. The prediction system acts as a decision support tool for detection of
bankruptcy

"We give a new deterministic algorithm that non-adaptively learns a hidden
hypergraph from edge-detecting queries. All previous non-adaptive algorithms
either run in exponential time or have non-optimal query complexity. We give
the first polynomial time non-adaptive learning algorithm for learning
hypergraph that asks almost optimal number of queries."
"Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible
with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible
versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised
learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised,
unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic
learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates
(Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that
makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be
interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the
neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective
function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main
idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e.,
with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics.
Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating
the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated
using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and
backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder.
Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of
auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative
interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on
generative learning tasks."
"We present a deep learning approach to estimation of the bead parameters in
welding tasks. Our model is based on a four-hidden-layer neural network
architecture. More specifically, the first three hidden layers of this
architecture utilize Sigmoid function to produce their respective intermediate
outputs. On the other hand, the last hidden layer uses a linear transformation
to generate the final output of this architecture. This transforms our deep
network architecture from a classifier to a non-linear regression model. We
compare the performance of our deep network with a selected number of results
in the literature to show a considerable improvement in reducing the errors in
estimation of these values. Furthermore, we show its scalability on estimating
the weld bead parameters with same level of accuracy on combination of datasets
that pertain to different welding techniques. This is a nontrivial result that
is counter-intuitive to the general belief in this field of research."
"The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the problem of
maintaining an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of
the best submission of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem
particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants
are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they
may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few
theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable
leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood
heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of
re-submission.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of ""leaderboard accuracy"" tailored to the
format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called ""the Ladder""
and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees
in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial
attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from an actual
competition hosted by Kaggle.
  Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for
adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a
seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a
completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a
real competition with no tuning required whatsoever."
"Errors in data are usually unwelcome and so some means to correct them is
useful. However, it is difficult to define, detect or correct errors in an
unsupervised way. Here, we train a deep neural network to re-synthesize its
inputs at its output layer for a given class of data. We then exploit the fact
that this abstract transformation, which we call a deep transform (DT),
inherently rejects information (errors) existing outside of the abstract
feature space. Using the DT to perform probabilistic re-synthesis, we
demonstrate the recovery of data that has been subject to extreme degradation."
"The majority of machine learning algorithms assumes that objects are
represented as vectors. But often the objects we want to learn on are more
naturally represented by other data structures such as sequences and time
series. For these representations many standard learning algorithms are
unavailable. We generalize gradient-based learning algorithms to time series
under dynamic time warping. To this end, we introduce elastic functions, which
extend functions on time series to matrix spaces. Necessary conditions are
presented under which generalized gradient learning on time series is
consistent. We indicate how results carry over to arbitrary elastic distance
functions and to sequences consisting of symbolic elements. Specifically, four
linear classifiers are extended to time series under dynamic time warping and
applied to benchmark datasets. Results indicate that generalized gradient
learning via elastic functions have the potential to complement the
state-of-the-art in statistical pattern recognition on time series."
"Motivated by the problem of computing investment portfolio weightings we
investigate various methods of clustering as alternatives to traditional
mean-variance approaches. Such methods can have significant benefits from a
practical point of view since they remove the need to invert a sample
covariance matrix, which can suffer from estimation error and will almost
certainly be non-stationary. The general idea is to find groups of assets which
share similar return characteristics over time and treat each group as a single
composite asset. We then apply inverse volatility weightings to these new
composite assets. In the course of our investigation we devise a method of
clustering based on triangular potentials and we present associated theoretical
results as well as various examples based on synthetic data."
"Supervised classification approaches can predict labels for unknown data
because of the supervised training process. The success of classification is
heavily dependent on the labeled training data. Differently, clustering is
effective in revealing the aggregation property of unlabeled data, but the
performance of most clustering methods is limited by the absence of labeled
data. In real applications, however, it is time-consuming and sometimes
impossible to obtain labeled data. The combination of clustering and
classification is a promising and active approach which can largely improve the
performance. In this paper, we propose an innovative and effective clustering
framework based on self-adaptive labeling (CSAL) which integrates clustering
and classification on unlabeled data. Clustering is first employed to partition
data and a certain proportion of clustered data are selected by our proposed
labeling approach for training classifiers. In order to refine the trained
classifiers, an iterative process of Expectation-Maximization algorithm is
devised into the proposed clustering framework CSAL. Experiments are conducted
on publicly data sets to test different combinations of clustering algorithms
and classification models as well as various training data labeling methods.
The experimental results show that our approach along with the self-adaptive
method outperforms other methods."
"In this paper we study the problem of learning from multiple modal data for
purpose of document classification. In this problem, each document is composed
two different modals of data, i.e., an image and a text. Cross-modal factor
analysis (CFA) has been proposed to project the two different modals of data to
a shared data space, so that the classification of a image or a text can be
performed directly in this space. A disadvantage of CFA is that it has ignored
the supervision information. In this paper, we improve CFA by incorporating the
supervision information to represent and classify both image and text modals of
documents. We project both image and text data to a shared data space by factor
analysis, and then train a class label predictor in the shared space to use the
class label information. The factor analysis parameter and the predictor
parameter are learned jointly by solving one single objective function. With
this objective function, we minimize the distance between the projections of
image and text of the same document, and the classification error of the
projection measured by hinge loss function. The objective function is optimized
by an alternate optimization strategy in an iterative algorithm. Experiments in
two different multiple modal document data sets show the advantage of the
proposed algorithm over other CFA methods."
"We describe an iterative procedure for optimizing policies, with guaranteed
monotonic improvement. By making several approximations to the
theoretically-justified procedure, we develop a practical algorithm, called
Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is similar to natural
policy gradient methods and is effective for optimizing large nonlinear
policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust
performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming,
hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen
as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends
to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters."
"We study the classic online learning problem of predicting with expert
advice, and propose a truly parameter-free and adaptive algorithm that achieves
several objectives simultaneously without using any prior information. The main
component of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm
(Luo and Schapire, 2014), called AdaNormalHedge. On one hand, this new
algorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost
constant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the
algorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts
simultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and
the competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al.
(2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the
sleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of
AdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2)
predicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these
applications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a
special case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by
Warmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal
shifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses."
"Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent is a popular method for solving regularized
loss minimization for the case of convex losses. In this paper we show how a
variant of SDCA can be applied for non-convex losses. We prove linear
convergence rate even if individual loss functions are non-convex as long as
the expected loss is convex."
"In this work we study the quantitative relation between VC-dimension and two
other basic parameters related to learning and teaching. Namely, the quality of
sample compression schemes and of teaching sets for classes of low
VC-dimension. Let $C$ be a binary concept class of size $m$ and VC-dimension
$d$. Prior to this work, the best known upper bounds for both parameters were
$\log(m)$, while the best lower bounds are linear in $d$. We present
significantly better upper bounds on both as follows. Set $k = O(d 2^d \log
\log |C|)$.
  We show that there always exists a concept $c$ in $C$ with a teaching set
(i.e. a list of $c$-labeled examples uniquely identifying $c$ in $C$) of size
$k$. This problem was studied by Kuhlmann (1999). Our construction implies that
the recursive teaching (RT) dimension of $C$ is at most $k$ as well. The
RT-dimension was suggested by Zilles et al. and Doliwa et al. (2010). The same
notion (under the name partial-ID width) was independently studied by Wigderson
and Yehudayoff (2013). An upper bound on this parameter that depends only on
$d$ is known just for the very simple case $d=1$, and is open even for $d=2$.
We also make small progress towards this seemingly modest goal.
  We further construct sample compression schemes of size $k$ for $C$, with
additional information of $k \log(k)$ bits. Roughly speaking, given any list of
$C$-labelled examples of arbitrary length, we can retain only $k$ labeled
examples in a way that allows to recover the labels of all others examples in
the list, using additional $k\log (k)$ information bits. This problem was first
suggested by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986)."
"We consider the problem of learning to choose actions using contextual
information when provided with limited feedback in the form of relative
pairwise comparisons. We study this problem in the dueling-bandits framework of
Yue et al. (2009), which we extend to incorporate context. Roughly, the
learner's goal is to find the best policy, or way of behaving, in some space of
policies, although ""best"" is not always so clearly defined. Here, we propose a
new and natural solution concept, rooted in game theory, called a von Neumann
winner, a randomized policy that beats or ties every other policy. We show that
this notion overcomes important limitations of existing solutions, particularly
the Condorcet winner which has typically been used in the past, but which
requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We then present three
efficient algorithms for online learning in our setting, and for approximating
a von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these algorithms
achieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although its
time and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space. The
other two algorithms require time and space only logarithmic in the size of the
policy space when provided access to an oracle for solving classification
problems on the space."
"A classic tension exists between exact inference in a simple model and
approximate inference in a complex model. The latter offers expressivity and
thus accuracy, but the former provides coverage of the space, an important
property for confidence estimation and learning with indirect supervision. In
this work, we introduce a new approach, reified context models, to reconcile
this tension. Specifically, we let the amount of context (the arity of the
factors in a graphical model) be chosen ""at run-time"" by reifying it---that is,
letting this choice itself be a random variable inside the model. Empirically,
we show that our approach obtains expressivity and coverage on three natural
language tasks."
"Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are often used for approximate
inference inside learning, but their slow mixing can be difficult to diagnose
and the approximations can seriously degrade learning. To alleviate these
issues, we define a new model family using strong Doeblin Markov chains, whose
mixing times can be precisely controlled by a parameter. We also develop an
algorithm to learn such models, which involves maximizing the data likelihood
under the induced stationary distribution of these chains. We show empirical
improvements on two challenging inference tasks."
"Strongly adaptive algorithms are algorithms whose performance on every time
interval is close to optimal. We present a reduction that can transform
standard low-regret algorithms to strongly adaptive. As a consequence, we
derive simple, yet efficient, strongly adaptive algorithms for a handful of
problems."
"Given a set $X$ and a function $h:X\longrightarrow\{0,1\}$ which labels each
element of $X$ with either $0$ or $1$, we may define a function $h^{(s)}$ to
measure the similarity of pairs of points in $X$ according to $h$.
Specifically, for $h\in \{0,1\}^X$ we define $h^{(s)}\in \{0,1\}^{X\times X}$
by $h^{(s)}(w,x):= \mathbb{1}[h(w) = h(x)]$. This idea can be extended to a set
of functions, or hypothesis space $\mathcal{H} \subseteq \{0,1\}^X$ by defining
a similarity hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}^{(s)}:=\{h^{(s)}:h\in\mathcal{H}\}$.
We show that ${{vc-dimension}}(\mathcal{H}^{(s)}) \in
\Theta({{vc-dimension}}(\mathcal{H}))$."
"We study a general class of online learning problems where the feedback is
specified by a graph. This class includes online prediction with expert advice
and the multi-armed bandit problem, but also several learning problems where
the online player does not necessarily observe his own loss. We analyze how the
structure of the feedback graph controls the inherent difficulty of the induced
$T$-round learning problem. Specifically, we show that any feedback graph
belongs to one of three classes: strongly observable graphs, weakly observable
graphs, and unobservable graphs. We prove that the first class induces learning
problems with $\widetilde\Theta(\alpha^{1/2} T^{1/2})$ minimax regret, where
$\alpha$ is the independence number of the underlying graph; the second class
induces problems with $\widetilde\Theta(\delta^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ minimax regret,
where $\delta$ is the domination number of a certain portion of the graph; and
the third class induces problems with linear minimax regret. Our results
subsume much of the previous work on learning with feedback graphs and reveal
new connections to partial monitoring games. We also show how the regret is
affected if the graphs are allowed to vary with time."
"Efficiently learning mixture of Gaussians is a fundamental problem in
statistics and learning theory. Given samples coming from a random one out of k
Gaussian distributions in Rn, the learning problem asks to estimate the means
and the covariance matrices of these Gaussians. This learning problem arises in
many areas ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences, and has
also found many machine learning applications. Unfortunately, learning mixture
of Gaussians is an information theoretically hard problem: in order to learn
the parameters up to a reasonable accuracy, the number of samples required is
exponential in the number of Gaussian components in the worst case. In this
work, we show that provided we are in high enough dimensions, the class of
Gaussian mixtures is learnable in its most general form under a smoothed
analysis framework, where the parameters are randomly perturbed from an
adversarial starting point. In particular, given samples from a mixture of
Gaussians with randomly perturbed parameters, when n > {\Omega}(k^2), we give
an algorithm that learns the parameters with polynomial running time and using
polynomial number of samples. The central algorithmic ideas consist of new ways
to decompose the moment tensor of the Gaussian mixture by exploiting its
structural properties. The symmetries of this tensor are derived from the
combinatorial structure of higher order moments of Gaussian distributions
(sometimes referred to as Isserlis' theorem or Wick's theorem). We also develop
new tools for bounding smallest singular values of structured random matrices,
which could be useful in other smoothed analysis settings."
"\emph{Semi-Automated Text Classification} (SATC) may be defined as the task
of ranking a set $\mathcal{D}$ of automatically labelled textual documents in
such a way that, if a human annotator validates (i.e., inspects and corrects
where appropriate) the documents in a top-ranked portion of $\mathcal{D}$ with
the goal of increasing the overall labelling accuracy of $\mathcal{D}$, the
expected increase is maximized. An obvious SATC strategy is to rank
$\mathcal{D}$ so that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the
lowest confidence are top-ranked. In this work we show that this strategy is
suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the
notion of \emph{validation gain}, defined as the improvement in classification
effectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled
document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking
methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about
by partially validating a list generated by a given ranking method. We report
the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method
above, and according to the proposed measure, our utility-theoretic ranking
methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification
error."

"This paper focuses on the problem of simultaneous sample and feature
selection for machine learning in a fully unsupervised setting. Though most
existing works tackle these two problems separately that derives two
well-studied sub-areas namely active learning and feature selection, a unified
approach is inspirational since they are often interleaved with each other.
Noisy and high-dimensional features will bring adverse effect on sample
selection, while `good' samples will be beneficial to feature selection. We
present a framework to jointly conduct active learning and feature selection
based on the CUR matrix decomposition. From the data reconstruction
perspective, both the selected samples and features can best approximate the
original dataset respectively, such that the selected samples characterized by
the selected features are very representative. Additionally our method is
one-shot without iteratively selecting samples for progressive labeling. Thus
our model is especially suitable when the initial labeled samples are scarce or
totally absent, which existing works hardly address particularly for
simultaneous feature selection. To alleviate the NP-hardness of the raw
problem, the proposed formulation involves a convex but non-smooth optimization
problem. We solve it efficiently by an iterative algorithm, and prove its
global convergence. Experiments on publicly available datasets validate that
our method is promising compared with the state-of-the-arts."
"We consider classification problems in which the label space has structure. A
common example is hierarchical label spaces, corresponding to the case where
one label subsumes another (e.g., animal subsumes dog). But labels can also be
mutually exclusive (e.g., dog vs cat) or unrelated (e.g., furry, carnivore). To
jointly model hierarchy and exclusion relations, the notion of a HEX (hierarchy
and exclusion) graph was introduced in [7]. This combined a conditional random
field (CRF) with a deep neural network (DNN), resulting in state of the art
results when applied to visual object classification problems where the
training labels were drawn from different levels of the ImageNet hierarchy
(e.g., an image might be labeled with the basic level category ""dog"", rather
than the more specific label ""husky""). In this paper, we extend the HEX model
to allow for soft or probabilistic relations between labels, which is useful
when there is uncertainty about the relationship between two labels (e.g., an
antelope is ""sort of"" furry, but not to the same degree as a grizzly bear). We
call our new model pHEX, for probabilistic HEX. We show that the pHEX graph can
be converted to an Ising model, which allows us to use existing off-the-shelf
inference methods (in contrast to the HEX method, which needed specialized
inference algorithms). Experimental results show significant improvements in a
number of large-scale visual object classification tasks, outperforming the
previous HEX model."
"The detection of very similar patterns in a time series, commonly called
motifs, has received continuous and increasing attention from diverse
scientific communities. In particular, recent approaches for discovering
similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show
that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared,
and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find
that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies
on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected
by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally
non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure.
Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure
their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the
dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that
depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability
of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series,
and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a
more broad context."
"Polynomial kernel regression is one of the standard and state-of-the-art
learning strategies. However, as is well known, the choices of the degree of
polynomial kernel and the regularization parameter are still open in the realm
of model selection. The first aim of this paper is to develop a strategy to
select these parameters. On one hand, based on the worst-case learning rate
analysis, we show that the regularization term in polynomial kernel regression
is not necessary. In other words, the regularization parameter can decrease
arbitrarily fast when the degree of the polynomial kernel is suitable tuned. On
the other hand,taking account of the implementation of the algorithm, the
regularization term is required. Summarily, the effect of the regularization
term in polynomial kernel regression is only to circumvent the "" ill-condition""
of the kernel matrix. Based on this, the second purpose of this paper is to
propose a new model selection strategy, and then design an efficient learning
algorithm. Both theoretical and experimental analysis show that the new
strategy outperforms the previous one. Theoretically, we prove that the new
learning strategy is almost optimal if the regression function is smooth.
Experimentally, it is shown that the new strategy can significantly reduce the
computational burden without loss of generalization capability."
"We resolve an open question from (Christiano, 2014b) posed in COLT'14
regarding the optimal dependency of the regret achievable for online local
learning on the size of the label set. In this framework the algorithm is shown
a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then
predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a
real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting
scenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut
among others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning
algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$
is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of
$O(\sqrt{n \log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework
concerns closing the above gap.
  In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main
results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming
based algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a), in fact achieves a regret of
$O(\sqrt{nLT})$. Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely,
we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower
regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem
which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a
related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike
planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known
quasi-polynomial time algorithms.
  Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we
hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other
online learning scenarios as well."
"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the
information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be
quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and
output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal
information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization
bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is
quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity.
We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and
features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of
the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input
layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the
layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along
the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new
optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms."
"The apsis toolkit presented in this paper provides a flexible framework for

"Time-series classification is an important problem for the data mining
community due to the wide range of application domains involving time-series
data. A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly
predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the
prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates
typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of
shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that
avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean
distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition,
our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out
only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence
on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4
orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery
method, while providing better prediction accuracy."
"Utilizing the sample size of a dataset, the random cluster model is employed
in order to derive an estimate of the mean number of K-Means clusters to form

"This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks
into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as
visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph
embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which
usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network
embedding method called the ""LINE,"" which is suitable for arbitrary types of
information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method
optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local
and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that
addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and
improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical
experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world
information networks, including language networks, social networks, and
citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the
embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few
hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available
online."
"In this paper we introduce the idea of improving the performance of
parametric temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithms by selectively
emphasizing or de-emphasizing their updates on different time steps. In
particular, we show that varying the emphasis of linear TD($\lambda$)'s updates
in a particular way causes its expected update to become stable under
off-policy training. The only prior model-free TD methods to achieve this with
per-step computation linear in the number of function approximation parameters
are the gradient-TD family of methods including TDC, GTD($\lambda$), and
GQ($\lambda$). Compared to these methods, our _emphatic TD($\lambda$)_ is
simpler and easier to use; it has only one learned parameter vector and one
step-size parameter. Our treatment includes general state-dependent discounting
and bootstrapping functions, and a way of specifying varying degrees of
interest in accurately valuing different states."
"Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble supervised machine learning technique that
was developed by Breiman over a decade ago. Compared with other ensemble
techniques, it has proved its accuracy and superiority. Many researchers,
however, believe that there is still room for enhancing and improving its
performance accuracy. This explains why, over the past decade, there have been
many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and
strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven
empiricallthat ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a
significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper
is twofold. First, it investigates how data clustering (a well known diversity
technique) can be applied to identify groups of similar decision trees in an RF
in order to eliminate redundant trees by selecting a representative from each
group (cluster). Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to
produce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than
RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher
performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called
ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 15 real datasets from the UCI
repository prove the superiority of our proposed extension over the traditional
RF. Most of our experiments achieved at least 95% or above pruning level while
retaining or outperforming the RF accuracy."
"Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences and their similarity to
a time series can be used for time series classification. Since the discovery
of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long
or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast
Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast
Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-the-art
shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by
being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a
ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time
series classification becomes feasible.
  A method for using shapelets for multivariate time series is proposed and
Ultra-Fast Shapelets is proven to be successful in comparison to
state-of-the-art multivariate time series classifiers on 15 multivariate time
series datasets from various domains. Finally, time series derivatives that
have proven to be useful for other time series classifiers are investigated for
the shapelet-based classifiers. It is shown that they have a positive impact
and that they are easy to integrate with a simple preprocessing step, without
the need of adapting the shapelet discovery algorithm."

namely, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) can be used to identify diverse trees in the
RF. Second, trees with the highest LOF scores are then used to produce an
extension of RF termed LOFB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet
performs at least as good as RF, but mostly exhibits higher performance in
terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble
pruning. Experimental results on 10 real datasets prove the superiority of our
proposed extension over the traditional RF. Unprecedented pruning levels
reaching 99% have been achieved at the time of boosting the predictive accuracy
of the ensemble. The notably high pruning level makes the technique a good
candidate for real-time applications."
"We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an
alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks
(GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. Because the
transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a
small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small
moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised
function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by
back-propagation. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the
probabilistic interpretation of denoising auto-encoders and provide an
interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized
pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and
sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). We study
how GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of
variables given the rest. Successful experiments are conducted, validating
these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular
architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows
training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining."
"We discuss data representation which can be learned automatically from data,
are invariant to transformations, and at the same time selective, in the sense
that two points have the same representation only if they are one the
transformation of the other. The mathematical results here sharpen some of the
key claims of i-theory -- a recent theory of feedforward processing in sensory
cortex."
"In this paper, we investigate a largely extended version of classical MAB
problem, called networked combinatorial bandit problems. In particular, we
consider the setting of a decision maker over a networked bandits as follows:
each time a combinatorial strategy, e.g., a group of arms, is chosen, and the
decision maker receives a reward resulting from her strategy and also receives
a side bonus resulting from that strategy for each arm's neighbor. This is
motivated by many real applications such as on-line social networks where
friends can provide their feedback on shared content, therefore if we promote a
product to a user, we can also collect feedback from her friends on that
product. To this end, we consider two types of side bonus in this study: side
observation and side reward. Upon the number of arms pulled at each time slot,
we study two cases: single-play and combinatorial-play. Consequently, this
leaves us four scenarios to investigate in the presence of side bonus:
Single-play with Side Observation, Combinatorial-play with Side Observation,
Single-play with Side Reward, and Combinatorial-play with Side Reward. For each
case, we present and analyze a series of \emph{zero regret} polices where the
expect of regret over time approaches zero as time goes to infinity. Extensive
simulations validate the effectiveness of our results."
"We analyse optimum reject strategies for prototype-based classifiers and
real-valued rejection measures, using the distance of a data point to the
closest prototype or probabilistic counterparts. We compare reject schemes with
global thresholds, and local thresholds for the Voronoi cells of the
classifier. For the latter, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to compute
optimum thresholds based on a dynamic programming scheme, and we propose an
intuitive linear time, memory efficient approximation thereof with competitive
accuracy. Evaluating the performance in various benchmarks, we conclude that
local reject options are beneficial in particular for simple prototype-based
classifiers, while the improvement is less pronounced for advanced models. For
the latter, an accuracy-reject curve which is comparable to support vector
machine classifiers with state of the art reject options can be reached."
"Predicting the Credit Defaulter is a perilous task of Financial Industries
like Banks. Ascertaining non-payer before giving loan is a significant and
conflict-ridden task of the Banker. Classification techniques are the better
choice for predictive analysis like finding the claimant, whether he/she is an
unpretentious customer or a cheat. Defining the outstanding classifier is a
risky assignment for any industrialist like a banker. This allow computer
science researchers to drill down efficient research works through evaluating
different classifiers and finding out the best classifier for such predictive
problems. This research work investigates the productivity of LADTree
Classifier and REPTree Classifier for the credit risk prediction and compares
their fitness through various measures. German credit dataset has been taken
and used to predict the credit risk with a help of open source machine learning
tool."
"With the rapid increase in volume of time series medical data available
through wearable devices, there is a need to employ automated algorithms to
label data. Examples of labels include interventions, changes in activity (e.g.
sleep) and changes in physiology (e.g. arrhythmias). However, automated
algorithms tend to be unreliable resulting in lower quality care. Expert
annotations are scarce, expensive, and prone to significant inter- and
intra-observer variance. To address these problems, a Bayesian
Continuous-valued Label Aggregator(BCLA) is proposed to provide a reliable
estimation of label aggregation while accurately infer the precision and bias
of each algorithm. The BCLA was applied to QT interval (pro-arrhythmic
indicator) estimation from the electrocardiogram using labels from the 2006
PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database. It was compared to the
mean, median, and a previously proposed Expectation Maximization (EM) label
aggregation approaches. While accurately predicting each labelling algorithm's
bias and precision, the root-mean-square error of the BCLA was
11.78$\pm$0.63ms, significantly outperforming the best Challenge entry
(15.37$\pm$2.13ms) as well as the EM, mean, and median voting strategies
(14.76$\pm$0.52ms, 17.61$\pm$0.55ms, and 14.43$\pm$0.57ms respectively with
$p<0.0001$)."
"We give a probabilistic interpretation of sampling theory of graph signals.
To do this, we first define a generative model for the data using a pairwise
Gaussian random field (GRF) which depends on the graph. We show that, under
certain conditions, reconstructing a graph signal from a subset of its samples
by least squares is equivalent to performing MAP inference on an approximation
of this GRF which has a low rank covariance matrix. We then show that a
sampling set of given size with the largest associated cut-off frequency, which
is optimal from a sampling theoretic point of view, minimizes the worst case
predictive covariance of the MAP estimate on the GRF. This interpretation also
gives an intuitive explanation for the superior performance of the sampling
theoretic approach to active semi-supervised classification."
"In this paper, we propose the problem of online cost-sensitive clas- sifier
adaptation and the first algorithm to solve it. We assume we have a base
classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained with
respect to a cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have
some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The prob- lem
is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the
steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a
new classifier by adding an adaptation function to the base classifier, and
update the adaptation function parameter according to the streaming data
samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we up-
date the adaptation function parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss
and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed
algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on
two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it
not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires
significantly less running time."
"Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is a key machine learning
algorithm for extracting nonlinear features from data. In the presence of a
large volume of high dimensional data collected in a distributed fashion, it
becomes very costly to communicate all of this data to a single data center and
then perform kernel PCA. Can we perform kernel PCA on the entire dataset in a
distributed and communication efficient fashion while maintaining provable and
strong guarantees in solution quality?
  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the question by developing a
communication efficient algorithm to perform kernel PCA in the distributed
setting. The algorithm is a clever combination of subspace embedding and
adaptive sampling techniques, and we show that the algorithm can take as input
an arbitrary configuration of distributed datasets, and compute a set of global
kernel principal components with relative error guarantees independent of the
dimension of the feature space or the total number of data points. In
particular, computing $k$ principal components with relative error $\epsilon$
over $s$ workers has communication cost $\tilde{O}(s \rho k/\epsilon+s
k^2/\epsilon^3)$ words, where $\rho$ is the average number of nonzero entries
in each data point. Furthermore, we experimented the algorithm with large-scale
real world datasets and showed that the algorithm produces a high quality
kernel PCA solution while using significantly less communication than
alternative approaches."
"In supervised learning, simple baseline classifiers can be constructed by
only looking at the class, i.e., ignoring any other information from the
dataset. The single-label learning community frequently uses as a reference the
one which always predicts the majority class. Although a classifier might
perform worse than this simple baseline classifier, this behaviour requires a
special explanation. Aiming to motivate the community to compare experimental
results with the ones provided by a multi-label baseline classifier, calling
the attention about the need of special explanations related to classifiers
which perform worse than the baseline, in this work we propose the use of
General_B, a multi-label baseline classifier. General_B was evaluated in
contrast to results published in the literature which were carefully selected
using a systematic review process. It was found that a considerable number of
published results on 10 frequently used datasets are worse than or equal to the
ones obtained by General_B, and for one dataset it reaches up to 43% of the
dataset published results. Moreover, although a simple baseline classifier was
not considered in these publications, it was observed that even for very poor
results no special explanations were provided in most of them. We hope that the
findings of this work would encourage the multi-label community to consider the
idea of using a simple baseline classifier, such that further explanations are
provided when a classifiers performs worse than a baseline."
"Sample compression schemes were defined by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986) as
an abstraction of the structure underlying many learning algorithms. Roughly
speaking, a sample compression scheme of size $k$ means that given an arbitrary
list of labeled examples, one can retain only $k$ of them in a way that allows
to recover the labels of all other examples in the list. They showed that
compression implies PAC learnability for binary-labeled classes, and asked
whether the other direction holds. We answer their question and show that every
concept class $C$ with VC dimension $d$ has a sample compression scheme of size
exponential in $d$. The proof uses an approximate minimax phenomenon for binary
matrices of low VC dimension, which may be of interest in the context of game
theory."
"Big Data concern large-volume, growing data sets that are complex and have
multiple autonomous sources. Earlier technologies were not able to handle
storage and processing of huge data thus Big Data concept comes into existence.
This is a tedious job for users unstructured data. So, there should be some
mechanism which classify unstructured data into organized form which helps user
to easily access required data. Classification techniques over big
transactional database provide required data to the users from large datasets
more simple way. There are two main classification techniques, supervised and
unsupervised. In this paper we focused on to study of different supervised
classification techniques. Further this paper shows a advantages and
limitations."
"Automated learning of patients demographics can be seen as multi-label
problem where a patient model is based on different race and gender groups. The
resulting model can be further integrated into Privacy-Preserving Data Mining,
where it can be used to assess risk of identification of different patient
groups. Our project considers relations between diabetes and demographics of
patients as a multi-labelled problem. Most research in this area has been done
as binary classification, where the target class is finding if a person has
diabetes or not. But very few, and maybe no work has been done in multi-labeled
analysis of the demographics of patients who are likely to be diagnosed with
diabetes. To identify such groups, we applied ensembles of several multi-label
learning algorithms."
"Quasi-Newton methods are widely used in practise for convex loss minimization
problems. These methods exhibit good empirical performance on a wide variety of
tasks and enjoy super-linear convergence to the optimal solution. For
large-scale learning problems, stochastic Quasi-Newton methods have been
recently proposed. However, these typically only achieve sub-linear convergence
rates and have not been shown to consistently perform well in practice since
noisy Hessian approximations can exacerbate the effect of high-variance
stochastic gradient estimates. In this work we propose Vite, a novel stochastic
Quasi-Newton algorithm that uses an existing first-order technique to reduce
this variance. Without exploiting the specific form of the approximate Hessian,
we show that Vite reaches the optimum at a geometric rate with a constant
step-size when dealing with smooth strongly convex functions. Empirically, we
demonstrate improvements over existing stochastic Quasi-Newton and variance
reduced stochastic gradient methods."
"Multi-armed bandits (MAB) model sequential decision making problems, in which
a learner sequentially chooses arms with unknown reward distributions in order
to maximize its cumulative reward. Most of the prior work on MAB assumes that
the reward distributions of each arm are independent. But in a wide variety of
decision problems -- from drug dosage to dynamic pricing -- the expected
rewards of different arms are correlated, so that selecting one arm provides
information about the expected rewards of other arms as well. We propose and
analyze a class of models of such decision problems, which we call global
bandits. In the case in which rewards of all arms are deterministic functions
of a single unknown parameter, we construct a greedy policy that achieves
bounded regret, with a bound that depends on the single true parameter of the
problem. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times
with probability one. For this case we also obtain a bound on regret that is
independent of the true parameter; this bound is sub-linear, with an exponent
that depends on the informativeness of the arms (which measures the strength of
correlation between expected arm rewards). We also prove matching lower bounds
for the worst-case regret of the greedy policy."
"Symmetric positive semi-definite (SPSD) matrix approximation methods have
been extensively used to speed up large-scale eigenvalue computation and kernel
learning methods. The standard sketch based method, which we call the prototype
model, produces relatively accurate approximations, but is inefficient on large
square matrices. The Nystr\""om method is highly efficient, but can only achieve
low accuracy. In this paper we propose a novel model that we call the {\it fast
SPSD matrix approximation model}. The fast model is nearly as efficient as the
Nystr\""om method and as accurate as the prototype model. We show that the fast
model can potentially solve eigenvalue problems and kernel learning problems in
linear time with respect to the matrix size $n$ to achieve $1+\epsilon$
relative-error, whereas both the prototype model and the Nystr\""om method cost
at least quadratic time to attain comparable error bound. Empirical comparisons
among the prototype model, the Nystr\""om method, and our fast model demonstrate
the superiority of the fast model. We also contribute new understandings of the
Nystr\""om method. The Nystr\""om method is a special instance of our fast model
and is approximation to the prototype model. Our technique can be
straightforwardly applied to make the CUR matrix decomposition more efficiently
computed without much affecting the accuracy."
"Many modern multiclass and multilabel problems are characterized by
increasingly large output spaces. For these problems, label embeddings have
been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and
statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank
constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers a
fast label embedding algorithm which works in both the multiclass and
multilabel settings. The result is a randomized algorithm for partial least
squares, whose running time is exponentially faster than naive algorithms. We
demonstrate our techniques on two large-scale public datasets, from the Large
Scale Hierarchical Text Challenge and the Open Directory Project, where we
obtain state of the art results."
"Categorization axioms have been proposed to axiomatizing clustering results,
which offers a hint of bridging the difference between human recognition system
and machine learning through an intuitive observation: an object should be
assigned to its most similar category. However, categorization axioms cannot be
generalized into a general machine learning system as categorization axioms
become trivial when the number of categories becomes one. In order to
generalize categorization axioms into general cases, categorization input and
categorization output are reinterpreted by inner and outer category
representation. According to the categorization reinterpretation, two category
representation axioms are presented. Category representation axioms and
categorization axioms can be combined into a generalized categorization
axiomatic framework, which accurately delimit the theoretical categorization
constraints and overcome the shortcoming of categorization axioms. The proposed
axiomatic framework not only discuses categorization test issue but also
reinterprets many results in machine learning in a unified way, such as
dimensionality reduction,density estimation, regression, clustering and
classification."
"The problem of feature selection has raised considerable interests in the
past decade. Traditional unsupervised methods select the features which can
faithfully preserve the intrinsic structures of data, where the intrinsic
structures are estimated using all the input features of data. However, the
estimated intrinsic structures are unreliable/inaccurate when the redundant and
noisy features are not removed. Therefore, we face a dilemma here: one need the
true structures of data to identify the informative features, and one need the
informative features to accurately estimate the true structures of data. To
address this, we propose a unified learning framework which performs structure
learning and feature selection simultaneously. The structures are adaptively
learned from the results of feature selection, and the informative features are
reselected to preserve the refined structures of data. By leveraging the
interactions between these two essential tasks, we are able to capture accurate
structures and select more informative features. Experimental results on many
benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state
of the art unsupervised feature selection methods."
"Understanding the dynamic mechanisms that drive the high-impact scientific
work (e.g., research papers, patents) is a long-debated research topic and has
many important implications, ranging from personal career development and
recruitment search, to the jurisdiction of research resources. Recent advances
in characterizing and modeling scientific success have made it possible to
forecast the long-term impact of scientific work, where data mining techniques,
supervised learning in particular, play an essential role. Despite much
progress, several key algorithmic challenges in relation to predicting
long-term scientific impact have largely remained open. In this paper, we
propose a joint predictive model to forecast the long-term scientific impact at
the early stage, which simultaneously addresses a number of these open
challenges, including the scholarly feature design, the non-linearity, the
domain-heterogeneity and dynamics. In particular, we formulate it as a
regularized optimization problem and propose effective and scalable algorithms
to solve it. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on large, real
scholarly data sets to validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our
method."
"We propose a method for estimating channel parameters from RSSI measurements
and the lost packet count, which can work in the presence of losses due to both
interference and signal attenuation below the noise floor. This is especially
important in the wireless networks, such as vehicular, where propagation model
changes with the density of nodes. The method is based on Stochastic
Expectation Maximization, where the received data is modeled as a mixture of
distributions (no/low interference and strong interference), incomplete
(censored) due to packet losses. The PDFs in the mixture are Gamma, according
to the commonly accepted model for wireless signal and interference power. This
approach leverages the loss count as additional information, hence
outperforming maximum likelihood estimation, which does not use this
information (ML-), for a small number of received RSSI samples. Hence, it
allows inexpensive on-line channel estimation from ad-hoc collected data. The
method also outperforms ML- on uncensored data mixtures, as ML- assumes that
samples are from a single-mode PDF."
"Stochastic Dual Coordinate Descent (SDCD) has become one of the most
efficient ways to solve the family of $\ell_2$-regularized empirical risk
minimization problems, including linear SVM, logistic regression, and many
others. The vanilla implementation of DCD is quite slow; however, by
maintaining primal variables while updating dual variables, the time complexity
of SDCD can be significantly reduced. Such a strategy forms the core algorithm
in the widely-used LIBLINEAR package. In this paper, we parallelize the SDCD
algorithms in LIBLINEAR. In recent research, several synchronized parallel SDCD
algorithms have been proposed, however, they fail to achieve good speedup in
the shared memory multi-core setting. In this paper, we propose a family of
asynchronous stochastic dual coordinate descent algorithms (ASDCD). Each thread
repeatedly selects a random dual variable and conducts coordinate updates using
the primal variables that are stored in the shared memory. We analyze the
convergence properties when different locking/atomic mechanisms are applied.
For implementation with atomic operations, we show linear convergence under
mild conditions. For implementation without any atomic operations or locking,
we present the first {\it backward error analysis} for ASDCD under the
multi-core environment, showing that the converged solution is the exact
solution for a primal problem with perturbed regularizer. Experimental results
show that our methods are much faster than previous parallel coordinate descent
solvers."
"The paper outlines a framework for autonomous control of a CRM (customer
relationship management) system. First, it explores how a modified version of
the widely accepted Recency-Frequency-Monetary Value system of metrics can be
used to define the state space of clients or donors. Second, it describes a
procedure to determine the optimal direct marketing action in discrete and
continuous action space for the given individual, based on his position in the
state space. The procedure involves the use of model-free Q-learning to train a
deep neural network that relates a client's position in the state space to
rewards associated with possible marketing actions. The estimated value
function over the client state space can be interpreted as customer lifetime
value, and thus allows for a quick plug-in estimation of CLV for a given
client. Experimental results are presented, based on KDD Cup 1998 mailing
dataset of donation solicitations."
"The recruitment of new personnel is one of the most essential business
processes which affect the quality of human capital within any company. It is
highly essential for the companies to ensure the recruitment of right talent to
maintain a competitive edge over the others in the market. However IT companies
often face a problem while recruiting new people for their ongoing projects due
to lack of a proper framework that defines a criteria for the selection
process. In this paper we aim to develop a framework that would allow any
project manager to take the right decision for selecting new talent by
correlating performance parameters with the other domain-specific attributes of
the candidates. Also, another important motivation behind this project is to
check the validity of the selection procedure often followed by various big
companies in both public and private sectors which focus only on academic
scores, GPA/grades of students from colleges and other academic backgrounds. We
test if such a decision will produce optimal results in the industry or is
there a need for change that offers a more holistic approach to recruitment of
new talent in the software companies. The scope of this work extends beyond the
IT domain and a similar procedure can be adopted to develop a recruitment
framework in other fields as well. Data-mining techniques provide useful
information from the historical projects depending on which the hiring-manager
can make decisions for recruiting high-quality workforce. This study aims to
bridge this hiatus by developing a data-mining framework based on an
ensemble-learning technique to refocus on the criteria for personnel selection.
The results from this research clearly demonstrated that there is a need to
refocus on the selection-criteria for quality objectives."
"Representation learning is currently a very hot topic in modern machine
learning, mostly due to the great success of the deep learning methods. In
particular low-dimensional representation which discriminates classes can not
only enhance the classification procedure, but also make it faster, while
contrary to the high-dimensional embeddings can be efficiently used for visual
based exploratory data analysis.
  In this paper we propose Maximum Entropy Linear Manifold (MELM), a
multidimensional generalization of Multithreshold Entropy Linear Classifier
model which is able to find a low-dimensional linear data projection maximizing
discriminativeness of projected classes. As a result we obtain a linear
embedding which can be used for classification, class aware dimensionality
reduction and data visualization. MELM provides highly discriminative 2D
projections of the data which can be used as a method for constructing robust
classifiers.
  We provide both empirical evaluation as well as some interesting theoretical
properties of our objective function such us scale and affine transformation
invariance, connections with PCA and bounding of the expected balanced accuracy
error."
"Co-occurrence Data is a common and important information source in many
areas, such as the word co-occurrence in the sentences, friends co-occurrence
in social networks and products co-occurrence in commercial transaction data,
etc, which contains rich correlation and clustering information about the
items. In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-based
probabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-based
model, namely, the $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_k$ models, which are able to capture
different levels of dependency in the co-occurrence data. We also discuss how
several typical existing models are related to these three types of energy
models, including the Fully Visible Boltzmann Machine (FVBM) ($L_2$), Matrix
Factorization ($L_2$), Log-BiLinear (LBL) models ($L_2$), and the Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model ($L_k$). Then, we propose a Deep Embedding Model
(DEM) (an $L_k$ model) from the energy model in a \emph{principled} manner.
Furthermore, motivated by the observation that the partition function in the
energy model is intractable and the fact that the major objective of modeling
the co-occurrence data is to predict using the conditional probability, we
apply the \emph{maximum pseudo-likelihood} method to learn DEM. In consequence,
the developed model and its learning method naturally avoid the above
difficulties and can be easily used to compute the conditional probability in
prediction. Interestingly, our method is equivalent to learning a special
structured deep neural network using back-propagation and a special sampling
strategy, which makes it scalable on large-scale datasets. Finally, in the
experiments, we show that the DEM can achieve comparable or better results than
state-of-the-art methods on datasets across several application domains."
"In this age of Big Data, machine learning based data mining methods are
extensively used to inspect large scale data sets. Deriving applicable
predictive modeling from these type of data sets is a challenging obstacle
because of their high complexity. Opportunity with high data availability
levels, automated classification of data sets has become a critical and
complicated function. In this paper, the power of applying MapReduce based
Distributed AdaBoosting of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are explored to build
reliable predictive bag of classification models. Thus, (i) dataset ensembles
are build; (ii) ELM algorithm is used to build weak classification models; and
(iii) build a strong classification model from a set of weak classification
models. This training model is applied to the publicly available knowledge
discovery and data mining datasets."
"Reducing the amount of human supervision is a key problem in machine learning
and a natural approach is that of exploiting the relations (structure) among
different tasks. This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this
context a fundamental question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the
learning problem.We tackle this question by studying a general computational
framework that allows to encode a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in
the form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed
methods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear
approaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can
be efficiently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be
approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating
minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum."
"In this paper, we consider the distributed stochastic multi-armed bandit
problem, where a global arm set can be accessed by multiple players
independently. The players are allowed to exchange their history of
observations with each other at specific points in time. We study the
relationship between regret and communication. When the time horizon is known,
we propose the Over-Exploration strategy, which only requires one-round
communication and whose regret does not scale with the number of players. When
the time horizon is unknown, we measure the frequency of communication through
a new notion called the density of the communication set, and give an exact
characterization of the interplay between regret and communication.
Specifically, a lower bound is established and stable strategies that match the
lower bound are developed. The results and analyses in this paper are specific
but can be translated into more general settings."
"Nonlinear component analysis such as kernel Principle Component Analysis
(KPCA) and kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) are widely used in
machine learning, statistics and data analysis, but they can not scale up to
big datasets. Recent attempts have employed random feature approximations to
convert the problem to the primal form for linear computational complexity.
However, to obtain high quality solutions, the number of random features should
be the same order of magnitude as the number of data points, making such
approach not directly applicable to the regime with millions of data points.
  We propose a simple, computationally efficient, and memory friendly algorithm
based on the ""doubly stochastic gradients"" to scale up a range of kernel
nonlinear component analysis, such as kernel PCA, CCA and SVD. Despite the
\emph{non-convex} nature of these problems, our method enjoys theoretical
guarantees that it converges at the rate $\tilde{O}(1/t)$ to the global
optimum, even for the top $k$ eigen subspace. Unlike many alternatives, our
algorithm does not require explicit orthogonalization, which is infeasible on
big datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm
on large scale synthetic and real world datasets."
"In this paper, we propose a maximum margin classifier that deals with
uncertainty in data input. Specifically, we reformulate the SVM framework such
that each input training entity is not solely a feature vector representation,
but a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution with given probability density,
i.e., with a given mean and covariance matrix. The latter expresses the
uncertainty. We arrive at a convex optimization problem, which is solved in the
primal form using a gradient descent approach. The resulting classifier, which
we name SVM with Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (SVM-GSU), is tested on synthetic
data, as well as on the problem of event detection in video using the
large-scale TRECVID MED 2014 dataset, and the problem of image classification
using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Experimental results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed classifier."
"This paper presents the Nataf-Beta Random Field Classifier, a discriminative
approach that extends the applicability of the Beta conjugate prior to
classification problems. The approach's key feature is to model the probability
of a class conditional on attribute values as a random field whose marginals
are Beta distributed, and where the parameters of marginals are themselves
described by random fields. Although the classification accuracy of the
approach proposed does not statistically outperform the best accuracies
reported in the literature, it ranks among the top tier for the six benchmark
datasets tested. The Nataf-Beta Random Field Classifier is suited as a general
purpose classification approach for real-continuous and real-integer attribute
value problems."
"The nature of clinical data makes it difficult to quickly select, tune and
apply machine learning algorithms to clinical prognosis. As a result, a lot of
time is spent searching for the most appropriate machine learning algorithms
applicable in clinical prognosis that contains either binary-valued or
multi-valued attributes. The study set out to identify and evaluate the
performance of machine learning classification schemes applied in clinical
prognosis of post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients.
Multilayer Perceptron, J48, and the Naive Bayes algorithms were used to train
and test models on Thoracic Surgery datasets obtained from the University of
California Irvine machine learning repository. Stratified 10-fold
cross-validation was used to evaluate baseline performance accuracy of the
classifiers. The comparative analysis shows that multilayer perceptron
performed best with classification accuracy of 82.3%, J48 came out second with
classification accuracy of 81.8%, and Naive Bayes came out the worst with
classification accuracy of 74.4%. The quality and outcome of the chosen machine
learning algorithms depends on the ingenuity of the clinical miner."
"We consider the following basic learning task: given independent draws from
an unknown distribution over a discrete support, output an approximation of the
distribution that is as accurate as possible in $\ell_1$ distance (i.e. total
variation or statistical distance). Perhaps surprisingly, it is often possible
to ""de-noise"" the empirical distribution of the samples to return an
approximation of the true distribution that is significantly more accurate than
the empirical distribution, without relying on any prior assumptions on the
distribution. We present an instance optimal learning algorithm which optimally
performs this de-noising for every distribution for which such a de-noising is
possible. More formally, given $n$ independent draws from a distribution $p$,
our algorithm returns a labelled vector whose expected distance from $p$ is
equal to the minimum possible expected error that could be obtained by any
algorithm that knows the true unlabeled vector of probabilities of distribution
$p$ and simply needs to assign labels, up to an additive subconstant term that
is independent of $p$ and goes to zero as $n$ gets large. One conceptual
implication of this result is that for large samples, Bayesian assumptions on
the ""shape"" or bounds on the tail probabilities of a distribution over discrete
support are not helpful for the task of learning the distribution.
  As a consequence of our techniques, we also show that given a set of $n$
samples from an arbitrary distribution, one can accurately estimate the
expected number of distinct elements that will be observed in a sample of any
size up to $n \log n$. This sort of extrapolation is practically relevant,
particularly to domains such as genomics where it is important to understand
how much more might be discovered given larger sample sizes, and we are
optimistic that our approach is practically viable."
"Feature selection and feature transformation, the two main ways to reduce
dimensionality, are often presented separately. In this paper, a feature
selection method is proposed by combining the popular transformation based
dimensionality reduction method Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and sparsity
regularization. We impose row sparsity on the transformation matrix of LDA
through ${\ell}_{2,1}$-norm regularization to achieve feature selection, and
the resultant formulation optimizes for selecting the most discriminative
features and removing the redundant ones simultaneously. The formulation is
extended to the ${\ell}_{2,p}$-norm regularized case: which is more likely to
offer better sparsity when $0<p<1$. Thus the formulation is a better
approximation to the feature selection problem. An efficient algorithm is
developed to solve the ${\ell}_{2,p}$-norm based optimization problem and it is
proved that the algorithm converges when $0<p\le 2$. Systematical experiments
are conducted to understand the work of the proposed method. Promising
experimental results on various types of real-world data sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm."
"We introduce a generalization of temporal-difference (TD) learning to
networks of interrelated predictions. Rather than relating a single prediction
to itself at a later time, as in conventional TD methods, a TD network relates
each prediction in a set of predictions to other predictions in the set at a
later time. TD networks can represent and apply TD learning to a much wider
class of predictions than has previously been possible. Using a random-walk
example, we show that these networks can be used to learn to predict by a fixed
interval, which is not possible with conventional TD methods. Secondly, we show
that if the inter-predictive relationships are made conditional on action, then
the usual learning-efficiency advantage of TD methods over Monte Carlo
(supervised learning) methods becomes particularly pronounced. Thirdly, we
demonstrate that TD networks can learn predictive state representations that
enable exact solution of a non-Markov problem. A very broad range of
inter-predictive temporal relationships can be expressed in these networks.
Overall we argue that TD networks represent a substantial extension of the
abilities of TD methods and bring us closer to the goal of representing world
knowledge in entirely predictive, grounded terms."
"We present a Discriminative Switching Linear Dynamical System (DSLDS) applied
to patient monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Our approach is based on
identifying the state-of-health of a patient given their observed vital signs
using a discriminative classifier, and then inferring their underlying
physiological values conditioned on this status. The work builds on the
Factorial Switching Linear Dynamical System (FSLDS) (Quinn et al., 2009) which
has been previously used in a similar setting. The FSLDS is a generative model,
whereas the DSLDS is a discriminative model. We demonstrate on two real-world
datasets that the DSLDS is able to outperform the FSLDS in most cases of
interest, and that an $\alpha$-mixture of the two models achieves higher
performance than either of the two models separately."
"Making use of predictions is a crucial, but under-explored, area of online
algorithms. This paper studies a class of online optimization problems where we
have external noisy predictions available. We propose a stochastic prediction
error model that generalizes prior models in the learning and stochastic
control communities, incorporates correlation among prediction errors, and
captures the fact that predictions improve as time passes. We prove that
achieving sublinear regret and constant competitive ratio for online algorithms
requires the use of an unbounded prediction window in adversarial settings, but
that under more realistic stochastic prediction error models it is possible to
use Averaging Fixed Horizon Control (AFHC) to simultaneously achieve sublinear
regret and constant competitive ratio in expectation using only a
constant-sized prediction window. Furthermore, we show that the performance of
AFHC is tightly concentrated around its mean."
"To address the contextual bandit problem, we propose an online random forest
algorithm. The analysis of the proposed algorithm is based on the sample
complexity needed to find the optimal decision stump. Then, the decision stumps
are assembled in a random collection of decision trees, Bandit Forest. We show
that the proposed algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The
dependence of the sample complexity upon the number of contextual variables is
logarithmic. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm with respect to
the time horizon is linear. These analytical results allow the proposed
algorithm to be efficient in real applications, where the number of events to
process is huge, and where we expect that some contextual variables, chosen
from a large set, have potentially non- linear dependencies with the rewards.
In the experiments done to illustrate the theoretical analysis, Bandit Forest
obtain promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms."
"In this paper, a novel nonlinear discriminant analysis is proposed.
Experimental results show that the new method provides state of the art
performance when combined with LSVM in terms of training time and accuracy."
"We consider optimization of generalized performance metrics for binary
classification by means of surrogate losses. We focus on a class of metrics,
which are linear-fractional functions of the false positive and false negative
rates (examples of which include $F_{\beta}$-measure, Jaccard similarity
coefficient, AM measure, and many others). Our analysis concerns the following
two-step procedure. First, a real-valued function $f$ is learned by minimizing
a surrogate loss for binary classification on the training sample. It is
assumed that the surrogate loss is a strongly proper composite loss function
(examples of which include logistic loss, squared-error loss, exponential loss,
etc.). Then, given $f$, a threshold $\widehat{\theta}$ is tuned on a separate
validation sample, by direct optimization of the target performance metric. We
show that the regret of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding
$f$ on $\widehat{\theta}$) measured with respect to the target metric is
upperbounded by the regret of $f$ measured with respect to the surrogate loss.
We also extend our results to cover multilabel classification and provide
regret bounds for micro- and macro-averaging measures. Our findings are further
analyzed in a computational study on both synthetic and real data sets."
"We present a machine learning algorithm for building classifiers that are
comprised of a small number of disjunctions of conjunctions (or's of and's). An
example of a classifier of this form is as follows: If X satisfies (x1 = 'blue'
AND x3 = 'middle') OR (x1 = 'blue' AND x2 = '<15') OR (x1 = 'yellow'), then we
predict that Y=1, ELSE predict Y=0. An attribute-value pair is called a literal
and a conjunction of literals is called a pattern. Models of this form have the
advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they produce a set of
conditions that concisely describe a specific class. We present two
probabilistic models for forming a pattern set, one with a Beta-Binomial prior,
and the other with Poisson priors. In both cases, there are prior parameters
that the user can set to encourage the model to have a desired size and shape,
to conform with a domain-specific definition of interpretability. We provide
two scalable MAP inference approaches: a pattern level search, which involves
association rule mining, and a literal level search. We show stronger priors
reduce computation. We apply the Bayesian Or's of And's (BOA) model to predict
user behavior with respect to in-vehicle context-aware personalized recommender
systems."
"We analyze the problem of using Explore-Exploit techniques to improve
precision in multi-result ranking systems such as web search, query
autocompletion and news recommendation. Adopting an exploration policy directly
online, without understanding its impact on the production system, may have
unwanted consequences - the system may sustain large losses, create user
dissatisfaction, or collect exploration data which does not help improve
ranking quality. An offline framework is thus necessary to let us decide what
policy and how we should apply in a production environment to ensure positive
outcome. Here, we describe such an offline framework.
  Using the framework, we study a popular exploration policy - Thompson
sampling. We show that there are different ways of implementing it in
multi-result ranking systems, each having different semantic interpretation and
leading to different results in terms of sustained click-through-rate (CTR)
loss and expected model improvement. In particular, we demonstrate that
Thompson sampling can act as an online learner optimizing CTR, which in some
cases can lead to an interesting outcome: lift in CTR during exploration. The
observation is important for production systems as it suggests that one can get
both valuable exploration data to improve ranking performance on the long run,
and at the same time increase CTR while exploration lasts."
"Music information retrieval faces a challenge in modeling contextualized
musical concepts formulated by a set of co-occurring tags. In this paper, we
investigate the suitability of our recently proposed approach based on a
Siamese neural network in fighting off this challenge. By means of tag features
and probabilistic topic models, the network captures contextualized semantics
from tags via unsupervised learning. This leads to a distributed semantics
space and a potential solution to the out of vocabulary problem which has yet
to be sufficiently addressed. We explore the nature of the resultant
music-based semantics and address computational needs. We conduct experiments
on three public music tag collections -namely, CAL500, MagTag5K and Million
Song Dataset- and compare our approach to a number of state-of-the-art
semantics learning approaches. Comparative results suggest that this approach
outperforms previous approaches in terms of semantic priming and music tag
completion."
"We observe that the standard log likelihood training objective for a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model of time series data is equivalent to a
variational Bayesian training objective, given the proper choice of generative
and inference models. This perspective may motivate extensions to both RNNs and
variational Bayesian models. We propose one such extension, where multiple
particles are used for the hidden state of an RNN, allowing a natural
representation of uncertainty or multimodality."
"Thompson sampling is one of the earliest randomized algorithms for
multi-armed bandits (MAB). In this paper, we extend the Thompson sampling to
Budgeted MAB, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost
is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in
which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a
Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this
case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of
the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the
maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the
distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is $O(\ln B)$, where $B$
denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this
algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general
distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
"Non-linear performance measures are widely used for the evaluation of
learning algorithms. For example, $F$-measure is a commonly used performance
measure for classification problems in machine learning and information
retrieval community. We study the theoretical properties of a subset of
non-linear performance measures called pseudo-linear performance measures which
includes $F$-measure, \emph{Jaccard Index}, among many others. We establish
that many notions of $F$-measures and \emph{Jaccard Index} are pseudo-linear
functions of the per-class false negatives and false positives for binary,
multiclass and multilabel classification. Based on this observation, we present
a general reduction of such performance measure optimization problem to
cost-sensitive classification problem with unknown costs. We then propose an
algorithm with provable guarantees to obtain an approximately optimal
classifier for the $F$-measure by solving a series of cost-sensitive
classification problems. The strength of our analysis is to be valid on any
dataset and any class of classifiers, extending the existing theoretical
results on pseudo-linear measures, which are asymptotic in nature. We also
establish the multi-objective nature of the $F$-score maximization problem by
linking the algorithm with the weighted-sum approach used in multi-objective
optimization. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the relative
importance of cost asymmetry and thresholding when learning linear classifiers
on various $F$-measure optimization tasks."
"Is he/she my type or not? The answer to this question depends on the personal
preferences of the one asking it. The individual process of obtaining a full
answer may generally be difficult and time consuming, but often an approximate
answer can be obtained simply by looking at a photo of the potential match.
Such approximate answers based on visual cues can be produced in a fraction of
a second, a phenomenon that has led to a series of recently successful dating
apps in which users rate others positively or negatively using primarily a
single photo. In this paper we explore using convolutional networks to create a
model of an individual's personal preferences based on rated photos. This
introduced task is difficult due to the large number of variations in profile
pictures and the noise in attractiveness labels. Toward this task we collect a
dataset comprised of $9364$ pictures and binary labels for each. We compare
performance of convolutional models trained in three ways: first directly on
the collected dataset, second with features transferred from a network trained
to predict gender, and third with features transferred from a network trained
on ImageNet. Our findings show that ImageNet features transfer best, producing
a model that attains $68.1\%$ accuracy on the test set and is moderately
successful at predicting matches."
"The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is more expressive than all previously
considered models because of its external memory. It can be viewed as a broader
effort to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that
interacts with them.
  The capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with proper
Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include
memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem
verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model.
However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search
engines, are discrete.
  We examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete
Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape, an
input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to
train a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces to solve simple
algorithmic tasks. Our Interfaces are expressive enough to make our model
Turing complete."
