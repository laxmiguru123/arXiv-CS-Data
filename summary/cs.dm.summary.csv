summary
"This paper analyzes the distribution of cycle lengths in turbo decoding and
low-density parity check (LDPC) graphs. The properties of such cycles are of
significant interest in the context of iterative decoding algorithms which are
based on belief propagation or message passing. We estimate the probability
that there exist no simple cycles of length less than or equal to k at a
randomly chosen node in a turbo decoding graph using a combination of counting
arguments and independence assumptions. For large block lengths n, this
probability is approximately e^{-{2^{k-1}-4}/n}, k>=4. Simulation results
validate the accuracy of the various approximations. For example, for turbo
codes with a block length of 64000, a randomly chosen node has a less than 1%
chance of being on a cycle of length less than or equal to 10, but has a
greater than 99.9% chance of being on a cycle of length less than or equal to
20. The effect of the ""S-random"" permutation is also analyzed and it is shown
that while it eliminates short cycles of length k<8, it does not significantly
affect the overall distribution of cycle lengths. Similar analyses and
simulations are also presented for graphs for LDPC codes. The paper concludes
by commenting briefly on how these results may provide insight into the
practical success of iterative decoding methods."

"The aim of this paper is to present and describe SimLab 1.1 (Simulation
Laboratory for Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis) software designed for
Monte Carlo analysis that is based on performing multiple model evaluations
with probabilistically selected model input. The results of these evaluations
are used to determine both the uncertainty in model predictions and the input
variables that drive this uncertainty. This methodology is essential in
situations where a decision has to be taken based on the model results; typical
examples include risk and emergency management systems, financial analysis and
many others. It is also highly recommended as part of model validation, even
where the models are used for diagnostic purposes, as an element of sound model
building. SimLab allows an exploration of the space of possible alternative
model assumptions and structure on the prediction of the model, thereby testing
both the quality of the model and the robustness of the model based inference."
"In this paper we study random linear systems with $k$ variables per equation
over the finite field GF(2), or equivalently $k$-XOR-CNF formulas. In a
previous paper Creignou and Daud\'e proved that the phase transition for the
consistency (satisfiability) of such systems (formulas) exhibits a sharp
threshold. Here we prove that the phase transition occurs as the number of
equations (clauses) is proportional to the number of variables. For any $k\ge
3$ we establish first estimates for the critical ratio. For $k=3$ we get 0.93
as an upper bound, 0.89 as a lower bound, whereas experiments suggest that the
critical ratio is approximately 0.92."
"Assembly line balancing problems consist in partitioning the work necessary
to assemble a number of products among different stations of an assembly line.
We present a hybrid approach for solving such problems, which combines
constraint programming and integer programming."
"For a given finite class of finite graphs H, a graph G is called a
realization of H if the neighbourhood of its any vertex induces the subgraph
isomorphic to a graph of H. We consider the following problem known as the
Generalized Neighbourhood Problem (GNP): given a finite class of finite graphs
H, does there exist a non-empty graph G that is a realization of H? In fact,
there are two modifications of that problem, namely the finite (the existence
of a finite realization is required) and infinite one (the realization is
required to be infinite). In this paper we show that GNP and its modifications
for all finite classes H of finite graphs are reduced to the same problems with
an additional restriction on H. Namely, the orders of any two graphs of H are
equal and every graph of H has exactly s dominating vertices."
"We know that the marginals in a multinomial distribution are binomial
variates exhibiting a negative correlation. But we can construct two linear
combinations of such marginals in such a way to obtain a positive correlation.
We discuss the restrictions that are to be imposed on the parameters of the
given marginals to accomplish such a result. Next we discuss the regression
function, showing that it is a linear function but not homoscedastic."
"In this paper we propose a simple and efficient strategy to obtain a data
structure generator to accomplish a perfect hash of quite general order
restricted multidimensional arrays named {\em phormas}. The constructor of such
objects gets two parameters as input: an n-vector a of non negative integers
and a boolean function B on the types of order restrictions on the coordinates
of the valid n-vectors bounded by a. At compiler time, the phorma constructor
builds, from the pair a,B, a digraph G(a,B) with a single source s and a single
sink t such that the st-paths are in 1-1 correspondence with the members of the
B-restricted a-bounded array A(a,B). Besides perfectly hashing A(a,B), G(a,B)
is an instance of an NW-family. This permits other useful computational tasks
on it."
"A coloring of a complete bipartite graph is shuffle-preserved if it is the
case that assigning a color $c$ to edges $(u, v)$ and $(u', v')$ enforces the
same color assignment for edges $(u, v')$ and $(u',v)$. (In words, the induced
subgraph with respect to color $c$ is complete.) In this paper, we investigate
a variant of the Ramsey problem for the class of complete bipartite
multigraphs. (By a multigraph we mean a graph in which multiple edges, but no
loops, are allowed.) Unlike the conventional m-coloring scheme in Ramsey theory
which imposes a constraint (i.e., $m$) on the total number of colors allowed in
a graph, we introduce a relaxed version called m-local coloring which only
requires that, for every vertex $v$, the number of colors associated with $v$'s
incident edges is bounded by $m$. Note that the number of colors found in a
graph under $m$-local coloring may exceed m. We prove that given any $n \times
n$ complete bipartite multigraph $G$, every shuffle-preserved $m$-local
coloring displays a monochromatic copy of $K_{p,p}$ provided that $2(p-1)(m-1)
< n$. Moreover, the above bound is tight when (i) $m=2$, or (ii) $n=2^k$ and
$m=3\cdot 2^{k-2}$ for every integer $k\geq 2$. As for the lower bound of $p$,
we show that the existence of a monochromatic $K_{p,p}$ is not guaranteed if
$p> \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil$. Finally, we give a generalization for
$k$-partite graphs and a method applicable to general graphs. Many conclusions
found in $m$-local coloring can be inferred to similar results of $m$-coloring."
"The relationship between the length of a word and the maximum length of its
unbordered factors is investigated in this paper. Consider a finite word w of
length n. We call a word bordered, if it has a proper prefix which is also a
suffix of that word. Let f(w) denote the maximum length of all unbordered
factors of w, and let p(w) denote the period of w. Clearly, f(w) < p(w)+1.
  We establish that f(w) = p(w), if w has an unbordered prefix of length f(w)
and n > 2f(w)-2. This bound is tight and solves the stronger version of a 21
years old conjecture by Duval. It follows from this result that, in general, n
> 3f(w)-3 implies f(w) = p(w) which gives an improved bound for the question
asked by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger in 1979."
"The bandwidth of a graph is the labeling of vertices with minimum maximum
edge difference. For many graph families this is NP-complete. A classic result
computes the bandwidth for the hypercube. We generalize this result to give
sharp lower bounds for products of cliques. This problem turns out to be
equivalent to one in communication over multiple channels in which channels can
fail and the information sent over those channels is lost. The goal is to
create an encoding that minimizes the difference between the received and the
original information while having as little redundancy as possible. Berger-Wolf
and Reingold [2] have considered the problem for the equal size cliques (or
equal capacity channels). This paper presents a tight lower bound and an
algorithm for constructing the labeling for the product of any number of
arbitrary size cliques."
"We characterize the set of planar locally finite Cayley graphs, and give a
finite representation of these graphs by a special kind of finite state
automata called labeling schemes. As a result, we are able to enumerate and
describe all planar locally finite Cayley graphs of a given degree. This
analysis allows us to solve the problem of decision of the locally finite
planarity for a word-problem-decidable presentation.
  Keywords: vertex-transitive, Cayley graph, planar graph, tiling, labeling
scheme"
"Characterisations of interval graphs, comparability graphs, co-comparability
graphs, permutation graphs, and split graphs in terms of linear orderings of
the vertex set are presented. As an application, it is proved that interval
graphs, co-comparability graphs, AT-free graphs, and split graphs have
bandwidth bounded by their maximum degree."
"Based on Jensen formulae and the second kind of Chebyshev polynomials,
another proof is presented for an extension of a curious binomial identity due

"Rule k is a localized approximation algorithm that finds a small connected
dominating set in a graph. We estimate the expected size of the Rule k
dominating set for the model of random unit disk graphs constructed from n
random points in an s_n by s_n square region of the plane."
"Li and Wu proposed Rule 2, a localized approximation algorithm that attempts
to find a small connected dominating set in a graph. Here we study the
asymptotic performance of Rule 2 on random unit disk graphs formed from n
random points in an s_n by s_n square region of the plane. If s_n is below the
threshold for connectivity, then Rule 2 produces a dominating set whose
expected size is O(n/(loglog n)^{3/2}). We conjecture that this bound is not
optimal."
"We consider functions mapping non-negative integers to non-negative real
numbers such that a and a+n are mapped to values at least 1/n apart. In this
paper we use a novel method to construct such a function. We conjecture that
the supremum of the generated function is optimal and pose some unsolved
problems."
"Due to the appearance of uncontrollable events in discrete event systems, one
may wish to replace the behavior leading to the uncontrollability of
pre-specified language by some quite similar one. To capture this similarity,
we introduce metric to traditional supervisory control theory and generalize
the concept of original controllability to $\ld$-controllability, where $\ld$
indicates the similarity degree of two languages. A necessary and sufficient
condition for a language to be $\ld$-controllable is provided. We then examine
some properties of $\ld$-controllable languages and present an approach to
optimizing a realization."
"We consider the class of the topologically locally finite (in short TLF)
planar vertex-transitive graphs, a class containing in particular all the
one-ended planar Cayley graphs and the normal transitive tilings. We
characterize these graphs with a finite local representation and a special kind
of finite state automaton named labeling scheme. As a result, we are able to
enumerate and describe all TLF-planar vertex-transitive graphs of any given
degree. Also, we are able decide to whether any TLF-planar transitive graph is
Cayley or not."
"In this paper we examine the classes of graphs whose $K_n$-complements are
trees and quasi-threshold graphs and derive formulas for their number of
spanning trees; for a subgraph $H$ of $K_n$, the $K_n$-complement of $H$ is the
graph $K_n-H$ which is obtained from $K_n$ by removing the edges of $H$. Our
proofs are based on the complement spanning-tree matrix theorem, which
expresses the number of spanning trees of a graph as a function of the
determinant of a matrix that can be easily constructed from the adjacency
relation of the graph. Our results generalize previous results and extend the
family of graphs of the form $K_n-H$ admitting formulas for the number of their
spanning trees."
"A sense of direction is an edge labeling on graphs that follows a globally
consistent scheme and is known to considerably reduce the complexity of several
distributed problems. In this paper, we study a particular instance of sense of
direction, called a chordal sense of direction (CSD). In special, we identify
the class of k-regular graphs that admit a CSD with exactly k labels (a minimal
CSD). We prove that connected graphs in this class are Hamiltonian and that the
class is equivalent to that of circulant graphs, presenting an efficient
(polynomial-time) way of recognizing it when the graphs' degree k is fixed."
"Here I share a few notes I used in various course lectures, talks, etc. Some
may be just calculations that in the textbooks are more complicated, scattered,
or less specific; others may be simple observations I found useful or curious."
"We consider the class A of graphs that contain no odd hole, no antihole, and
no ``prism'' (a graph consisting of two disjoint triangles with three disjoint
paths between them). We show that the coloring algorithm found by the second
and fourth author can be implemented in time O(n^2m) for any graph in A with n
vertices and m edges, thereby improving on the complexity proposed in the
original paper."
"Let $G$ be an Eulerian directed graph with an arc-labeling such that arcs
going out from the same vertex have different labels. In this work, we present
an algorithm to construct the Eulerian trail starting at an arbitrary vertex
$v$ of minimum lexicographical label among labels of all Eulerian trails
starting at this vertex.
  We also show an application of this algorithm to construct the minimal de
Bruijn sequence of a language."
"A cycle double cover (CDC) of an undirected graph is a collection of the
graph's cycles such that every edge of the graph belongs to exactly two cycles.
We describe a constructive method for generating all the cubic graphs that have
a 6-CDC (a CDC in which every cycle has length 6). As an application of the
method, we prove that all such graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle. A sense of
direction is an edge labeling on graphs that follows a globally consistent
scheme and is known to considerably reduce the complexity of several
distributed problems. In [9], a particular instance of sense of direction,
called a chordal sense of direction (CSD), is studied and the class of
k-regular graphs that admit a CSD with exactly k labels (a minimal CSD) is
analyzed. We now show that nearly all the cubic graphs in this class have a
6-CDC, the only exception being K4."
"We consider the problem of minimizing the makespan in a flowshop involving
maximal and minimal time lags. Time lag constraints generalize the classical
precedence constraints between operations. We assume that such constraints are
only defined between operations of the same job. We propose a solution method
and present several extensions."
"The following optimization problem was introduced in \cite{gutinDAM}, where
it was motivated by a real-world problem in defence logistics. Suppose we are
given a pair of digraphs $D,H$ and a positive cost $c_i(u)$ for each $u\in
V(D)$ and $i\in V(H)$. The cost of a homomorphism $f$ of $D$ to $H$ is
$\sum_{u\in V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. For a fixed digraph $H$, the minimum cost
homomorphism problem for $H$, MinHOMP($H$), is stated as follows: For an input
digraph $D$ and costs $c_i(u)$ for each $u\in V(D)$ and $i\in V(H)$, verify
whether there is a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if it exists, find such a
homomorphism of minimum cost.
  We obtain dichotomy classifications of the computational complexity of the
list homomorphism problem and MinHOMP($H$), when $H$ is a semicomplete digraph
(a digraph in which every two vertices have at least one arc between them). Our
dichotomy for the list homomorphism problem coincides with the one obtained by
Bang-Jensen, Hell and MacGillivray in 1988 for the homomorphism problem when
$H$ is a semicomplete digraph: both problems are polynomial solvable if $H$ has
at most one cycle; otherwise, both problems are NP-complete. The dichotomy for
\MiP is different: the problem is polynomial time solvable if $H$ is acyclic or
$H$ is a cycle of length 2 or 3; otherwise, the problem is NP-hard."
"The pre-coloring extension problem consists, given a graph $G$ and a subset
of nodes to which some colors are already assigned, in finding a coloring of
$G$ with the minimum number of colors which respects the pre-coloring
assignment. This can be reduced to the usual coloring problem on a certain
contracted graph. We prove that pre-coloring extension is polynomial for
complements of Meyniel graphs. We answer a question of Hujter and Tuza by
showing that ``PrExt perfect'' graphs are exactly the co-Meyniel graphs, which
also generalizes results of Hujter and Tuza and of Hertz. Moreover we show
that, given a co-Meyniel graph, the corresponding contracted graph belongs to a
restricted class of perfect graphs (``co-Artemis'' graphs, which are
``co-perfectly contractile'' graphs), whose perfectness is easier to establish
than the strong perfect graph theorem. However, the polynomiality of our
algorithm still depends on the ellipsoid method for coloring perfect graphs."
"A Meyniel obstruction is an odd cycle with at least five vertices and at most
one chord. A graph is Meyniel if and only if it has no Meyniel obstruction as
an induced subgraph. Here we give a O(n^2) algorithm that, for any graph, finds
either a clique and coloring of the same size or a Meyniel obstruction. We also
give a O(n^3) algorithm that, for any graph, finds either aneasily recognizable
strong stable set or a Meyniel obstruction."
"Let $S\_{N}(P)$ be the poset obtained by adding a dummy vertex on each
diagonal edge of the $N$'s of a finite poset $P$. We show that
$S\_{N}(S\_{N}(P))$ is $N$-free. It follows that this poset is the smallest
$N$-free barycentric subdivision of the diagram of $P$, poset whose existence
was proved by P.A. Grillet. This is also the poset obtained by the algorithm
starting with $P\_0:=P$ and consisting at step $m$ of adding a dummy vertex on
a diagonal edge of some $N$ in $P\_m$, proving that the result of this
algorithm does not depend upon the particular choice of the diagonal edge
choosen at each step. These results are linked to drawing of posets."
"For digraphs $D$ and $H$, a mapping $f: V(D)\dom V(H)$ is a {\em homomorphism
of $D$ to $H$} if $uv\in A(D)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H).$ For a fixed directed
or undirected graph $H$ and an input graph $D$, the problem of verifying
whether there exists a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ has been studied in a large
number of papers. We study an optimization version of this decision problem.
Our optimization problem is motivated by a real-world problem in defence
logistics and was introduced very recently by the authors and M. Tso.
  Suppose we are given a pair of digraphs $D,H$ and a positive integral cost
$c_i(u)$ for each $u\in V(D)$ and $i\in V(H)$. The cost of a homomorphism $f$
of $D$ to $H$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. Let $H$ be a fixed digraph. The
minimum cost homomorphism problem for $H$, MinHOMP($H$), is stated as follows:
For input digraph $D$ and costs $c_i(u)$ for each $u\in V(D)$ and $i\in V(H)$,
verify whether there is a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if it does exist,
find such a homomorphism of minimum cost. In our previous paper we obtained a
dichotomy classification of the time complexity of \MiP for $H$ being a
semicomplete digraph. In this paper we extend the classification to
semicomplete $k$-partite digraphs, $k\ge 3$, and obtain such a classification
for bipartite tournaments."
"Many well-known combinatorial optimization problems can be stated over the
set of acyclic orientations of an undirected graph. For example, acyclic
orientations with certain diameter constraints are closely related to the
optimal solutions of the vertex coloring and frequency assignment problems. In
this paper we introduce a linear programming formulation of acyclic
orientations with path constraints, and discuss its use in the solution of the
vertex coloring problem and some versions of the frequency assignment problem.
A study of the polytope associated with the formulation is presented, including
proofs of which constraints of the formulation are facet-defining and the
introduction of new classes of valid inequalities."
"In this paper we studied generalization of Hermitian function field proposed
by A.Garcia and H.Stichtenoth. We calculated a Weierstrass semigroup of the
point at infinity for the case q=2, r>=3. It turned out that unlike Hermitian
case, we have already three generators for the semigroup. We then applied this
result to codes, constructed on generalized Hermitian function fields. Further,
we applied results of C.Kirfel and R.Pellikaan to estimating a Feng-Rao
designed distance for GH-codes, which improved on Goppa designed distance.
Next, we studied the question of codes dual to GH-codes. We identified that the
duals are also GH-codes and gave an explicit formula. We concluded with some
computational results. In particular, a new record-giving [32,16,>=12]-code
over GF(8) was presented."
"We determine the value of the Ramsey number $R(W_5,K_5)$ to be 27, where $W_5
= K_1 + C_4$ is the 4-spoked wheel of order 5. This solves one of the four
remaining open cases in the tables given in 1989 by George R. T. Hendry, which
included the Ramsey numbers $R(G,H)$ for all pairs of graphs $G$ and $H$ having
five vertices, except seven entries. In addition, we show that there exists a
unique up to isomorphism critical Ramsey graph for $W_5$ versus $K_5$. Our
results are based on computer algorithms."
"A challenging problem is to find an algorithm to decide whether a morphism is
k-power-free. We provide such an algorithm when k >= 3 for uniform morphisms
showing that in such a case, contrarily to the general case, there exist finite
test-sets for k-power-freeness."
"We study the problem of generating connected random graphs with no self-loops
or multiple edges and that, in addition, have a given degree sequence. The
generation method we focus on is the edge-switching Markov-chain method, whose
functioning depends on a parameter w related to the method's core operation of
an edge switch. We analyze two existing heuristics for adjusting w during the
generation of a graph and show that they result in a Markov chain whose
stationary distribution is uniform, thus ensuring that generation occurs
uniformly at random. We also introduce a novel w-adjusting heuristic which,
even though it does not always lead to a Markov chain, is still guaranteed to
converge to the uniform distribution under relatively mild conditions. We
report on extensive computer experiments comparing the three heuristics'
performance at generating random graphs whose node degrees are distributed as
power laws."
"We characterize all quasiperiodic Sturmian words: a Sturmian word is not
quasiperiodic if and only if it is a Lyndon word. Moreover, we study links
between Sturmian morphisms and quasiperiodicity."
A Turing machine that computes Fibonacci numbers is described.
"We consider the problem of covering a graph with a given number of induced
subgraphs so that the maximum number of vertices in each subgraph is minimized.
We prove NP-completeness of the problem, prove lower bounds, and give
approximation algorithms for certain graph classes."
"The Mn-matrix was defined by Mohan [20] in which he has shown a method of
constructing (1,-1)-matrices and studied some of their properties. The
(1,-1)-matrices were constructed and studied by Cohn [5],Wang [33], Ehrlich [8]
and Ehrlich and Zeller[9]. But in this paper, while giving some resemblances of
this matrix with Hadamard matrix, and by naming it as M-matrix, we show how to
construct partially balanced incomplete block (PBIB) designs and some regular
bipartite graphs by it. We have considered two types of these M- matrices. Also
we will make a mention of certain applications of these M-matrices in signal
and communication processing, and network systems and end with some open
problems."
"An arrangement of s elements in s rows and s columns, such that no element
repeats more than once in each row and each column is called a Latin square of
order s. If two Latin squares of the same order superimposed one on the other
and in the resultant array if each ordered pair occurs once and only once then
they are called othogonal Latin Squares. A frequency square is an nxn matrix,
such that each element from the list of n elements, occurs t times in each row
and in each column. These two concepts lead to a new third concept called as t
orthogonal latin squares, where from a set of m orthogonal Latin squares, if t
orthogonal Latin squares are superimposed and each ordered t tuple in the
resultant array occurs once and only once then it is t othogonal Latin square.
In this paper it is proposed to construct such t othogonal latin squares"
"Some binary matrices like (1,-1) and (1,0) were studied by many authors like
Cohn, Wang, Ehlich and Ehlich and Zeller, and Mohan, Kageyama, Lee, and Gao. In
this recent paper by Mohan et al considered the M-matrices of Type I and II by
studying some of their properties and applications. In the present paper they
discussed the M-matrices of Type III, and studied their properties and
applications. They gave some constructions of SPBIB designs and some
corresponding M-graphs, which are being constructed by it. This is the
continuation of our earlier research work in this direction, and these papers
establish the importance of non-orthogonal matrices as well."
"In this note, while giving an overview of the state of art of the well known
Hadamard conjecture, which is more than a century old and now it has been
established by using the methods given in the two papers by Mohan et al [6,7]."
"By making use of the generalized concept of orthogonality in Latin squares,
certain t-partite graphs have been constructed and a suggestion for a net work
system and some applications have been made."
"We introduce a problem class we call Polynomial Constraint Satisfaction
Problems, or PCSP. Where the usual CSPs from computer science and optimization
have real-valued score functions, and partition functions from physics have
monomials, PCSP has scores that are arbitrary multivariate formal polynomials,
or indeed take values in an arbitrary ring.
  Although PCSP is much more general than CSP, remarkably, all (exact,
exponential-time) algorithms we know of for 2-CSP (where each score depends on
at most 2 variables) extend to 2-PCSP, at the expense of just a polynomial
factor in running time. Specifically, we extend the reduction-based algorithm
of Scott and Sorkin; the specialization of that approach to sparse random
instances, where the algorithm runs in polynomial expected time;
dynamic-programming algorithms based on tree decompositions; and the
split-and-list matrix-multiplication algorithm of Williams.
  This gives the first polynomial-space exact algorithm more efficient than
exhaustive enumeration for the well-studied problems of finding a minimum
bisection of a graph, and calculating the partition function of an Ising model,
and the most efficient algorithm known for certain instances of Maximum
Independent Set. Furthermore, PCSP solves both optimization and counting
versions of a wide range of problems, including all CSPs, and thus enables
samplers including uniform sampling of optimal solutions and Gibbs sampling of
all solutions."
"The class $(r,2)$-CSP, or simply Max 2-CSP, consists of constraint
satisfaction problems with at most two $r$-valued variables per clause. For
instances with $n$ variables and $m$ binary clauses, we present an $O(n
r^{5+19m/100})$-time algorithm which is the fastest polynomial-space algorithm
for many problems in the class, including Max Cut. The method also proves a
treewidth bound $\tw(G) \leq (13/75+o(1))m$, which gives a faster Max 2-CSP
algorithm that uses exponential space: running in time
$\Ostar{2^{(13/75+o(1))m}}$, this is fastest for most problems in Max 2-CSP.
Parametrizing in terms of $n$ rather than $m$, for graphs of average degree $d$
we show a simple algorithm running time $\Ostar{2^{(1-\frac{2}{d+1})n}}$, the
fastest polynomial-space algorithm known.
  In combination with ``Polynomial CSPs'' introduced in a companion paper,
these algorithms also allow (with an additional polynomial-factor overhead in
space and time) counting and sampling, and the solution of problems like Max
Bisection that escape the usual CSP framework.
  Linear programming is key to the design as well as the analysis of the
algorithms."
"The notion of almost periodicity nontrivially generalizes the notion of
periodicity. Strongly almost periodic sequences (=uniformly recurrent infinite
words) first appeared in the field of symbolic dynamics, but then turned out to
be interesting in connection with computer science. The paper studies the class
of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences (i. e., becoming strongly
almost periodic after deleting some prefix). We prove that the property of
eventual strong almost periodicity is preserved under the mappings done by
finite automata and finite transducers. The class of almost periodic sequences
includes the class of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences. We prove
this inclusion to be strict."
"In this paper we have discussed different possible orthogonalities in
matrices, namely orthogonal, quasi-orthogonal, semi-orthogonal and
non-orthogonal matrices including completely positive matrices, while giving
some of their constructions besides studying some of their properties."
"Abstrct: In this note, by considering fractionally linear functions over a
finite field and consequently developing an abstract sequence, we study some of
its properties."
"Sharir and Welzl introduced an abstract framework for optimization problems,
called LP-type problems or also generalized linear programming problems, which
proved useful in algorithm design. We define a new, and as we believe, simpler
and more natural framework: violator spaces, which constitute a proper
generalization of LP-type problems. We show that Clarkson's randomized
algorithms for low-dimensional linear programming work in the context of
violator spaces. For example, in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm
for the P-matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with a constant
number of blocks. We also give two new characterizations of LP-type problems:
they are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces, as well as to concrete LP-type
problems (informally, the constraints in a concrete LP-type problem are subsets
of a linearly ordered ground set, and the value of a set of constraints is the
minimum of its intersection)."
"A plane graph is l-facially k-colourable if its vertices can be coloured with
k colours such that any two distinct vertices on a facial segment of length at
most l are coloured differently. We prove that every plane graph is 3-facially
11-colourable. As a consequence, we derive that every 2-connected plane graph
with maximum face-size at most 7 is cyclically 11-colourable. These two bounds
are for one off from those that are proposed by the (3l+1)-Conjecture and the
Cyclic Conjecture."
"The paper studies different variants of almost periodicity notion. We
introduce the class of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences where some
suffix is strongly almost periodic (=uniformly recurrent). The class of almost
periodic sequences includes the class of eventually strongly almost periodic
sequences, and we prove this inclusion to be strict. We prove that the class of
eventually strongly almost periodic sequences is closed under finite automata
mappings and finite transducers. Moreover, an effective form of this result is
presented. Finally we consider some algorithmic questions concerning almost
periodicity."
"We show for an arbitrary $\ell_p$ norm that the property that a random
geometric graph $\mathcal G(n,r)$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle exhibits a sharp
threshold at $r=r(n)=\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\alpha_p n}}$, where $\alpha_p$ is the
area of the unit disk in the $\ell_p$ norm. The proof is constructive and
yields a linear time algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle of $\RG$ a.a.s.,
provided $r=r(n)\ge\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{(\alpha_p -\epsilon)n}}$ for some fixed
$\epsilon > 0$."
"We characterize clique trees of a chordal graph in their relation to
simplicial vertices and perfect sequences of maximal cliques. We investigate
boundary cliques defined by Shibata and clarify their relation to endpoints of
clique trees. Next we define a symmetric binary relation between the set of
clique trees and the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques. We describe
the relation as a bipartite graph and prove that the bipartite graph is always
connected. Lastly we consider to characterize chordal graphs from the aspect of
non-uniqueness of clique trees."
"Given a set I of word, the set of all words obtained by the shuffle of
(copies of) words of I is naturally provided with a partial order. In [FS05],
the authors have opened the problem of the characterization of the finite sets
I such that the order is a well quasi-order . In this paper we give an answer
in the case when I consists of a single word w."
"A unit cube in $k$ dimensional space (or \emph{$k$-cube} in short) is defined
as the Cartesian product $R_1\times R_2\times...\times R_k$ where $R_i$(for
$1\leq i\leq k$) is a closed interval of the form $[a_i,a_i+1]$ on the real
line. A $k$-cube representation of a graph $G$ is a mapping of the vertices of
$G$ to $k$-cubes such that two vertices in $G$ are adjacent if and only if
their corresponding $k$-cubes have a non-empty intersection. The
\emph{cubicity} of $G$, denoted as $\cubi(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$
has a $k$-cube representation. Roberts \cite{Roberts} showed that for any graph
$G$ on $n$ vertices, $\cubi(G)\leq 2n/3$. Many NP-complete graph problems have
polynomial time deterministic algorithms or have good approximation ratios in
graphs of low cubicity. In most of these algorithms, computing a low
dimensional cube representation of the given graph is usually the first step.
  We present an efficient algorithm to compute the $k$-cube representation of
$G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ in $O(\Delta \ln b)$ dimensions where $b$ is
the bandwidth of $G$. Bandwidth of $G$ is at most $n$ and can be much lower.
The algorithm takes as input a bandwidth ordering of the vertices in $G$.
Though computing the bandwidth ordering of vertices for a graph is NP-hard,
there are heuristics that perform very well in practice. Even theoretically,
there is an $O(\log^4 n)$ approximation algorithm for computing the bandwidth
ordering of a graph using which our algorithm can produce a $k$-cube
representation of any given graph in $k=O(\Delta(\ln b + \ln\ln n))$
dimensions. Both the bounds on cubicity are shown to be tight upto a factor of
$O(\log\log n)$."
"We study arithmetical and combinatorial properties of $\beta$-integers for
$\beta$ being the root of the equation $x^2=mx-n, m,n \in \mathbb N, m \geq
n+2\geq 3$. We determine with the accuracy of $\pm 1$ the maximal number of
$\beta$-fractional positions, which may arise as a result of addition of two
$\beta$-integers. For the infinite word $u_\beta$ coding distances between
consecutive $\beta$-integers, we determine precisely also the balance. The word
$u_\beta$ is the fixed point of the morphism $A \to A^{m-1}B$ and $B\to
A^{m-n-1}B$. In the case $n=1$ the corresponding infinite word $u_\beta$ is
sturmian and therefore 1-balanced. On the simplest non-sturmian example with
$n\geq 2$, we illustrate how closely the balance and arithmetical properties of
$\beta$-integers are related."
"We propose a new algebraic framework to discuss and classify recognizable
tree languages, and to characterize interesting classes of such languages. Our
algebraic tool, called preclones, encompasses the classical notion of syntactic
Sigma-algebra or minimal tree automaton, but adds new expressivity to it. The
main result in this paper is a variety theorem \`{a} la Eilenberg, but we also
discuss important examples of logically defined classes of recognizable tree
languages, whose characterization and decidability was established in recent
papers (by Benedikt and S\'{e}goufin, and by Bojanczyk and Walukiewicz) and can
be naturally formulated in terms of pseudovarieties of preclones. Finally, this
paper constitutes the foundation for another paper by the same authors, where
first-order definable tree languages receive an algebraic characterization."
"This paper addresses the basic question of how well can a tree approximate
distances of a metric space or a graph. Given a graph, the problem of
constructing a spanning tree in a graph which strongly preserves distances in
the graph is a fundamental problem in network design. We present scaling
distortion embeddings where the distortion scales as a function of $\epsilon$,
with the guarantee that for each $\epsilon$ the distortion of a fraction
$1-\epsilon$ of all pairs is bounded accordingly. Such a bound implies, in
particular, that the \emph{average distortion} and $\ell_q$-distortions are
small. Specifically, our embeddings have \emph{constant} average distortion and
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ $\ell_2$-distortion. This follows from the following
results: we prove that any metric space embeds into an ultrametric with scaling
distortion $O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. For the graph setting we prove that any
weighted graph contains a spanning tree with scaling distortion
$O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. These bounds are tight even for embedding in arbitrary
trees.
  For probabilistic embedding into spanning trees we prove a scaling distortion
of $\tilde{O}(\log^2 (1/\epsilon))$, which implies \emph{constant}
$\ell_q$-distortion for every fixed $q<\infty$."
"The notion of 'presentation', as used in combinatorial group theory, is
applied to coded character sets(CCSs) - sets which facilitate the interchange
of messages in a digital computer network(DCN) . By grouping each element of
the set into two portions and using the idea of group presentation(whereby a
group is specified by its set of generators and its set of relators), the
presentation of a CCS is described. This is illustrated using the Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code(EBCDIC) which is one of the most popular
CCSs in DCNs.
  Key words: Group presentation, coded character set, digital computer network"
"We bound the hereditary discrepancy of a hypergraph $\HH$ in two colors in
terms of its hereditary discrepancy in $c$ colors. We show that
$\herdisc(\HH,2) \le K c \herdisc(\HH,c)$, where $K$ is some absolute constant.
This bound is sharp."
"We use the concept of a Kirchhoff resistor network (alternatively random walk
on a network) to probe connected graphs and produce symmetry revealing
canonical labelings of the graph(s) nodes and edges."
"Our theme bases on the classical Hanoi Towers Problem. In this paper we will
define a new problem, permitting some positions, that were not legal in the
classical problem. Our goal is to find an optimal (shortest possible) sequence
of discs' moves. Besides that, we will research all versions of 3-pegs
classical problem with some special constraints, when some types of moves are
disallowed."
"In this work we deal with a mechanism for process simulation called a
NonDeterministic Stochastic Activity Network (NDSAN). An NDSAN consists
basically of a set of activities along with precedence relations involving
these activities, which determine their order of execution. Activity durations
are stochastic, given by continuous, nonnegative random variables. The
nondeterministic behavior of an NDSAN is based on two additional possibilities:
(i) by associating choice probabilities with groups of activities, some
branches of execution may not be taken; (ii) by allowing iterated executions of
groups of activities according to predetermined probabilities, the number of
times an activity must be executed is not determined a priori. These properties
lead to a rich variety of activity networks, capable of modeling many real
situations in process engineering, project design, and troubleshooting. We
describe a recursive simulation algorithm for NDSANs, whose repeated execution
produces a close approximation to the probability distribution of the
completion time of the entire network. We also report on real-world case
studies."
"The string splicing was introduced by Tom Head which stands as an abstract
model for the DNA recombination under the influence of restriction enzymes. The
complex chemical process of three dimensional molecules in three dimensional
space can be modeled using graphs. The graph splicing systems which were
studied so far, can only be applied to a particular type of graphs which could
be interpreted as linear or circular graphs. In this paper, we take a different
and a novel approach to splice two graphs and introduce a splicing system for
graphs that can be applied to all types of graphs. Splicing two graphs can be
thought of as a new operation, among the graphs, that generates many new graphs
from the given two graphs. Taking a different line of thinking, some of the
graph theoretical results of the splicing are studied."
"We prove that episturmian words and Arnoux-Rauzy sequences can be
characterized using a local balance property. We also give a new
characterization of epistandard words and show that the set of finite words
that are not factors of an episturmian word is not context-free."
"Based on Lyndon words, a new Sudoku-like puzzle is presented and some
relative theoretical questions are proposed."
"In this work we introduce Dynamic Random Geometric Graphs as a basic rough
model for mobile wireless sensor networks, where communication distances are
set to the known threshold for connectivity of static random geometric graphs.
We provide precise asymptotic results for the expected length of the
connectivity and disconnectivity periods of the network. We believe the formal
tools developed in this work could be of use in future studies in more concrete
settings. In addition, for static random geometric graphs at the threshold for
connectivity, we provide asymptotic expressions on the probability of existence
of components according to their sizes."

"Let $F^n$ be the binary $n$-cube, or binary Hamming space of dimension $n$,
endowed with the Hamming distance, and ${\cal E}^n$ (respectively, ${\cal
O}^n$) the set of vectors with even (respectively, odd) weight. For $r\geq 1$
and $x\in F^n$, we denote by $B_r(x)$ the ball of radius $r$ and centre $x$. A
code $C\subseteq F^n$ is said to be $r$-identifying if the sets $B_r(x) \cap
C$, $x\in F^n$, are all nonempty and distinct. A code $C\subseteq {\cal E}^n$
is said to be $r$-discriminating if the sets $B_r(x) \cap C$, $x\in {\cal
O}^n$, are all nonempty and distinct. We show that the two definitions, which
were given for general graphs, are equivalent in the case of the Hamming space,
in the following sense: for any odd $r$, there is a bijection between the set
of $r$-identifying codes in $F^n$ and the set of $r$-discriminating codes in
$F^{n+1}$. We then extend previous studies on constructive upper bounds for the
minimum cardinalities of identifying codes in the Hamming space."
"On-line chain partition is a two-player game between Spoiler and Algorithm.
Spoiler presents a partially ordered set, point by point. Algorithm assigns
incoming points (immediately and irrevocably) to the chains which constitute a
chain partition of the order. The value of the game for orders of width $w$ is
a minimum number $\fVal(w)$ such that Algorithm has a strategy using at most
$\fVal(w)$ chains on orders of width at most $w$. We analyze the chain
partition game for up-growing semi-orders. Surprisingly, the golden ratio comes
into play and the value of the game is $\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\; w
\rfloor$."
"This paper considers heuristics for well known resource-constrained project
scheduling problem (RCPSP). First a feasible schedule is constructed using
randomized best insertion algorithm. The construction is followed by a local
search where a new solution is generated as follows: first we randomly delete m
activities from the list, which are then reinserted in the list in consecutive
order. At the end of run, the schedule with the minimum makespan is selected.
Experimental work shows very good results on standard test instances found in
PSPLIB"
"Cellular automata are often used to model systems in physics, social
sciences, biology that are inherently asynchronous. Over the past 20 years,
studies have demonstrated that the behavior of cellular automata drastically
changed under asynchronous updates. Still, the few mathematical analyses of
asynchronism focus on one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata, either
on single examples or on specific classes. As for other classic dynamical
systems in physics, extending known methods from one- to two-dimensional
systems is a long lasting challenging problem.
  In this paper, we address the problem of analysing an apparently simple 2D
asynchronous cellular automaton: 2D Minority where each cell, when fired,
updates to the minority state of its neighborhood. Our experiments reveal that
in spite of its simplicity, the minority rule exhibits a quite complex response
to asynchronism. By focusing on the fully asynchronous regime, we are however
able to describe completely the asymptotic behavior of this dynamics as long as
the initial configuration satisfies some natural constraints. Besides these
technical results, we have strong reasons to believe that our techniques
relying on defining an energy function from the transition table of the
automaton may be extended to the wider class of threshold automata."
"For a given connected graph G on n vertices and m edges, we prove that its
independence number is at least (2m+n+2-sqrt(sqr(2m+n+2)-16sqr(n)))/8."
"In the minimum sum edge coloring problem, we aim to assign natural numbers to
edges of a graph, so that adjacent edges receive different numbers, and the sum
of the numbers assigned to the edges is minimum. The {\em chromatic edge
strength} of a graph is the minimum number of colors required in a minimum sum
edge coloring of this graph. We study the case of multicycles, defined as
cycles with parallel edges, and give a closed-form expression for the chromatic
edge strength of a multicycle, thereby extending a theorem due to Berge. It is
shown that the minimum sum can be achieved with a number of colors equal to the
chromatic index. We also propose simple algorithms for finding a minimum sum
edge coloring of a multicycle. Finally, these results are generalized to a
large family of minimum cost coloring problems."
"This paper describes an optimization model for setting bid levels for certain
types of advertisements on web pages. This model is non-convex, but we are able
to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly using branch and cut
open-source software. The financial benefits obtained using the prototype
system have been substantial."
"A generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequence is one over a finite alphabet that
contains no subsequences isomorphic to a fixed forbidden subsequence. One of
the fundamental problems in this area is bounding (asymptotically) the maximum
length of such sequences. Following Klazar, let Ex(\sigma,n) be the maximum
length of a sequence over an alphabet of size n avoiding subsequences
isomorphic to \sigma. It has been proved that for every \sigma, Ex(\sigma,n) is
either linear or very close to linear; in particular it is O(n
2^{\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}), where \alpha is the inverse-Ackermann function and O(1)
depends on \sigma. However, very little is known about the properties of \sigma
that induce superlinearity of \Ex(\sigma,n).
  In this paper we exhibit an infinite family of independent superlinear
forbidden subsequences. To be specific, we show that there are 17 prototypical
superlinear forbidden subsequences, some of which can be made arbitrarily long
through a simple padding operation. Perhaps the most novel part of our
constructions is a new succinct code for representing superlinear forbidden
subsequences."
"A graph is called matching covered if for its every edge there is a maximum
matching containing it. It is shown that minimal matching covered graphs
contain a perfect matching."
"I prove that in a tree in which the distance between any two endpoints is
even, there is a maximum proper partial 0-1 coloring such that the edges
colored by 0 form a maximum matching."
"For bipartite graphs the NP-completeness is proved for the problem of
existence of maximum matching which removal leads to a graph with given
lower(upper)bound for the cardinality of its maximum matching."
"For an arbitrary tree we investigate the problems of constructing a maximum
matching which minimizes or maximizes the cardinality of a maximum matching of
the graph obtained from original one by its removal and present corresponding
polynomial algorithms."
"In the classical s-t network reliability problem a fixed network G is given
including two designated vertices s and t (called terminals). The edges are
subject to independent random failure, and the task is to compute the
probability that s and t are connected in the resulting network, which is known
to be #P-complete. In this paper we are interested in approximating the s-t
reliability in case of a directed acyclic original network G. We introduce and
analyze a specialized version of the Monte-Carlo algorithm given by Karp and
Luby. For the case of uniform edge failure probabilities, we give a worst-case
bound on the number of samples that have to be drawn to obtain an epsilon-delta
approximation, being sharper than the original upper bound. We also derive a
variance reduction of the estimator which reduces the expected number of
iterations to perform to achieve the desired accuracy when applied in
conjunction with different stopping rules. Initial computational results on two
types of random networks (directed acyclic Delaunay graphs and a slightly
modified version of a classical random graph) with up to one million vertices
are presented. These results show the advantage of the introduced Monte-Carlo
approach compared to direct simulation when small reliabilities have to be
estimated and demonstrate its applicability on large-scale instances."
"We introduce and study a new model: 0-automatic queues. Roughly, 0-automatic
queues are characterized by a special buffering mechanism evolving like a
random walk on some infinite group or monoid. The salient result is that all
stable 0-automatic queues have a product form stationary distribution and a
Poisson output process. When considering the two simplest and extremal cases of
0-automatic queues, we recover the simple M/M/1 queue, and Gelenbe's G-queue
with positive and negative customers."
"An effective $p$-adic encoding of dendrograms is presented through an
explicit embedding into the Bruhat-Tits tree for a $p$-adic number field. This
field depends on the number of children of a vertex and is a finite extension
of the field of $p$-adic numbers. It is shown that fixing $p$-adic
representatives of the residue field allows a natural way of encoding strings
by identifying a given alphabet with such representatives. A simple $p$-adic
hierarchic classification algorithm is derived for $p$-adic numbers, and is
applied to strings over finite alphabets. Examples of DNA coding are presented
and discussed. Finally, new geometric and combinatorial invariants of time
series of $p$-adic dendrograms are developped."
"We analyze the service times of customers in a stable M/M/1 queue in
equilibrium depending on their position in a busy period. We give the law of
the service of a customer at the beginning, at the end, or in the middle of the
busy period. It enables as a by-product to prove that the process of instants
of beginning of services is not Poisson. We then proceed to a more precise
analysis. We consider a family of polynomial generating series associated with
Dyck paths of length 2n and we show that they provide the correlation function
of the successive services in a busy period with (n+1) customers."
"We study the following two functions: d(n,c) and $\vec{d}(n,c)$; d(n,c)
($\vec{d}(n,c)$) is the minimum number k such that every c-edge-colored
undirected (directed) graph of order n and minimum monochromatic degree
(out-degree) at least k has a properly colored cycle. Abouelaoualim et al.
(2007) stated a conjecture which implies that d(n,c)=1. Using a recursive
construction of c-edge-colored graphs with minimum monochromatic degree p and
without properly colored cycles, we show that $d(n,c)\ge {1 \over c}(\log_cn
-\log_c\log_cn)$ and, thus, the conjecture does not hold. In particular, this
inequality significantly improves a lower bound on $\vec{d}(n,2)$ obtained by
Gutin, Sudakov and Yeo in 1998."
"For a graph G, consider the pairs of edge-disjoint matchings whose union
consists of as many edges as possible. Let H be the largest matching among such
pairs. Let M be a maximum matching of G. We show that 5/4 is a tight upper
bound for |M|/|H|."
"For a graph consider the pairs of disjoint matchings which union contains as
many edges as possible, and define a parameter $\alpha$ which eqauls the
cardinality of the largest matching in those pairs. Also, define $\betta$ to be
the cardinality of a maximum matching of the graph.
  We give a constructive characterization of trees which satisfy the
$\alpha$=$\betta$ equality. The proof of our main theorem is based on a new
decomposition algorithm obtained for trees."
"The Hales numbered $n$-dimensional hypercube and the corresponding adjacency
matrix exhibit interesting recursive structures in $n$. These structures lead
to a very simple proof of the well-known bandwidth formula for hypercube, whose
proof was thought to be surprisingly difficult. A related problem called
hypercube antibandwidth, for which Harper proposed an algorithm, is also
reexamined in the light of the above recursive structures, and a close form
solution is found."
"The paper presents a course on Combinatorial Algorithms that is based on the
drafts of the author that he used while teaching the course in the Department
of Informatics and Applied Mathematics of Yerevan State University, Armenia
from February 2007 to June 2007."
"The results here presented are a continuation of the algebraic research line
which attempts to find properties of multiple-valued systems based on a poset
of two agents.
  The aim of this paper is to exhibit two relationships between some
three-valued structures and binary relations. The established connections are
so narrow that two representation theorems are obtained."
"Modular decomposition is fundamental for many important problems in
algorithmic graph theory including transitive orientation, the recognition of
several classes of graphs, and certain combinatorial optimization problems.
Accordingly, there has been a drive towards a practical, linear-time algorithm
for the problem. Despite considerable effort, such an algorithm has remained
elusive. The linear-time algorithms to date are impractical and of mainly
theoretical interest. In this paper we present the first simple, linear-time
algorithm to compute the modular decomposition tree of an undirected graph. The
breakthrough comes by combining the best elements of two different approaches
to the problem."
"In this paper we deal with the problem of axiomatizing the preference
relations modelled through Choquet integral with respect to a $k$-additive
capacity, i.e. whose M\""obius transform vanishes for subsets of more than $k$
elements. Thus, $k$-additive capacities range from probability measures ($k=1$)
to general capacities ($k=n$). The axiomatization is done in several steps,
starting from symmetric 2-additive capacities, a case related to the Gini
index, and finishing with general $k$-additive capacities. We put an emphasis
on 2-additive capacities. Our axiomatization is done in the framework of social
welfare, and complete previous results of Weymark, Gilboa and Ben Porath, and
Gajdos."
"Considering a linearly ordered set, we introduce its symmetric version, and
endow it with two operations extending supremum and infimum, so as to obtain an
algebraic structure close to a commutative ring. We show that imposing symmetry
necessarily entails non associativity, hence computing rules are defined in
order to deal with non associativity. We study in details computing rules,
which we endow with a partial order. This permits to find solutions to the
inversion formula underlying the M\""obius transform. Then we apply these
results to the case of capacities, a notion from decision theory which
corresponds, in the language of ordered sets, to order preserving mappings,
preserving also top and bottom. In this case, the solution of the inversion
formula is called the M\""obius transform of the capacity. Properties and
examples of M\""obius transform of sup-preserving and inf-preserving capacities
are given."
"We consider the problem of minimizing the size of a family of sets G such
that every subset of 1,...,n can be written as a disjoint union of at most k
members of G, where k and n are given numbers. This problem originates in a
real-world application aiming at the diversity of industrial production. At the
same time, the minimum of G so that every subset of 1,...,n is the union of two
sets in G has been asked by Erdos and studied recently by Furedi and Katona
without requiring the disjointness of the sets. A simple construction providing
a feasible solution is conjectured to be optimal for this problem for all
values of n and k and regardless of the disjointness requirement; we prove this
conjecture in special cases including all (n,k) for which n <= 3k holds, and
some individual values of n and k."
"In an undirected connected graph G=(V,E), the vertex separator problem (VSP)
asks for a partition of V into nonempty subsets A, B, C such that |C| is
minimized such that there is no edge between A and B, and sizes of A and B are
similar. This paper presents a polyhedral approach of the (VSP), introducing
new efficient valid inequalities and providing computational tests and results."
"For integers m,k >= 1, we investigate the maximum size of a directed cut in
directed graphs in which there are m edges and each vertex has either indegree
at most k or outdegree at most k."
"The b-chromatic number of a graph G is the largest integer k such that G has
a coloring of the vertices in k color classes such that every color class
contains a vertex that has a neighbour in all other color classes. We
characterize the class of chordal graphs for which the b-chromatic number is
equal to the chromatic number for every induced subgraph."
"An interval edge t-coloring of a graph G is a proper edge coloring of G with
colors 1,2...,t such that at least one edge of G is colored by color
i,i=1,2...,t, and the edges incident with each vertex x are colored by d_{G}(x)
consecutive colors, where d_{G}(x) is the degree of the vertex x in G. For
Mobius ladders the existence of this coloring is proved and all possible
numbers of colors in such colorings are found."
"This book objective is to develop an algebraization of graph grammars.
Equivalently, we study graph dynamics. From the point of view of a computer
scientist, graph grammars are a natural generalization of Chomsky grammars for
which a purely algebraic approach does not exist up to now. A Chomsky (or
string) grammar is, roughly speaking, a precise description of a formal
language (which in essence is a set of strings). On a more discrete
mathematical style, it can be said that graph grammars -- Matrix Graph Grammars
in particular -- study dynamics of graphs. Ideally, this algebraization would
enforce our understanding of grammars in general, providing new analysis
techniques and generalizations of concepts, problems and results known so far."
"Network flow interdiction analysis studies by how much the value of a maximum
flow in a network can be diminished by removing components of the network
constrained to some budget. Although this problem is strongly NP-complete on
general networks, pseudo-polynomial algorithms were found for planar networks
with a single source and a single sink and without the possibility to remove
vertices. In this work we introduce pseudo-polynomial algorithms which overcome
some of the restrictions of previous methods. We propose a planarity-preserving
transformation that allows to incorporate vertex removals and vertex capacities
in pseudo-polynomial interdiction algorithms for planar graphs. Additionally, a
pseudo-polynomial algorithm is introduced for the problem of determining the
minimal interdiction budget which is at least needed to make it impossible to
satisfy the demand of all sink nodes, on planar networks with multiple sources
and sinks satisfying that the sum of the supplies at the source nodes equals
the sum of the demands at the sink nodes. Furthermore we show that the
k-densest subgraph problem on planar graphs can be reduced to a network flow
interdiction problem on a planar graph with multiple sources and sinks and
polynomially bounded input numbers. However it is still not known if either of
these problems can be solved in polynomial time."
"We introduce a new functional element (synchronizer for marked pairs) meant
to join results of parallel processing in two-branch fork-join queueing
network. Approximations for distribution of sojourn time at the synchronizer
are derived along with a validity domain. Calculations are performed assuming
that: arrivals to the network form a Poisson process, each branch operates like
an M/M/N queueing system. It is shown that mean sojourn time at a real
synchronizer node is bounded below by the value, defined by parameters of the
network (which contains the synchronizer) and does not depend upon performance
and particular properties of the synchronizer."
"We introduce a model for synchronizer of marked pairs, which is a node for
joining results of parallel processing in two-branch fork-join queueing
network. A distribution for number of jobs in the synchronizer is obtained.
Calculations are performed assuming that: arrivals to the network form a
Poisson process, each branch operates like an M/M/N queueing system. It is
shown that a mean quantity of jobs in the synchronizer is bounded below by the
value, defined by parameters of the network (which contains the synchronizer)
and does not depend upon performance and particular properties of the
synchronizer. A domain of network parameters is found, where the flow of jobs
departing from the synchronizer does not manifest a statistically significant
difference from the Poisson type, despite the correlation between job flows
from both branches of the fork-join network."
"In general the problem of finding a miminum spanning tree for a weighted
directed graph is difficult but solvable. There are a lot of differences
between problems for directed and undirected graphs, therefore the algorithms
for undirected graphs cannot usually be applied to the directed case. In this
paper we examine the kind of weights such that the problems are equivalent and
a minimum spanning tree of a directed graph may be found by a simple algorithm
for an undirected graph."
"A coloring of edges of a finite directed graph turns the graph into
finite-state automaton. The synchronizing word of a deterministic automaton is
a word in the alphabet of colors (considered as letters) of its edges that maps
the automaton to a single state. A coloring of edges of a directed graph of
uniform outdegree (constant outdegree of any vertex) is synchronizing if the
coloring turns the graph into a deterministic finite automaton possessing a
synchronizing word. The road coloring problem is the problem of synchronizing
coloring of a directed finite strongly connected graph of uniform outdegree if
the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its cycles is one. The
problem posed in 1970 had evoked a noticeable interest among the specialists in
the theory of graphs, automata, codes, symbolic dynamics as well as among the
wide mathematical community. A polynomial time algorithm of $O(n^3)$ complexity
in the most worst case and quadratic in majority of studied cases for the road
coloring of the considered graph is presented below. The work is based on
recent positive solution of the road coloring problem. The algorithm was
implemented in the package TESTAS"
"Some 25 years ago Valiant introduced an algebraic model of computation in
order to study the complexity of evaluating families of polynomials. The theory
was introduced along with the complexity classes VP and VNP which are analogues
of the classical classes P and NP. Families of polynomials that are difficult
to evaluate (that is, VNP-complete) includes the permanent and hamiltonian
polynomials. In a previous paper the authors together with P. Koiran studied
the expressive power of permanent and hamiltonian polynomials of matrices of
bounded treewidth, as well as the expressive power of perfect matchings of
planar graphs. It was established that the permanent and hamiltonian
polynomials of matrices of bounded treewidth are equivalent to arithmetic
formulas. Also, the sum of weights of perfect matchings of planar graphs was
shown to be equivalent to (weakly) skew circuits. In this paper we continue the
research in the direction described above, and study the expressive power of
permanents, hamiltonians and perfect matchings of matrices that have bounded
pathwidth or bounded cliquewidth. In particular, we prove that permanents,
hamiltonians and perfect matchings of matrices that have bounded pathwidth
express exactly arithmetic formulas. This is an improvement of our previous
result for matrices of bounded treewidth. Also, for matrices of bounded
weighted cliquewidth we show membership in VP for these polynomials."
"We show that if G is a connected bridgeless cubic graph whose every 2-factor
is comprised of cycles of length five then G is the Petersen graph."
"Theory of splicing is an abstract model of the recombinant behaviour of DNAs.
In a splicing system, two strings to be spliced are taken from the same set and
the splicing rule is from another set. Here we propose a generalised splicing
(GS) model with three components, two strings from two languages and a splicing
rule from third component. We propose a generalised self assembly (GSA) of
strings. Two strings $u_1xv_1$ and $u_2xv_2$ self assemble over $x$ and
generate $u_1xv_2$ and $u_2xv_1$. We study the relationship between GS and GSA.
We study some classes of generalised splicing languages with the help of
generalised self assembly."
"Let PCP(k) denote the Post Correspondence Problem for k input pairs of
strings. Let ACCESSIBILITY(k) denote the the word problem for k-rule semi-Thue
systems. In 1980, Claus showed that if ACCESSIBILITY(k) is undecidable then
PCP(k + 4) is also undecidable. The aim of the paper is to present a clean,
detailed proof of the statement.
  We proceed in two steps, using the Generalized Post Correspondence Problem as
an auxiliary. First, we prove that if ACCESSIBILITY(k) is undecidable then
GPCP(k + 2) is also undecidable. Then, we prove that if GPCP(k) is undecidable
then PCP(k + 2) is also undecidable. (The latter result has also been shown by
Harju and Karhumaki.) To date, the sharpest undecidability bounds for both PCP
and GPCP have been deduced from Claus's result: since Matiyasevich and
Senizergues showed that ACCESSIBILITY(3) is undecidable, GPCP(5) and PCP(7) are
undecidable."
"Given a directed graph $D=(V,A)$ with a set of $d$ specified vertices
$S=\{s_1,...,s_d\}\subseteq V$ and a function $f\colon S \to \mathbb{Z}_+$
where $\mathbb{Z}_+$ denotes the set of non-negative integers, we consider the
problem which asks whether there exist $\sum_{i=1}^d f(s_i)$ in-trees denoted
by $T_{i,1},T_{i,2},..., T_{i,f(s_i)}$ for every $i=1,...,d$ such that
$T_{i,1},...,T_{i,f(s_i)}$ are rooted at $s_i$, each $T_{i,j}$ spans vertices
from which $s_i$ is reachable and the union of all arc sets of $T_{i,j}$ for
$i=1,...,d$ and $j=1,...,f(s_i)$ covers $A$. In this paper, we prove that such
set of in-trees covering $A$ can be found by using an algorithm for the
weighted matroid intersection problem in time bounded by a polynomial in
$\sum_{i=1}^df(s_i)$ and the size of $D$. Furthermore, for the case where $D$
is acyclic, we present another characterization of the existence of in-trees
covering $A$, and then we prove that in-trees covering $A$ can be computed more
efficiently than the general case by finding maximum matchings in a series of
bipartite graphs."
"The Fibonacci index of a graph is the number of its stable sets. This
parameter is widely studied and has applications in chemical graph theory. In
this paper, we establish tight upper bounds for the Fibonacci index in terms of
the stability number and the order of general graphs and connected graphs.
Tur\'an graphs frequently appear in extremal graph theory. We show that Tur\'an
graphs and a connected variant of them are also extremal for these particular
problems."
"For $i=2,3$ and a cubic graph $G$ let $\nu_{i}(G)$ denote the maximum number
of edges that can be covered by $i$ matchings. We show that $\nu_{2}(G)\geq
{4/5}| V(G)| $ and $\nu_{3}(G)\geq {7/6}| V(G)| $. Moreover, it turns out that
$\nu_{2}(G)\leq \frac{|V(G)|+2\nu_{3}(G)}{4}$."
"Hypergraphs are structures that can be decomposed or described; in other
words they are recursively countable. Here, we get exact and asymptotic
enumeration results on hypergraphs by means of exponential generating
functions. The number of hypergraph component is bounded, as a generalisation
of Wright inequalities for graphs: the proof is a combinatorial understanding
of the structure by inclusion exclusion. Asymptotic results are obtained,
thanks to generating functions proofs are at the end very easy to read, through
complex analysis by saddle point method. By this way, we characterized:
  - the components with a given number of vertices and of hyperedges by the
expected size of a random hypermatching in these structures.
  - the random hypergraphs (evolving hyperedge by hyperedge) according to the
expected number of hyperedges when the first cycle appears in the evolving
structure.
  This work is an open road to further works on random hypergraphs such as
threshold phenomenon, tools used here seem to be sufficient at first sight."
"A graph is a path graph if it is the intersection graph of a family of
subpaths of a tree. In 1970, Renz asked for a characterizaton of path graphs by
forbidden induced subgraphs. Here we answer this question by listing all graphs
that are not path graphs and are minimal with this property."
"The key step of generating the well-known Hsiao code is to construct a
{0,1}-check-matrix in which each column contains the same odd-number of 1's and
each row contains the same number of 1's or differs at most by one for the
number of 1's. We also require that no two columns are identical in the matrix.
The author solved this problem in 1986 by introducing a type of recursively
balanced matrices. However, since the paper was published in Chinese, the
solution for such an important problem was not known by international
researchers in coding theory. In this note, we focus on how to practically
generate the check matrix of Hsiao codes. We have modified the original
algorithm to be more efficient and effective. We have also corrected an error
in algorithm analysis presented in the earlier paper. The result shows that the
algorithm attained optimum in average cases if a divide-and-conquer technique
must be involved in the algorithm."
"We extend the notion of $P_4$-sparse graphs previously introduced by
{\scshape Ho\`ang} by considering $\mathcal{F}$-sparse graphs were
$\mathcal{F}$ denotes a finite set of graphs on $p$ vertices. Thus we obtain
some results on $(P_5,\bar{P_5})$-sparse graphs already known on
$(P_5,\bar{P_5})$-free graphs. Finally we completely describe the structure of
$(P_5,\bar{P_5}, bull$)-sparse graphs, it follows that those graphs have
bounded clique-width."
"A unit cube in $k$ dimensions ($k$-cube) is defined as the the Cartesian
product $R_1\times R_2\times...\times R_k$ where $R_i$(for $1\leq i\leq k$) is
a closed interval of the form $[a_i,a_i+1]$ on the real line. A graph $G$ on
$n$ nodes is said to be representable as the intersection of $k$-cubes (cube
representation in $k$ dimensions) if each vertex of $G$ can be mapped to a
$k$-cube such that two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their
corresponding $k$-cubes have a non-empty intersection. The \emph{cubicity} of
$G$ denoted as $\cubi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ can be represented
as the intersection of $k$-cubes.
  We give an $O(bw\cdot n)$ algorithm to compute the cube representation of a
general graph $G$ in $bw+1$ dimensions given a bandwidth ordering of the
vertices of $G$, where $bw$ is the \emph{bandwidth} of $G$. As a consequence,
we get $O(\Delta)$ upper bounds on the cubicity of many well-known graph
classes such as AT-free graphs, circular-arc graphs and co-comparability graphs
which have $O(\Delta)$ bandwidth. Thus we have: 1) $\cubi(G)\leq 3\Delta-1$, if
$G$ is an AT-free graph. 2) $\cubi(G)\leq 2\Delta+1$, if $G$ is a circular-arc
graph. 3) $\cubi(G)\leq 2\Delta$, if $G$ is a co-comparability graph. Also for
these graph classes, there are constant factor approximation algorithms for
bandwidth computation that generate orderings of vertices with $O(\Delta)$
width. We can thus generate the cube representation of such graphs in
$O(\Delta)$ dimensions in polynomial time."
"We describe the algorithms used by the ALEKS computer learning system for
manipulating combinatorial descriptions of human learners' states of knowledge,
generating all states that are possible according to a description of a
learning space in terms of a partial order, and using Bayesian statistics to
determine the most likely state of a student. As we describe, a representation
of a knowledge space using learning sequences (basic words of an antimatroid)
allows more general learning spaces to be implemented with similar algorithmic
complexity. We show how to define a learning space from a set of learning
sequences, find a set of learning sequences that concisely represents a given
learning space, generate all states of a learning space represented in this
way, and integrate this state generation procedure into a knowledge assessment
algorithm. We also describe some related theoretical results concerning
projections of learning spaces, decomposition and dimension of learning spaces,
and algebraic representation of learning spaces."
"We continue the study of the assignment problem for a random cost matrix. We
analyse the number of $k$-cycles for the solution and their dependence on the
symmetry of the random matrix. We observe that for a symmetric matrix one and
two-cycles are dominant in the optimal solution. In the antisymmetric case the
situation is the opposite and the one and two-cycles are suppressed. We solve
the model for a pure random matrix (without correlations between its entries)
and give analytic arguments to explain the numerical results in the symmetric
and antisymmetric case. We show that the results can be explained to great
accuracy by a simple ansatz that connects the expected number of $k$-cycles to
that of one and two cycles."
"Warnsdorffs rule for a knights tour is a heuristic, i.e., it is a rule that
does not produce the desired result all the time. It is a classic example of a
greedy method in that it is based on a series of locally optimal choices. This
note describes an analysis that determines how good the heuristic is on an 8 X
8 chessboard. The order of appearance in a permutation of the eight possible
moves a knight can make determines the path the knight takes. A computer
analysis is done of the 8! permutations of the order of a knights moves in
Warnsdorffs rule on an 8 X 8 chessboard for tours starting on each of the 64
squares. Whenever a tie occurs for moves to vertices that have the lowest
degree, the first of these vertices encountered in the programming loop is
chosen. The number of permutations of the 8! total that yield non-Hamiltonian
paths is tallied. This will be the same value if we consistently choose the
last of these vertices encountered."
"In this paper, we present a new linear programming (LP) formulation of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The proposed model has O(n^8) variables and
O(n^7) constraints, where n is the number of cities. Our numerical
experimentation shows that computational times for the proposed linear program
are several orders of magnitude smaller than those for the existing model [3]."
"We prove that it is NP-complete, given a graph G and a parameter h, to
determine whether G contains a complete graph K_h as a minor."
"The sun is the graph obtained from a cycle of length even and at least six by
adding edges to make the even-indexed vertices pairwise adjacent. Suns play an
important role in the study of strongly chordal graphs. A graph is chordal if
it does not contain an induced cycle of length at least four. A graph is
strongly chordal if it is chordal and every even cycle has a chord joining
vertices whose distance on the cycle is odd. Farber proved that a graph is
strongly chordal if and only if it is chordal and contains no induced suns.
There are well known polynomial-time algorithms for recognizing a sun in a
chordal graph. Recently, polynomial-time algorithms for finding a sun for a
larger class of graphs, the so-called HHD-free graphs, have been discovered. In
this paper, we prove the problem of deciding whether an arbitrary graph
contains a sun in NP-complete."
"We prove that the Parikh map of a bounded context-free language is a box
spline. Moreover we prove that in this case, such a function is rational."
"We call a CNF formula linear if any two clauses have at most one variable in
common. Let m(k) be the largest integer m such that any linear k-CNF formula
with <= m clauses is satisfiable. We show that 4^k / (4e^2k^3) <= m(k) < ln(2)
k^4 4^k. More generally, a (k,d)-CSP is a constraint satisfaction problem in
conjunctive normal form where each variable can take on one of d values, and
each constraint contains k variables and forbids exacty one of the d^k possible
assignments to these variables. Call a (k,d)-CSP l-disjoint if no two distinct
constraints have l or more variables in common. Let m_l(k,d) denote the largest
integer m such that any l-disjoint (k,d)-CSP with at most m constraints is
satisfiable. We show that 1/k (d^k/(ed^(l-1)k))^(1+1/(l-1))<= m_l(k,d) < c
(k^2/l ln(d) d^k)^(1+1/(l-1)). for some constant c. This means for constant l,
upper and lower bound differ only in a polynomial factor in d and k."
"We show that a randomly chosen 3-CNF formula over n variables with
clauses-to-variables ratio at least 4.4898 is, as n grows large, asymptotically
almost surely unsatisfiable. The previous best such bound, due to Dubois in
1999, was 4.506. The first such bound, independently discovered by many groups
of researchers since 1983, was 5.19. Several decreasing values between 5.19 and
4.506 were published in the years between. The probabilistic techniques we use
for the proof are, we believe, of independent interest."
"A representation of finite fields that has proved useful when implementing
finite field arithmetic in hardware is based on an isomorphism between subrings
and fields. In this paper, we present an unified formulation for multiplication
in cyclotomic rings and cyclotomic fields in that most arithmetic operations
are done on vectors. From this formulation we can generate optimized algorithms
for multiplication. For example, one of the proposed algorithms requires
approximately half the number of coordinate-level multiplications at the
expense of extra coordinate-level additions. Our method is then applied to the
finite fields GF(q^m) to further reduce the number of operations. We then
present optimized algorithms for multiplication in finite fields with type-I
and type-II optimal normal bases."
"Generation of pseudo random sequences by cellular automata, as well as by
hybrid cellular automata is surveyed. An application to the fast evaluation and
FPGA implementation of some classes of boolean functions is sketched out."
"We consider the Cartesian product X of n finite intervals of integers and a
map F from X to itself. As main result, we establish an upper bound on the
number of fixed points for F which only depends on X and on the topology of the
positive circuits of the interaction graph associated with F. The proof uses
and strongly generalizes a theorem of Richard and Comet which corresponds to a
discrete version of the Thomas' conjecture: if the interaction graph associated
with F has no positive circuit, then F has at most one fixed point. The
obtained upper bound on the number of fixed points also strongly generalizes
the one established by Aracena et al for a particular class of Boolean
networks."
"A number-conserving cellular automaton is a cellular automaton whose states
are integers and whose transition function keeps the sum of all cells constant
throughout its evolution. It can be seen as a kind of modelization of the
physical conservation laws of mass or energy. In this paper, we first propose a
necessary condition for triangular and hexagonal cellular automata to be
number-conserving. The local transition function is expressed by the sum of
arity two functions which can be regarded as 'flows' of numbers. The
sufficiency is obtained through general results on number-conserving cellular
automata. Then, using the previous flow functions, we can construct effective
number-conserving simulations between hexagonal cellular automata and
triangular cellular automata."
"Erd\""os conjectured that if $G$ is a triangle free graph of chromatic number
at least $k\geq 3$, then it contains an odd cycle of length at least
$k^{2-o(1)}$ \cite{sudakovverstraete, verstraete}. Nothing better than a linear
bound (\cite{gyarfas}, Problem 5.1.55 in \cite{West}) was so far known. We make
progress on this conjecture by showing that $G$ contains an odd cycle of length
at least $O(k\log\log k)$. Erd\""os' conjecture is known to hold for graphs with
girth at least 5. We show that if a girth 4 graph is $C_5$ free, then Erd\""os'
conjecture holds. When the number of vertices is not too large we can prove
better bounds on $\chi$. We also give bounds on the chromatic number of graphs
with at most $r$ cycles of length $1\bmod k$, or at most $s$ cycles of length
$2\bmod k$, or no cycles of length $3\bmod k$. Our techniques essentially
consist of using a depth first search tree to decompose the graph into ordered
paths, which are then fed to an online coloring algorithm. Using this technique
we give simple proofs of some old results, and also obtain several simpler
results. We also obtain a lower bound on the number of colors an online
coloring algorithm needs to use on triangle free graphs."
"Cellular Automata (CA), as they are presented in the literature, are abstract
mathematical models of computation. In this pa- per we present an alternate
approach: using the CA as a model or theory of physical systems and devices.
While this approach abstracts away all details of the underlying physical
system, it remains faithful to the fact that there is an underlying physical
reality which it describes. This imposes certain restrictions on the types of
computations a CA can physically carry out, and the resources it needs to do
so. In this paper we explore these and other consequences of our
reformalization."
"Sturmian words are infinite binary words with many equivalent definitions:
They have a minimal factor complexity among all aperiodic sequences; they are
balanced sequences (the labels 0 and 1 are as evenly distributed as possible)
and they can be constructed using a mechanical definition. All this properties
make them good candidates for being extremal points in scheduling problems over
two processors. In this paper, we consider the problem of generalizing Sturmian
words to trees. The problem is to evenly distribute labels 0 and 1 over
infinite trees. We show that (strongly) balanced trees exist and can also be
constructed using a mechanical process as long as the tree is irrational. Such
trees also have a minimal factor complexity. Therefore they bring the hope that
extremal scheduling properties of Sturmian words can be extended to such trees,
as least partially. Such possible extensions are illustrated by one such
example."
"The Hamiltonian cycle problem is to decide whether a given graph has a
Hamiltonian cycle. Bertossi and Bonuccelli (1986, Information Processing
Letters, 23, 195-200) proved that the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is NP-Complete
even for undirected path graphs and left the Hamiltonian cycle problem open for
directed path graphs. Narasimhan (1989, Information Processing Letters, 32,
167-170) proved that the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is NP-Complete even for
directed path graphs and left the Hamiltonian cycle problem open for rooted
directed path graphs. In this paper we resolve this open problem by proving
that the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is also NP-Complete for rooted directed path
graphs."
"The paper considers the problem of finding the largest possible set P(n), a
subset of the set N of the natural numbers, with the property that a number is
in P(n) if and only if it is a sum of n distinct naturals all in P(n) or none
in P(n). Here largest is in the set theoretic sense and n is greater than or
equal to 2. We call P(n) a maximal set obeying this property. For small n say 2
or 3, it is possible to develop P(n) intuitively but we strongly felt the
necessity of an algorithm for any n greater than or equal to 2. Now P(n) shall
invariably be a infinite set so we define another set Q(n) such that
Q(n)=N-P(n), prove that Q(n) is finite and, since P(n) is automatically known
if Q(n) is known, design an algorithm of worst case O(1) complexity which
generates Q(n)."
"In this paper, we study fractional multiflows in undirected graphs. A
fractional multiflow in a graph G with a node subset T, called terminals, is a
collection of weighted paths with ends in T such that the total weights of
paths traversing each edge does not exceed 1. Well-known fractional path
packing problem consists of maximizing the total weight of paths with ends in a
subset S of TxT over all fractional multiflows. Together, G,T and S form a
network. A network is an Eulerian network if all nodes in N\T have even
degrees.
  A term ""fractionality"" was defined for the fractional path packing problem by
A. Karzanov as the smallest natural number D so that there exists a solution to
the problem that becomes integer-valued when multiplied by D. A. Karzanov has
defined the class of Eulerian networks in terms of T and S, outside which D is
infinite and proved that whithin this class D can be 1,2 or 4. He conjectured
that D should be 1 or 2 for this class of networks. In this paper we prove this
conjecture."
"In a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ let $\gamma$ denote the largest
fraction of edges that can be $\Delta$ edge-coloured. Albertson and Haas showed
that $\gamma \geq 13/15$ when $G$ is cubic . We show here that this result can
be extended to graphs with maximum degree 3 with the exception of a graph on 5
vertices. Moreover, there are exactly two graphs with maximum degree 3 (one
being obviously the Petersen graph) for which $\gamma = 13/15$. This extends a
result given by Steffen. These results are obtained by using structural
properties of the so called $\delta$-minimum edge colourings for graphs with
maximum degree 3. Keywords : Cubic graph; Edge-colouring"
"A conjecture of Fan and Raspaud [3] asserts that every bridgeless cubic graph
con-tains three perfect matchings with empty intersection. Kaiser and Raspaud
[6] sug-gested a possible approach to this problem based on the concept of a
balanced join in an embedded graph. We give here some new results concerning
this conjecture and prove that a minimum counterexample must have at least 32
vertices."
"A normal partition of the edges of a cubic graph is a partition into trails
(no repeated edge) such that each vertex is the end vertex of exactly one trail
of the partition. We investigate this notion and give some results and
problems."
"A conjecture of M\'a\u{c}ajov\'a and \u{S}koviera asserts that every
bridgeless cubic graph has two perfect matchings whose intersection does not
contain any odd edge cut. We prove this conjecture for graphs with few vertices
and we give a stronger result for traceable graphs."
"{\it A unit cube in $k$-dimension (or a $k$-cube) is defined as the cartesian
product $R_1 \times R_2 \times ... \times R_k$, where each $R_i$ is a closed
interval on the real line of the form $[a_i, a_i+1]$. The {\it cubicity} of
$G$, denoted as $cub(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is the intersection
graph of a collection of $k$-cubes. Many NP-complete graph problems can be
solved efficiently or have good approximation ratios in graphs of low cubicity.
In most of these cases the first step is to get a low dimensional cube
representation of the given graph.
  It is known that for a graph $G$, $cub(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor$.
Recently it has been shown that for a graph $G$, $cub(G) \leq 4(\Delta + 1)\ln
n$, where $n$ and $\Delta$ are the number of vertices and maximum degree of
$G$, respectively. In this paper, we show that for a bipartite graph $G = (A
\cup B, E)$ with $|A| = n_1$, $|B| = n_2$, $n_1 \leq n_2$, and $\Delta' =
\min\{\Delta_A, \Delta_B\}$, where $\Delta_A = {max}_{a \in A}d(a)$ and
$\Delta_B = {max}_{b \in B}d(b)$, $d(a)$ and $d(b)$ being the degree of $a$ and
$b$ in $G$ respectively, $cub(G) \leq 2(\Delta'+2) \lceil \ln n_2 \rceil$. We
also give an efficient randomized algorithm to construct the cube
representation of $G$ in $3(\Delta'+2)\lceil \ln n_2 \rceil$ dimensions. The
reader may note that in general $\Delta'$ can be much smaller than $\Delta$.}"
"In this paper, the polynomials $P_a(x)=x^{2^l+1}+x+a$ with
$a\in\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ are studied. New criteria for the number of zeros of
$P_a(x)$ in $\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ are proved. In particular, a criterion for
$P_a(x)$ to have exactly one zero in $\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ when $\gcd(l,k)=1$ is
formulated in terms of the values of permutation polynomials introduced by
Dobbertin. We also study the affine polynomial $a^{2^l}x^{2^{2l}}+x^{2^l}+ax+1$
which is closely related to $P_a(x)$. In many cases, explicit expressions for
calculating zeros of these polynomials are provided."
"We consider a boolean network whose interaction graph has no circuit of
length >1. Under this hypothesis, we establish an upper bound on the length of
the attractors of the network which only depends on its interaction graph."
"The Fibonacci index of a graph is the number of its stable sets. This
parameter is widely studied and has applications in chemical graph theory. In
this paper, we establish tight upper bounds for the Fibonacci index in terms of
the stability number and the order of general graphs and connected graphs.
Tur\'an graphs frequently appear in extremal graph theory. We show that Tur\'an
graphs and a connected variant of them are also extremal for these particular
problems. We also make a polyhedral study by establishing all the optimal
linear inequalities for the stability number and the Fibonacci index, inside
the classes of general and connected graphs of order $n$."
"This note explores the relation between the boxicity of undirected graphs and
the Ferrers dimension of digraphs."
"In this paper we obtain several characterizations of the adjacency matrix of
a probe interval graph. In course of this study we describe an easy method of
obtaining interval representation of an interval bipartite graph from its
adjacency matrix. Finally, we note that if we add a loop at every probe vertex
of a probe interval graph, then the Ferrers dimension of the corresponding
symmetric bipartite graph is at most 3."
"We extend the notion of belief function to the case where the underlying
structure is no more the Boolean lattice of subsets of some universal set, but
any lattice, which we will endow with a minimal set of properties according to
our needs. We show that all classical constructions and definitions (e.g., mass
allocation, commonality function, plausibility functions, necessity measures
with nested focal elements, possibility distributions, Dempster rule of
combination, decomposition w.r.t. simple support functions, etc.) remain valid
in this general setting. Moreover, our proof of decomposition of belief
functions into simple support functions is much simpler and general than the
original one by Shafer."
"We are given a stack of pancakes of different sizes and the only allowed
operation is to take several pancakes from top and flip them. The unburnt
version requires the pancakes to be sorted by their sizes at the end, while in
the burnt version they additionally need to be oriented burnt-side down. We
present an algorithm with the average number of flips, needed to sort a stack
of n burnt pancakes, equal to 7n/4+O(1) and a randomized algorithm for the
unburnt version with at most 17n/12+O(1) flips on average.
  In addition, we show that in the burnt version, the average number of flips
of any algorithm is at least n+\Omega(n/log n) and conjecture that some
algorithm can reach n+\Theta(n/log n).
  We also slightly increase the lower bound on g(n), the minimum number of
flips needed to sort the worst stack of n burnt pancakes. This bound, together
with the upper bound found by Heydari and Sudborough in 1997, gives the exact
number of flips to sort the previously conjectured worst stack -I_n for n=3 mod
4 and n>=15. Finally we present exact values of f(n) up to n=19 and of g(n) up
to n=17 and disprove a conjecture of Cohen and Blum by showing that the burnt
stack -I_{15} is not the worst one for n=15."
"The aim of this paper is to provide a review of structural decomposition
methods in discrete optimization and to give a unified framework in the form of
local elimination algorithms (LEA). This paper is organized as follows. Local
elimination algorithms for discrete optimization (DO) problems (DOPs) with
constraints are considered; a classification of dynamic programming
computational procedures is given. We introduce Elimination Game and
Elimination tree. Application of bucket elimination algorithm from constraint
satisfaction (CS) to solving DOPs is done. We consider different local
elimination schemes and related notions. Clustering that merges several
variables into single meta-variable defines a promising approach to solve DOPs.
This allows to create a quotient (condensed) graph and apply a local block
elimination algorithm. In order to describe a block elimination process, we
introduce Block Elimination Game. We discuss the connection of aforementioned
local elimination algorithmic schemes and a way of transforming the directed
acyclic graph (DAG) of computational LEA procedure to the tree decomposition."
"For three positive integers ai, aj, ak pairwise coprime, we present an
algorithm that find the least multiple of ai that is a positive linear
combination of aj, ak. The average running time of this algorithm is O(1).
Using this algorithm and the chinese remainder theorem leads to a direct
computation of the Frobenius number f(a1, a2, a3)."
"Graph transformation is concerned with the manipulation of graphs by means of
rules. Graph grammars have been traditionally studied using techniques from
category theory. In previous works, we introduced Matrix Graph Grammars (MGGs)
as a purely algebraic approach for the study of graph grammars and graph
dynamics, based on the representation of graphs by means of their adjacency
matrices. MGGs have been succesfully applied to problems such as applicability
of rule sequences, sequentialization and reachability, providing new analysis
techniques and generalizing and improving previous results.
  Our next objective is to generalize MGGs in order to approach computational
complexity theory and ""static"" properties of graphs out of the ""dynamics"" of
certain grammars. In the present work, we start building bridges between MGGs
and complexity by introducing what we call ""Monotone Complex Logic"", which
allows establishing a (bijective) link between MGGs and complex analysis. We
use this logic to recast the formulation and basic building blocks of MGGs as
more proper geometric and analytic concepts (scalar products, norms,
distances). MGG rules can also be interpreted - via operators - as complex
numbers. Interestingly, the subset they define can be characterized as the
Sierpinski gasket."
"In this paper, a class of combinatorial identities is proved. A method is
used which is based on the following rule: counting elements of a given set in
two ways and making equal the obtained results. This rule is known as ""counting
in two ways"". The principle of inclusion and exclusion is used for obtaining a
class of (0,1)-matrices."
"The MULTICUT IN TREES problem consists in deciding, given a tree, a set of
requests (i.e. paths in the tree) and an integer k, whether there exists a set
of k edges cutting all the requests. This problem was shown to be FPT by Guo
and Niedermeyer. They also provided an exponential kernel. They asked whether
this problem has a polynomial kernel. This question was also raised by Fellows.
We show that MULTICUT IN TREES has a polynomial kernel."
"In the present paper, we study algorithmic questions for the arc-intersection
graph of directed paths on a tree. Such graphs are known to be perfect (proved
by Monma and Wei in 1986). We present faster algorithms than all previously
known algorithms for solving the minimum coloring and the minimum clique cover
problems. They both run in $O(np)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices of
the tree and $p$ the number of paths. Another result is a polynomial algorithm
computing a kernel in the intersection graph, when its edges are oriented in a
clique-acyclic way. Indeed, such a kernel exists for any perfect graph by a
theorem of Boros and Gurvich. Such algorithms computing kernels are known only
for few classes of perfect graphs."
"Contraction of an edge merges its end points into a new vertex which is
adjacent to each neighbor of the end points of the edge. An edge in a
$k$-connected graph is {\em contractible} if its contraction does not result in
a graph of lower connectivity. We characterize contractible edges in chordal
graphs using properties of tree decompositions with respect to minimal vertex
separators."
"Traditionally a tiling is defined with a finite number of finite forbidden
patterns. We can generalize this notion considering any set of patterns.
Generalized tilings defined in this way can be studied with a dynamical point
of view, leading to the notion of subshift. In this article we establish a
correspondence between an order on subshifts based on dynamical transformations
on them and an order on languages of forbidden patterns based on computability
properties."
"In the Matrix approach to graph transformation we represent simple digraphs
and rules with Boolean matrices and vectors, and the rewriting is expressed
using Boolean operators only. In previous works, we developed analysis
techniques enabling the study of the applicability of rule sequences, their
independence, state reachability and the minimal graph able to fire a sequence.
  In the present paper we improve our framework in two ways. First, we make
explicit (in the form of a Boolean matrix) some negative implicit information
in rules. This matrix (called nihilation matrix) contains the elements that, if
present, forbid the application of the rule (i.e. potential dangling edges, or
newly added edges, which cannot be already present in the simple digraph).
Second, we introduce a novel notion of application condition, which combines
graph diagrams together with monadic second order logic. This allows for more
flexibility and expressivity than previous approaches, as well as more concise
conditions in certain cases. We demonstrate that these application conditions
can be embedded into rules (i.e. in the left hand side and the nihilation
matrix), and show that the applicability of a rule with arbitrary application
conditions is equivalent to the applicability of a sequence of plain rules
without application conditions. Therefore, the analysis of the former is
equivalent to the analysis of the latter, showing that in our framework no
additional results are needed for the study of application conditions.
Moreover, all analysis techniques of [21, 22] for the study of sequences can be
applied to application conditions."
"In this paper, we propose a new operation, Generalised Sequential Crossover
(GSCO) of words, which in some sense an abstract model of crossing over of the
chromosomes in the living organisms. We extend GSCO over language $L$
iteratively ($GSCO^*(L)$ as well as iterated GSCO over two languages
$GSCO^*(L_1,L_2)$). Our study reveals that $GSCO^*(L)$ is subclass of regular
languages for any $L$. We compare the different classes of GSCO languages with
the prominent sub-regular classes."
"This paper outlines an application of iterated version of generalised
sequential crossover of two languages (which in some sense, an abstraction of
the crossover of chromosomes in living organisms) in studying some classes of
the newly proposed generalised splicing ($GS$) over two languages. It is proved
that, for $X,Y \in \{FIN, REG, LIN, CF, CS, RE \}, \sg \in FIN$, the subclass
of generalized splicing languages namely $GS(X,Y,\sg)$, (which is a subclass of
the class $GS(X,Y,FIN)$) is always regular."
"We theoretically analyze the Cops and Robber Game for the first time in a
multidimensional grid. It is shown that for an $n$-dimensional grid, at least
$n$ cops are necessary to ensure capture of the robber. We also present a set
of cop strategies for which $n$ cops are provably sufficient to catch the
robber. Further, for two-dimensional grid, we provide an efficient cop strategy
for which the robber is caught even by a single cop under certain conditions."
"We show that any $2-$factor of a cubic graph can be extended to a maximum
$3-$edge-colorable subgraph. We also show that the sum of sizes of maximum $2-$
and $3-$edge-colorable subgraphs of a cubic graph is at least twice of its
number of vertices. Finally, for a cubic graph $G$, consider the pairs of
edge-disjoint matchings whose union consists of as many edges as possible. Let
$H$ be the largest matching among such pairs. Let $M$ be a maximum matching of
$G$. We show that 9/8 is a tight upper bound for $|M|/|H|$."
"Tilings and tiling systems are an abstract concept that arise both as a
computational model and as a dynamical system. In this paper, we characterize
the sets of periods that a tiling system can produce. We prove that up to a
slight recoding, they correspond exactly to languages in the complexity classes
$\nspace{n}$ and $\cne$."
"We consider the class of (C4, diamond)-free graphs; graphs in this class do
not contain a C4 or a diamond as an induced subgraph. We provide an efficient
recognition algorithm for this class. We count the number of maximal cliques in
a (C4, diamond)-free graph and the number of n-vertex, labeled (C4,
diamond)-free graphs. We also give an efficient algorithm for finding a largest
clique in the more general class of (house, diamond)-free graphs."
"We introduce the notion of graphic cocircuits and show that a large class of
regular matroids with graphic cocircuits belongs to the class of signed-graphic
matroids. Moreover, we provide an algorithm which determines whether a
cographic matroid with graphic cocircuits is signed-graphic or not."
"In this paper we propose a deterministic algorithm for approximately counting
the $k$-colourings of sparse random graphs $G(n,d/n)$. In particular, our
algorithm computes in polynomial time a $(1\pm n^{-\Omega(1)})$approximation of
the logarithm of the number of $k$-colourings of $G(n,d/n)$ for $k\geq
(2+\epsilon) d$ with high probability over the graph instances.
  Our algorithm is related to the algorithms of A. Bandyopadhyay et al. in SODA
'06, and A. Montanari et al. in SODA '06, i.e. it uses {\em spatial correlation
decay} to compute {\em deterministically} marginals of {\em Gibbs
distribution}. We develop a scheme whose accuracy depends on {\em
non-reconstruction} of the colourings of $G(n,d/n)$, rather than {\em
uniqueness} that are required in previous works. This leaves open the
possibility for our schema to be sufficiently accurate even for $k<d$.
  The set up for establishing correlation decay is as follows: Given
$G(n,d/n)$, we alter the graph structure in some specific region $\Lambda$ of
the graph by deleting edges between vertices of $\Lambda$. Then we show that
the effect of this change on the marginals of Gibbs distribution, diminishes as
we move away from $\Lambda$. Our approach is novel and suggests a new context
for the study of deterministic counting algorithms."
"When drawing graphs whose edges and nodes contain text or graphics, such
informa tion needs to be displayed without overlaps, either as part of the
initial layout or as a post-processing step. The core problem in removing
overlaps lies in retaining the structural information inherent in a layout,
minimizing the additional area required, and keeping edges as straight as
possible. This paper presents a unified node and edge overlap removal algorithm
that does well at solving this problem."
"We show how to construct a non-2-colorable k-uniform hypergraph with (2^(1 +
o(1)))^k edges. By the duality of hypergraphs and monotone k-CNF-formulas this
gives an unsatisfiable monotone k-CNF with (2^(1 + o(1)))^k clauses"
"This paper presents an approach for the development of a number theoretic
discrete Hilbert transform. The forward transformation has been applied by
taking the odd reciprocals that occur in the DHT matrix with respect to a power
of 2. Specifically, the expression for a 16-point transform is provided and
results of a few representative signals are provided. The inverse transform is
the inverse of the forward 16-point matrix. But at this time the inverse
transform is not identical to the forward transform and, therefore, our
proposed number theoretic transform must be taken as a provisional result."
"A tree T_uni is m-universal for the class of trees if for every tree T of
size m, T can be obtained from T_uni by successive contractions of edges. We
prove that a m-universal tree for the class of trees has at least mln(m) +
(gamma-1)m + O(1) edges where is the Euler's constant and we build such a tree
with less than mc edges for a fixed constant c = 1.984..."
"We prove the NP-completeness of the integer multiflow problem in planar
graphs, with the following restrictions: there are only two demand edges, both
lying on the infinite face of the routing graph. This was one of the open
challenges concerning disjoint paths, explicitly asked by M\""uller. It also
strengthens Schw\""arzler's recent proof of one of the open problems of
Schrijver's book, about the complexity of the edge-disjoint paths problem with
terminals on the outer boundary of a planar graph. We also give a directed
acyclic reduction. This proves that the arc-disjoint paths problem is
NP-complete in directed acyclic graphs, even with only two demand arcs."
"We study the maximal number of triangulations that a planar set of $n$ points
can have, and show that it is at most $30^n$. This new bound is achieved by a
careful optimization of the charging scheme of Sharir and Welzl (2006), which
has led to the previous best upper bound of $43^n$ for the problem.
  Moreover, this new bound is useful for bounding the number of other types of
planar (i.e., crossing-free) straight-line graphs on a given point set.
Specifically, we derive new upper bounds for the number of planar graphs
($o(239.4^n)$), spanning cycles ($O(70.21^n)$), and spanning trees ($160^n$)."
"An edge coloring of a graph $G$ with colors $1,2,\ldots ,t$ is called an
interval $t$-coloring if for each $i\in \{1,2,\ldots,t\}$ there is at least one
edge of $G$ colored by $i$, and the colors of edges incident to any vertex of
$G$ are distinct and form an interval of integers. A graph $G$ is interval
colorable, if there is an integer $t\geq 1$ for which $G$ has an interval
$t$-coloring. Let $\mathfrak{N}$ be the set of all interval colorable graphs.
In 2004 Kubale and Giaro showed that if $G,H\in \mathfrak{N}$, then the
  Cartesian product of these graphs belongs to $\mathfrak{N}$. Also, they
formulated a similar problem for the lexicographic product as an open problem.
In this paper we first show that if $G\in \mathfrak{N}$, then $G[nK_{1}]\in
\mathfrak{N}$ for any $n\in \mathbf{N}$. Furthermore, we show that if $G,H\in
\mathfrak{N}$ and $H$ is a regular graph, then strong and lexicographic
products of graphs $G,H$ belong to $\mathfrak{N}$. We also prove that tensor
and strong tensor products of graphs $G,H$ belong to $\mathfrak{N}$ if $G\in
\mathfrak{N}$ and $H$ is a regular graph."
"A $(2,1)$-total labeling of a graph $G$ is an assignment $f$ from the vertex
set $V(G)$ and the edge set $E(G)$ to the set $\{0,1,...,k\}$ of nonnegative
integers such that $|f(x)-f(y)|\ge 2$ if $x$ is a vertex and $y$ is an edge
incident to $x$, and $|f(x)-f(y)|\ge 1$ if $x$ and $y$ are a pair of adjacent
vertices or a pair of adjacent edges, for all $x$ and $y$ in $V(G)\cup E(G)$.
The $(2,1)$-total labeling number $\lambda^T_2(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as
the minimum $k$ among all possible assignments. In [D. Chen and W. Wang.
(2,1)-Total labelling of outerplanar graphs. Discr. Appl. Math. 155, 2585--2593
(2007)], Chen and Wang conjectured that all outerplanar graphs $G$ satisfy
  $\lambda^T_2(G) \leq \Delta(G)+2$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of
$G$, while they also showed that it is true for $G$ with $\Delta(G)\geq 5$. In
this paper, we solve their conjecture completely, by proving that
  $\lambda^T_2(G) \leq \Delta(G)+2$ even in the case of $\Delta(G)\leq 4 $."
"Given an $n$-vertex planar directed graph with real edge lengths and with no
negative cycles, we show how to compute single-source shortest path distances
in the graph in $O(n\log^2n/\log\log n)$ time with O(n) space. This is an
improvement of a recent time bound of $O(n\log^2n)$ by Klein et al."
"An edge coloring of a graph $G$ with colors $1,2,..., t$ is called an
interval $t$-coloring if for each $i\in \{1,2,...,t\}$ there is at least one
edge of $G$ colored by $i$, the colors of edges incident to any vertex of $G$
are distinct and form an interval of integers. In 1994 Asratian and Kamalian
proved that if a connected graph $G$ admits an interval $t$-coloring, then
$t\leq (d+1) (\Delta -1) +1$, and if $G$ is also bipartite, then this upper
bound can be improved to $t\leq d(\Delta -1) +1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum
degree in $G$ and $d$ is the diameter of $G$. In this paper we show that these
upper bounds can not be significantly improved."
"Two-state spin systems is a classical topic in statistical physics. We
consider the problem of computing the partition function of the systems on a
bounded degree graph. Based on the self-avoiding tree, we prove the systems
exhibits strong correlation decay under the condition that the absolute value
of ""inverse temperature"" is small. Due to strong correlation decay property, an
FPTAS for the partition function is presented under the same condition. This
condition is sharp for Ising model."
"A minimum cycle basis of a weighted undirected graph $G$ is a basis of the
cycle space of $G$ such that the total weight of the cycles in this basis is
minimized. If $G$ is a planar graph with non-negative edge weights, such a
basis can be found in $O(n^2)$ time and space, where $n$ is the size of $G$. We
show that this is optimal if an explicit representation of the basis is
required. We then present an $O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ time and $O(n^{3/2})$ space
algorithm that computes a minimum cycle basis \emph{implicitly}. From this
result, we obtain an output-sensitive algorithm that explicitly computes a
minimum cycle basis in $O(n^{3/2}\log n + C)$ time and $O(n^{3/2} + C)$ space,
where $C$ is the total size (number of edges and vertices) of the cycles in the
basis. These bounds reduce to $O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ and $O(n^{3/2})$,
respectively, when $G$ is unweighted. We get similar results for the all-pairs
min cut problem since it is dual equivalent to the minimum cycle basis problem
for planar graphs. We also obtain $O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ time and $O(n^{3/2})$
space algorithms for finding, respectively, the weight vector and a Gomory-Hu
tree of $G$. The previous best time and space bound for these two problems was
quadratic. From our Gomory-Hu tree algorithm, we obtain the following result:
with $O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ time and $O(n^{3/2})$ space for preprocessing, the
weight of a min cut between any two given vertices of $G$ can be reported in
constant time. Previously, such an oracle required quadratic time and space for
preprocessing. The oracle can also be extended to report the actual cut in time
proportional to its size."
"The path packing problem is stated finding the maximum number of
edge-disjoint paths between predefined pairs of nodes in an undirected
multigraph. Such a multigraph together with predefined node pairs is often
called a network. While in general the path packing problem is NP-hard, there
exists a class of networks for which the hope of better solution for the path
packing problem exists. In this paper we prove a combinatorial max-min theorem
(also called a good characterization) for a wide class of such networks, thus
showing that the path packing problem for this class of networks is in co-NP."
"We consider a variation of the spectral sparsification problem where we are
required to keep a subgraph of the original graph. Formally, given a union of
two weighted graphs $G$ and $W$ and an integer $k$, we are asked to find a
$k$-edge weighted graph $W_k$ such that $G+W_k$ is a good spectral sparsifer of
$G+W$. We will refer to this problem as the subgraph (spectral) sparsification.
We present a nontrivial condition on $G$ and $W$ such that a good sparsifier
exists and give a polynomial time algorithm to find the sparsifer.
  %$O(\frac{n}{k})\log n \tilde{O}(\log \log n)$ As a significant application
of our technique, we show that for each positive integer $k$, every $n$-vertex
weighted graph has an $(n-1+k)$-edge spectral sparsifier with relative
condition number at most $\frac{n}{k} \log n \tilde{O}(\log\log n)$ where
$\tilde{O}()$ hides lower order terms. Our bound is within a factor of
$\tilde{O}(\log \log n)$ from optimal. This nearly settles a question left open
by Spielman and Teng about ultrasparsifiers, which is a key component in their
nearly linear-time algorithms for solving diagonally dominant symmetric linear
systems.
  We also present another application of our technique to spectral optimization
in which the goal is to maximize the algebraic connectivity of a graph (e.g.
turn it into an expander) with a limited number of edges."
"The notions of universality and completeness are central in the theories of
computation and computational complexity. However, proving lower bounds and
necessary conditions remains hard in most of the cases. In this article, we
introduce necessary conditions for a cellular automaton to be ""universal"",
according to a precise notion of simulation, related both to the dynamics of
cellular automata and to their computational power. This notion of simulation
relies on simple operations of space-time rescaling and it is intrinsic to the
model of cellular automata. Intrinsinc universality, the derived notion, is
stronger than Turing universality, but more uniform, and easier to define and
study. Our approach builds upon the notion of communication complexity, which
was primarily designed to study parallel programs, and thus is, as we show in
this article, particulary well suited to the study of cellular automata: it
allowed to show, by studying natural problems on the dynamics of cellular
automata, that several classes of cellular automata, as well as many natural
(elementary) examples, could not be intrinsically universal."
"In the Matrix approach to graph transformation we represent simple digraphs
and rules with Boolean matrices and vectors, and the rewriting is expressed
using Boolean operations only. In previous works, we developed analysis
techniques enabling the study of the applicability of rule sequences, their
independence, stated reachability and the minimal digraph able to fire a
sequence. In [20], graph constraints and application conditions (so-called
restrictions) have been studied in detail. In the present contribution we
tackle the problem of translating post-conditions into pre-conditions and vice
versa. Moreover, we shall see that application conditions can be moved along
productions inside a sequence (restriction delocalization). As a
practical-theoretical application we show how application conditions allow us
to perform multidigraph rewriting (as opposed to simple digraph rewriting)
using Matrix Graph Grammars"
"The paper introduces a modified version of the classical Coupon Collector's
Problem entailing exchanges and cooperation between multiple players. Results
of the development show that, within a proper Markov framework, the complexity
of the Cooperative Multiplayer Coupon Collectors' Problem can be attacked with
an eye to the modeling of resource harvesting and sharing within the context of
Next Generation Network. The cost of cooperation is computed in terms of
exchange protocol burden and found to be dependent on only ensemble parameters
such as the number of players and the number of coupons but not on the detailed
collection statistics. The benefits of cooperation are quantified in terms of
reduction of the average number of actions before collection completion."
"Choosing a uniformly sampled simple directed graph realization of a degree
sequence has many applications, in particular in social networks where
self-loops are commonly not allowed. It has been shown in the past that one can
perform a Markov chain arc-switching algorithm to sample a simple directed
graph uniformly by performing two types of switches: a 2-switch and a directed
3-cycle reorientation. This paper discusses under what circumstances a directed
3-cycle reorientation is required. In particular, the class of degree sequences
where this is required is a subclass of the directed 3-cycle anchored degree
sequences. An important implication of this result is a reduced Markov chain
algorithm that uses only 2-switches."
"The middle levels conjecture asserts that there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the
middle two levels of $2k+1$-dimensional hypercube. The conjecture is known to
be true for $k \leq 17$ [I.Shields, B.J.Shields and C.D.Savage, Disc. Math.,
309, 5271--5277 (2009)]. In this note, we verify that the conjecture is also
true for $k=18$ by constructing a Hamiltonian cycle in the middle two levels of
37-dimensional hypercube with the aid of the computer. We achieve this by
introducing a new decomposition technique and an efficient algorithm for
ordering the Narayana objects."
"Given a graph G = (V,E) and a parameter k, we consider the problem of finding
a subset U in V of size k that maximizes the number of induced edges (DkS). We
improve upon the previously best known approximation ratio for DkS, a ratio
that has not seen any progress during the last decade. Specifically, we improve
the approximation ratio from n^{0.32258} to n^{0.3159}.
  The improved ratio is obtained by studying a variant to the DkS problem in
which one considers the problem of finding a subset U in V of size at most k
that maximizes the number of induced edges.
  Finally, we study the DkS variant in which one considers the problem of
finding a subset U in V of size at least k that maximizes the number of induced
edges."
"A graph $G$ is class II, if its chromatic index is at least $\Delta+1$. Let
$H$ be a maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph of $G$. The paper proves best
possible lower bounds for $\frac{|E(H)|}{|E(G)|}$, and structural properties of
maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraphs. It is shown that every set of
vertex-disjoint cycles of a class II graph with $\Delta\geq3$ can be extended
to a maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph. Simple graphs have a maximum
$\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph such that the complement is a matching.
Furthermore, a maximum $\Delta$-edge-colorable subgraph of a simple graph is
always class I."
"We introduce a new approach to model and analyze \emph{Mobility}. It is fully
based on discrete mathematics and yields a class of mobility models, called the
\emph{Markov Trace} Model. This model can be seen as the discrete version of
the \emph{Random Trip} Model including all variants of the \emph{Random
Way-Point} Model \cite{L06}.
  We derive fundamental properties and \emph{explicit} analytical formulas for
the \emph{stationary distributions} yielded by the Markov Trace Model. Such
results can be exploited to compute formulas and properties for concrete cases
of the Markov Trace Model by just applying counting arguments.
  We apply the above general results to the discrete version of the
\emph{Manhattan Random Way-Point} over a square of bounded size.
  We get formulas for the total stationary distribution and for two important
\emph{conditional} ones: the agent spatial and destination distributions. Our
method makes the analysis of complex mobile systems a feasible task.
  As a further evidence of this important fact, we first model a complex
vehicular-mobile system over a set of crossing streets. Several concrete issues
are implemented such as parking zones, traffic lights, and variable vehicle
speeds. By using a \emph{modular} version of the Markov Trace Model, we get
explicit formulas for the stationary distributions yielded by this
vehicular-mobile model as well."
"We give a new insight into the upper bounding of the 3-SAT threshold by the
first moment method. The best criteria developed so far to select the solutions
to be counted discriminate among neighboring solutions on the basis of uniform
information about each individual free variable. What we mean by uniform
information, is information which does not depend on the solution: e.g. the
number of positive/negative occurrences of the considered variable. What is new
in our approach is that we use non uniform information about variables. Thus we
are able to make a more precise tuning, resulting in a slight improvement on
upper bounding the 3-SAT threshold for various models of formulas defined by
their distributions."
"We establish a limit formula for the median of the distance between two
leaves in a fully resolved unrooted phylogenetic tree with n leaves. More
precisely, we prove that this median is equal, in the limit, to the square root
of 4*ln(2)*n."
"We study hierarchical segmentation in the framework of edge-weighted graphs.
We define ultrametric watersheds as topological watersheds null on the minima.
We prove that there exists a bijection between the set of ultrametric
watersheds and the set of hierarchical segmentations. We end this paper by
showing how to use the proposed framework in practice in the example of
constrained connectivity; in particular it allows to compute such a hierarchy
following a classical watershed-based morphological scheme, which provides an
efficient algorithm to compute the whole hierarchy."
"A partial monoid $P$ is a set with a partial multiplication $\times$ (and
total identity $1_P$) which satisfies some associativity axiom. The partial
monoid $P$ may be embedded in a free monoid $P^*$ and the product $\star$ is
simulated by a string rewriting system on $P^*$ that consists in evaluating the
concatenation of two letters as a product in $P$, when it is defined, and a
letter $1_P$ as the empty word $\epsilon$. In this paper we study the profound
relations between confluence for such a system and associativity of the
multiplication. Moreover we develop a reduction strategy to ensure confluence
and which allows us to define a multiplication on normal forms associative up
to a given congruence of $P^*$. Finally we show that this operation is
associative if, and only if, the rewriting system under consideration is
confluent."
"A new algorithm to generate all Dyck words is presented, which is used in
ranking and unranking Dyck words. We emphasize the importance of using Dyck
words in encoding objects related to Catalan numbers. As a consequence of
formulas used in the ranking algorithm we can obtain a recursive formula for
the nth Catalan number."
"This paper deals with the complexity of strings, which play an important role
in biology (nucleotid sequences), information theory and computer science. The
d-complexity of a string is defined as the number of its distinct d-substrings
given in Definition 1. The case d=1 is studied in detail."
"We present a method which displays all palindromes of a given length from De
Bruijn words of a certain order, and also a recursive one which constructs all
palindromes of length $n+1$ from the set of palindromes of length $n$. We show
that the palindrome complexity function, which counts the number of palindromes
of each length contained in a given word, has a different shape compared with
the usual (subword) complexity function. We give upper bounds for the average
number of palindromes contained in all words of length $n$, and obtain exact
formulae for the number of palindromes of length 1 and 2 contained in all words
of length $n$."
"The subword complexity of a finite word $w$ of length $N$ is a function which
associates to each $n\le N$ the number of all distinct subwords of $w$ having
the length $n$. We define the \emph{maximal complexity} C(w) as the maximum of
the subword complexity for $n \in \{1,2,..., N \}$, and the \emph{global
maximal complexity} K(N) as the maximum of C(w) for all words $w$ of a fixed
length $N$ over a finite alphabet. By R(N) we will denote the set of the values
$i$ for which there exits a word of length $N$ having K(N) subwords of length
$i$.
  M(N) represents the number of words of length $N$ whose maximal complexity is
equal to the global maximal complexity."
"Computation of the extended gcd of two quadratic integers. The ring of
integers considered is principal but could be euclidean or not euclidean ring.
This method rely on principal ideal ring and reduction of binary quadratic
forms."
"We discuss the self-assembly system of triangular tiles instead of square
tiles, in particular right triangular tiles and equilateral triangular tiles.
We show that the triangular tile assembly system, either deterministic or
non-deterministic, has the same power to the square tile assembly system in
computation, which is Turing universal. By providing counter-examples, we show
that the triangular tile assembly system and the square tile assembly system
are not comparable in general. More precisely, there exists square tile
assembly system S such that no triangular tile assembly system is a division of
S and produces the same shape; there exists triangular tile assembly system T
such that no square tile assembly system produces the same compatible shape
with border glues. We also discuss the assembly of triangles by triangular
tiles and obtain results similar to the assembly of squares, that is to
assemble a triangular of size O(N^2), the minimal number of tiles required is
in O(log N/log log N)."
"We give a new and short proof of a theorem on k-hypertournament losing scores
due to Zhou et al. [G. Zhou, T. Yao, K. Zhang, On score sequences of
k-tournaments, European J. Comb., 21, 8 (2000) 993-1000.]"
"A coding method using binary sequences is presented for different computation
problems related to Catalan numbers. This method proves in a very easy way the
equivalence of these problems."
"We give two equivalent formulations of a conjecture [2,4] on the number of
arc-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in De Bruijn graphs."
"The packing chromatic number $\chi_\rho(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest
integer $k$ such that the vertex set $V(G)$ can be partitioned into disjoint
classes $X_1, ..., X_k$, where vertices in $X_i$ have pairwise distance greater
than $i$. For the 2-dimensional square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ it is proved that
$\chi_\rho(\mathbb{Z}^2) \geq 12$, which improves the previously known lower
bound 10."
"Let $a, b$ and $n$ be nonnegative integers $(b \geq a, \ b > 0, \ n \geq 1)$,
$\mathcal{G}_n(a,b)$ be a multigraph on $n$ vertices in which any pair of
vertices is connected with at least $a$ and at most $b$ edges and \textbf{v =}
$(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)$ be a vector containing $n$ nonnegative integers. We give
a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such orientation of
the edges of $\mathcal{G}_n(a,b)$, that the resulted out-degree vector equals
to \textbf{v}. We describe a reconstruction algorithm. In worst case checking
of \textbf{v} requires $\Theta(n)$ time and the reconstruction algorithm works
in $O(bn^3)$ time. Theorems of H. G. Landau (1953) and J. W. Moon (1963) on the
score sequences of tournaments are special cases $b = a = 1$ resp. $b = a \geq
1$ of our result."
"Finding the number 2H6 of directed Hamiltonian cycles in 6-cube is problem 43
in Section 7.2.1.1 of Knuth's ' The Art of Computer Programming'; various
proposed estimates are surveyed below. We computed exact value:
H6=14,754,666,508,334,433,250,560=6*2^4*217,199*1,085,989*5,429,923. Also the
number Aut6 of those cycles up to automorphisms of 6-cube was computed as

"We consider the Seidel complementation on ($P_5, \bar{P_5}, Bull)$-free
graphs"
"We consider cubic graphs formed with $k \geq 2$ disjoint claws $C_i \sim
K_{1, 3}$ ($0 \leq i \leq k-1$) such that for every integer $i$ modulo $k$ the
three vertices of degree 1 of $\ C_i$ are joined to the three vertices of
degree 1 of $C_{i-1}$ and joined to the three vertices of degree 1 of
$C_{i+1}$. Denote by $t_i$ the vertex of degree 3 of $C_i$ and by $T$ the set
$\{t_1, t_2,..., t_{k-1}\}$. In such a way we construct three distinct graphs,
namely $FS(1,k)$, $FS(2,k)$ and $FS(3,k)$. The graph $FS(j,k)$ ($j \in \{1, 2,
3\}$) is the graph where the set of vertices $\cup_{i=0}^{i=k-1}V(C_i)
\setminus T$ induce $j$ cycles (note that the graphs $FS(2,2p+1)$, $p\geq2$,
are the flower snarks defined by Isaacs \cite{Isa75}). We determine the number
of perfect matchings of every $FS(j,k)$. A cubic graph $G$ is said to be {\em
2-factor hamiltonian} if every 2-factor of $G$ is a hamiltonian cycle. We
characterize the graphs $FS(j,k)$ that are 2-factor hamiltonian (note that
FS(1,3) is the ""Triplex Graph"" of Robertson, Seymour and Thomas \cite{RobSey}).
A {\em strong matching} $M$ in a graph $G$ is a matching $M$ such that there is
no edge of $E(G)$ connecting any two edges of $M$. A cubic graph having a
perfect matching union of two strong matchings is said to be a {\em\Jaev}. We
characterize the graphs $FS(j,k)$ that are \Jaesv."
"An $r$-graph is an $r$-regular graph where every odd set of vertices is
connected by at least $r$ edges to the rest of the graph. Seymour conjectured
that any $r$-graph is $r+1$-edge-colorable, and also that any $r$-graph
contains $2r$ perfect matchings such that each edge belongs to two of them. We
show that the minimum counter-example to either of these conjectures is a
brick. Furthermore we disprove a variant of a conjecture of Fan, Raspaud."
"The resistance $r(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges that have
to be removed from $G$ to obtain a graph which is $\Delta(G)$-edge-colorable.
The paper relates the resistance to other parameters that measure how far is a
graph from being $\Delta$-edge-colorable. The first part considers regular
graphs and the relation of the resistance to structural properties in terms of
2-factors. The second part studies general (multi-) graphs $G$. Let $r_v(G)$ be
the minimum number of vertices that have to be removed from $G$ to obtain a
class 1 graph. We show that $\frac{r(G)}{r_v(G)} \leq \lfloor
\frac{\Delta(G)}{2} \rfloor$, and that this bound is best possible."
"Optimal (v, 4, 2, 1) optical orthogonal codes (OOC) with $v<=75$ and $v\ne
71$ are classified up to equivalence. One $(v, 4, 2, 1)$ OOC is presented for
all $v\le 181$, for which an optimal OOC exists."
"This note examines the question of randomness in a sequence based on the
continued fraction (CF) representation of its corresponding representation as a
number, or as D sequence. We propose a randomness measure that is directly
equal to the number of components of the CF representation. This provides a
means of quantifying the randomness of the popular PN sequences as well. A
comparison is made of representation as a fraction and as a continued fraction."
"In Graph Theory a number of results were devoted to studying the
computational complexity of the number modulo 2 of a graph's edge set
decompositions of various kinds, first of all including its Hamiltonian
decompositions, as well as the number modulo 2 of, say, Hamiltonian
cycles/paths etc. While the problems of finding a Hamiltonian decomposition and
Hamiltonian cycle are NP-complete, counting these objects modulo 2 in
polynomial time is yet possible for certain types of regular undirected graphs.
Some of the most known examples are the theorems about the existence of an even
number of Hamiltonian decompositions in a 4-regular graph and an even number of
such decompositions where two given edges e and g belong to different cycles
(Thomason, 1978), as well as an even number of Hamiltonian cycles passing
through any given edge in a regular odd-degreed graph (Smith's theorem). The
present article introduces a new algebraic technique which generalizes the
notion of counting modulo 2 via applying fields of Characteristic 2 and
determinants and, for instance, allows to receive a polynomial-time formula for
the number modulo 2 of a 4-regular bipartite graph's Hamiltonian decompositions
such that a given edge and a given path of length 2 belong to different
Hamiltonian cycles - hence refining/extending (in a computational sense)
Thomason's result for bipartite graphs. This technique also provides a
polynomial-time calculation of the number modulo 2 of a graph's edge set
decompositions into simple cycles each containing at least one element of a
given set of its edges what is a similar kind of extension of Thomason's
theorem as well."
"Consider a convex relaxation $\hat f$ of a pseudo-boolean function $f$. We
say that the relaxation is {\em totally half-integral} if $\hat f(x)$ is a
polyhedral function with half-integral extreme points $x$, and this property is
preserved after adding an arbitrary combination of constraints of the form
$x_i=x_j$, $x_i=1-x_j$, and $x_i=\gamma$ where $\gamma\in\{0, 1, 1/2}$ is a
constant. A well-known example is the {\em roof duality} relaxation for
quadratic pseudo-boolean functions $f$. We argue that total half-integrality is
a natural requirement for generalizations of roof duality to arbitrary
pseudo-boolean functions. Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a
complete characterization of totally half-integral relaxations $\hat f$ by
establishing a one-to-one correspondence with {\em bisubmodular functions}.
Second, we give a new characterization of bisubmodular functions. Finally, we
show some relationships between general totally half-integral relaxations and
relaxations based on the roof duality."
"The oriented chromatic number of an oriented graph $\vec G$ is the minimum
order of an oriented graph $\vev H$ such that $\vec G$ admits a homomorphism to
$\vev H$. The oriented chromatic number of an undirected graph $G$ is then the
greatest oriented chromatic number of its orientations. In this paper, we
introduce the new notion of the upper oriented chromatic number of an
undirected graph $G$, defined as the minimum order of an oriented graph $\vev
U$ such that every orientation $\vec G$ of $G$ admits a homomorphism to $\vec
U$. We give some properties of this parameter, derive some general upper bounds
on the ordinary and upper oriented chromatic numbers of Cartesian, strong,
direct and lexicographic products of graphs, and consider the particular case
of products of paths."
"In this note we study packing or covering integer programs with at most k
constraints, which are also known as k-dimensional knapsack problems. For any
integer k > 0 and real epsilon > 0, we observe there is a polynomial-sized LP
for the k-dimensional knapsack problem with integrality gap at most 1+epsilon.
The variables may be unbounded or have arbitrary upper bounds. In the packing
case, we can also remove the dependence of the LP on the cost-function,
yielding a polyhedral approximation of the integer hull. This generalizes a
recent result of Bienstock on the classical knapsack problem."
"The problem of estimating the proportion of satisfiable instances of a given
CSP (constraint satisfaction problem) can be tackled through weighting. It
consists in putting onto each solution a non-negative real value based on its
neighborhood in a way that the total weight is at least 1 for each satisfiable
instance. We define in this paper a general weighting scheme for the estimation
of satisfiability of general CSPs. First we give some sufficient conditions for
a weighting system to be correct. Then we show that this scheme allows for an
improvement on the upper bound on the existence of non-trivial cores in 3-SAT
obtained by Maneva and Sinclair (2008) to 4.419. Another more common way of
estimating satisfiability is ordering. This consists in putting a total order
on the domain, which induces an orientation between neighboring solutions in a
way that prevents circuits from appearing, and then counting only minimal
elements. We compare ordering and weighting under various conditions."
"We consider Golomb rulers and their construction. Common rulers feature marks
at every unit measure, distances can often be measured with numerous pairs of
marks. On Golomb rulers, for every distance there are at most two marks
measuring it. The construction of optimal---with respect to shortest length for
given number of marks or maximum number of marks for given length---is
nontrivial, various problems regarding this are NP-complete. We give a
simplified hardness proof for one of them. We use a hypergraph characterization
of rulers and Golomb rulers to illuminate structural properties. This gives
rise to a problem kernel in a fixed-parameter approach to a construction
problem. We also take a short look at the practical implications of these
considerations."
"Consider a class of decomposable combinatorial structures, using different
types of atoms $\Atoms = \{\At_1,\ldots ,\At_{|{\Atoms}|}\}$. We address the
random generation of such structures with respect to a size $n$ and a targeted
distribution in $k$ of its \emph{distinguished} atoms. We consider two
variations on this problem. In the first alternative, the targeted distribution
is given by $k$ real numbers $\TargFreq_1, \ldots, \TargFreq_k$ such that $0 <
\TargFreq_i < 1$ for all $i$ and $\TargFreq_1+\cdots+\TargFreq_k \leq 1$. We
aim to generate random structures among the whole set of structures of a given
size $n$, in such a way that the {\em expected} frequency of any distinguished
atom $\At_i$ equals $\TargFreq_i$. We address this problem by weighting the
atoms with a $k$-tuple $\Weights$ of real-valued weights, inducing a weighted
distribution over the set of structures of size $n$. We first adapt the
classical recursive random generation scheme into an algorithm taking
$\bigO{n^{1+o(1)}+mn\log{n}}$ arithmetic operations to draw $m$ structures from
the $\Weights$-weighted distribution. Secondly, we address the analytical
computation of weights such that the targeted frequencies are achieved
asymptotically, i. e. for large values of $n$. We derive systems of functional
equations whose resolution gives an explicit relationship between $\Weights$
and $\TargFreq_1, \ldots, \TargFreq_k$. Lastly, we give an algorithm in
$\bigO{k n^4}$ for the inverse problem, {\it i.e.} computing the frequencies
associated with a given $k$-tuple $\Weights$ of weights, and an optimized
version in $\bigO{k n^2}$ in the case of context-free languages. This allows
for a heuristic resolution of the weights/frequencies relationship suitable for
complex specifications. In the second alternative, the targeted distribution is
given by a $k$ natural numbers $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ such that
$n_1+\cdots+n_k+r=n$ where $r \geq 0$ is the number of undistinguished atoms.
The structures must be generated uniformly among the set of structures of size
$n$ that contain {\em exactly} $n_i$ atoms $\At_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq k$). We give
a $\bigO{r^2\prod_{i=1}^k n_i^2 +m n k \log n}$ algorithm for generating $m$
structures, which simplifies into a $\bigO{r\prod_{i=1}^k n_i +m n}$ for
regular specifications."
"A multipartite tournament is an orientation of a complete $c$-partite graph.
In [L. Volkmann, A remark on cycles through an arc in strongly connected
multipartite tournaments, Appl. Math. Lett. 20 (2007) 1148--1150], Volkmann
proved that a strongly connected $c$-partite tournament with $c \ge 3$ contains
an arc that belongs to a directed cycle of length $m$ for every $m \in \{3, 4,
\ldots, c\}$. He also conjectured the existence of three arcs with this
property. In this note, we prove the existence of two such arcs."
"We consider the following problem: to decompose a nonnegative integer matrix
into a linear combination of binary matrices that respect the consecutive ones
prop- erty. This problem occurs in the radiotherapy treatment of cancer. The
nonnegative integer matrix corresponds to fields giving the different radiation
beams that a linear accelerator has to send throughout the body of a patient.
Due to the in- homogeneous dose levels, leaves from a multi-leaf collimator are
used between the accelerator and the body of the patient to block the
radiations. The leaves positions can be represented by segments, that are
binary matrices with the consecutive ones property. The aim is to find
efficient decompositions that simultaneously minimize the irradiation time, the
cardinality of the decomposition and the setup-time to configure the multi-leaf
collimator at each step of the decomposition. We propose for this NP-hard
multiobjective combinatorial problem a heuristic, based on the adaptation of
the two-phase Pareto local search. Experiments are carried out on different
size instances and the results are reported."
"In this correspondence, it is given a correction to Theorem 4 in Y. Hu, and

Information Theory, vol. 50, No. 4, pp. 714-719, April 2004."
"In this paper we describe a novel a procedure to build a linear order from an
arbitrary poset which (i) preserves the original ordering and (ii) allows to
extend monotonic and antitonic mappings defined over the original poset to
monotonic and antitonic mappings over the new linear poset."
"This short note presents an efficient way to derive from an exponential
Boltzmann sampler a ordinary Boltzmann sampler"
"A graph $G$ is $(a,b)$-choosable if for any color list of size $a$ associated
with each vertices, one can choose a subset of $b$ colors such that adjacent
vertices are colored with disjoint color sets. This paper shows an equivalence
between the $(a,b)$-choosability of a graph and the $(a,b)$-choosability of one
of its subgraphs called the extended core. As an application, this result
allows to prove the $(5,2)$-choosability and $(7,3)$-colorability of
triangle-free induced subgraphs of the triangular lattice."
"We determine the thresholds for the number of variables, number of clauses,
number of clause intersection pairs and the maximum clause degree of a k-CNF
formula that guarantees satisfiability under the assumption that every two
clauses share at most $\alpha$ variables. More formally, we call these formulas
$\alpha$-intersecting and define, for example, a threshold $\mu_i(k,\alpha)$
for the number of clause intersection pairs $i$, such that every
$\alpha$-intersecting k-CNF formula in which at most $\mu_i(k,\alpha)$ pairs of
clauses share a variable is satisfiable and there exists an unsatisfiable
$\alpha$-intersecting k-CNF formula with $\mu_m(k,\alpha)$ such intersections.
We provide a lower bound for these thresholds based on the Lovasz Local Lemma
and a nearly matching upper bound by constructing an unsatisfiable k-CNF to
show that $\mu_i(k,\alpha) = \tilde{\Theta}(2^{k(2+1/\alpha)})$. Similar
thresholds are determined for the number of variables ($\mu_n =
\tilde{\Theta}(2^{k/\alpha})$) and the number of clauses ($\mu_m =
\tilde{\Theta}(2^{k(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})})$) (see [Scheder08] for an earlier but
independent report on this threshold). Our upper bound construction gives a
family of unsatisfiable formula that achieve all four thresholds
simultaneously."
"The $p$-ary function $f(x)$ mapping $\mathrm{GF}(p^{4k})$ to $\mathrm{GF}(p)$
and given by $f(x)={\rm Tr}_{4k}\big(ax^d+bx^2\big)$ with
$a,b\in\mathrm{GF}(p^{4k})$ and $d=p^{3k}+p^{2k}-p^k+1$ is studied with the
respect to its exponential sum. In the case when either $a^{p^k(p^k+1)}\neq
b^{p^k+1}$ or $a^2=b^d$ with $b\neq 0$, this sum is shown to be three-valued
and the values are determined. For the remaining cases, the value of the
exponential sum is expressed using Jacobsthal sums of order $p^k+1$. Finding
the values and the distribution of those sums is a long-lasting open problem."
"In Graph Minors III, Robertson and Seymour write: ""It seems that the
tree-width of a planar graph and the tree-width of its geometric dual are
approximately equal - indeed, we have convinced ourselves that they differ by
at most one"". They never gave a proof of this. In this paper, we prove a
generalisation of this statement to embedding of hypergraphs on general
surfaces, and we prove that our bound is tight."
"A joint characterisation of the observability and controllability of a
particular kind of discrete system has been developed. The key idea of the
procedure can be reduced to a correct choice of the sampling sequence. This
freedom, owing to the arbitrary choice of the sampling instants, is used to
improve the sensitivity of system observability and controllability, by
exploiting an adequate geometric structure. Some qualitative examples are
presented for illustrative purposes."
"We show the following. \begin{theorem} Let $M$ be an finite-state ergodic
time-reversible Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ and conductance $\phi$.
Let $\lambda \in (0,1)$ be an eigenvalue of $P$. Then, $$\phi^2 + \lambda^2
\leq 1$$ \end{theorem} This strengthens the well-known~\cite{HLW,Dod84, AM85,
Alo86, JS89} inequality $\lambda \leq 1- \phi^2/2$. We obtain our result by a
slight variation in the proof method in \cite{JS89, HLW}; the same method was
used earlier in \cite{RS06} to obtain the same inequality for random walks on
regular undirected graphs."
"We consider the target set selection problem. In this problem, a vertex is
active either if it belongs to a set of initially activated vertices or if at
some point it has at least $k$ active neighbors ($k$ is identical for all
vertices of the graph). Our goal is to find a set of minimum size whose
activation will result with the entire graph being activated. Call such a set
\emph{contagious}. We prove that if $G=(V,E)$ is an undirected graph, the size
of a contagious set is bounded by $\sum_{v\in V}{\min \{1,\frac{k}{d(v)+1}\}}$
(where $d(v)$ is the degree of $v$). We present a simple and efficient
algorithm that finds a contagious set that is not larger than the
aforementioned bound and discuss algorithmic applications of this algorithm to
finding contagious sets in dense graphs."
"In this paper we study a general class of online maximization problems which
are as follows. We are given a time constraint T. We have to choose a sequence
of actions from a set of possible actions and also the length of time to run
each action subject to the total time being no more than T. Each action has a
marginal profit. We show that if the problem has the following two properties,
then there is a greedy algorithm that can yield O(1-1/e) of the optimal.
  -Performing an action earlier does not decrease the marginal profit of the
action. -Running a sequence of actions ""A"" followed by a sequence of actions
""B"" yields at least as much profit as the maximum profit of ""A"" or ""B"".
  The greedy algorithm also has the advantage that it can still be applied in
many settings where complete knowledge of the problem is not available or in
online settings where the input is revealed gradually. We also give examples of
non-trivial problems, for some of which we are not aware of any better
algorithm."
"Given an $n$-ary
  $k-$valued function $f$, $gap(f)$ denotes the essential arity gap of $f$
which is the minimal number of essential variables in $f$ which become fictive
when identifying any two distinct essential variables in $f$. In the present
paper we study the properties of the symmetric function with non-trivial arity
gap ($2\leq gap(f)$). We prove several results concerning decomposition of the
symmetric functions with non-trivial arity gap with its minors or subfunctions.
We show that all non-empty sets of essential variables in symmetric functions
with non-trivial arity gap are separable."
"We give a general framework implementing the Second Moment Method on k-SAT
and discuss the conditions making the Second Moment Method work in this
framework. As applications, we make the Second Moment Method work on boolean
solutions and implicants. We extend this to the distributional model of k-SAT."
"This paper studies two kinds of simulation between cellular automata:
simulations based on factor and simulations based on sub-automaton. We show
that these two kinds of simulation behave in two opposite ways with respect to
the complexity of attractors and factor subshifts. On the one hand, the factor
simulation preserves the complexity of limits sets or column factors (the
simulator CA must have a higher complexity than the simulated CA). On the other
hand, we show that any CA is the sub-automaton of some CA with a simple limit
set (NL-recognizable) and the sub-automaton of some CA with a simple column
factor (finite type). As a corollary, we get intrinsically universal CA with
simple limit sets or simple column factors. Hence we are able to 'hide' the
simulation power of any CA under simple dynamical indicators."
"Consider a sequence of bit strings of length d, such that each string differs
from the next in a constant number of bits. We call this sequence a quasi-Gray
code. We examine the problem of efficiently generating such codes, by
considering the number of bits read and written at each generating step, the
average number of bits read while generating the entire code, and the number of
strings generated in the code. Our results give a trade-off between these
constraints, and present algorithms that do less work on average than previous
results, and that increase the number of bit strings generated."
"Let G be a plane graph with exactly one triangle T and all other cycles of
length at least 5, and let C be a facial cycle of G of length at most six. We
prove that a 3-coloring of C does not extend to a 3-coloring of G if and only
if C has length exactly six and there is a color x such that either G has an
edge joining two vertices of C colored x, or T is disjoint from C and every
vertex of T is adjacent to a vertex of C colored x. This is a lemma to be used
in a future paper of this series."
"A total coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of its vertices and edges such
that no adjacent vertices, edges, and no incident vertices and edges obtain the
same color. An \emph{interval total $t$-coloring} of a graph $G$ is a total
coloring of $G$ with colors $1,2,\...,t$ such that at least one vertex or edge
of $G$ is colored by $i$, $i=1,2,\...,t$, and the edges incident to each vertex
$v$ together with $v$ are colored by $d_{G}(v)+1$ consecutive colors, where
$d_{G}(v)$ is the degree of the vertex $v$ in $G$. In this paper we investigate
some properties of interval total colorings. We also determine exact values of
the least and the greatest possible number of colors in such colorings for some
classes of graphs."
"Given n >= 4 positive real numbers, we prove in this note that they are the
face areas of a convex polyhedron if and only if the largest number is not more
than the sum of the others."
"We study the bandwidth and the pathwidth of multi-dimensional grids. It can
be shown for grids, that these two parameters are equal to a more basic graph
parameter, the vertex boundary width. Using this fact, we determine the
bandwidth and the pathwidth of three-dimensional grids, which were known only
for the cubic case. As a by-product, we also determine the two parameters of
multi-dimensional grids with relatively large maximum factors."
"We are given a graph $G$, an independant set $\mathcal{S} \subset V(G)$ of
\emph{terminals}, and a function $w:V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$. We want to know if
the maximum $w$-packing of vertex-disjoint paths with extremities in
$\mathcal{S}$ is equal to the minimum weight of a vertex-cut separating
$\mathcal{S}$. We call \emph{Mader-Mengerian} the graphs with this property for
each independant set $\mathcal{S}$ and each weight function $w$. We give a
characterization of these graphs in term of forbidden minors, as well as a
recognition algorithm and a simple algorithm to find maximum packing of paths
and minimum multicuts in those graphs."
"Hypercontractive inequalities are a useful tool in dealing with extremal
questions in the geometry of high-dimensional discrete and continuous spaces.
In this survey we trace a few connections between different manifestations of
hypercontractivity, and also present some relatively recent applications of
these techniques in computer science."
"In the paper are computed: the number of binary trees with n nodes and k
leaves; the number of leaves in the set of all binary trees with n nodes. These
are used to compute the number of states in the buddy system."
"We show that if $G$ is a simple triangle-free graph with $n\geq 3$ vertices,
without a perfect matching, and having a minimum degree at least
$\frac{n-1}{2}$, then $G$ is isomorphic either to $C_5$ or to
$K_{\frac{n-1}{2},\frac{n+1}{2}}$."
"A directed graph is called Eulerian, if it contains a tour that traverses
every arc in the graph exactly once. We study the problem of Eulerian extension
(EE) where a directed multigraph G and a weight function is given and it is
asked whether G can be made Eulerian by adding arcs whose total weight does not
exceed a given threshold. This problem is motivated through applications in
vehicle routing and flowshop scheduling. However, EE is NP-hard and thus we use
the parameterized complexity framework to analyze it. In parameterized
complexity, the running time of algorithms is considered not only with respect
to input length, but also with respect to other properties of the input -
called ""parameters"". Dorn et. al. proved that EE can be solved in O(4^k n^4)
time, where k denotes the parameter ""number of arcs that have to be added"". In
this thesis, we analyze EE with respect to the (smaller) parameters ""number c
of connected components in the input graph"" and ""sum b over indeg(v) -
outdeg(v) for all vertices v in the input graph where this value is positive"".
We prove that there is an algorithm for EE whose running time is polynomial
except for the term 4^(c log(bc^2)). To obtain this result, we make several
observations about the sets of arcs that have to be added to the input graph in
order to make it Eulerian. We build upon these observations to restate EE in a
matching context. This matching formulation of EE might be an important tool to
solve the question of whether EE can be solved within running time whose
superpolynomial part depends only on c. We also consider polynomial time
preprocessing routines for EE and show that these routines cannot yield
instances whose size depends polynomially only on either of the parameters b,
c, k unless coNP is contained in NP/poly."
"We propose in this paper a framework dedicated to the construction of what we
call time elastic inner products that allows embedding sets of non-uniformly
sampled multivariate time series of varying lengths into vector space
structures. This framework is based on a recursive definition that covers the
case of multiple embedded time elastic dimensions. We prove that such inner
products exist in our framework and show how a simple instance of this inner
product class operates on some toy applications, while generalizing the
Euclidean inner product."
"In a previous work it was shown that the best measure for the efficiency of a
single burst-correcting code is obtained using the Gallager bound as opposed to
the Reiger bound. In this paper, an efficient algorithm that searches for the
best (shortened) cyclic burst-correcting codes is presented. Using this
algorithm, extensive tables that either tie existing constructions or improve
them are obtained for burst lengths up to b=10."
"Sand pile models are dynamical systems emphasizing the phenomenon of Self
Organized Criticality (SOC). From N stacked grains, iterating evolution rules
leads to some critical configuration where a small disturbance has deep
consequences on the system, involving numerous steps of grain fall. Physicists
L. Kadanoff et al. inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior,
extending the well known Sand Pile Model. In KSPM with parameter D we start
from a pile of N stacked grains and apply the rule: D-1 grains can fall from
column i onto the D-1 adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height
between columns i and i+1 is greater or equal to D. We propose an iterative
study of KSPM evolution where one single grain addition is repeated on a heap
of sand. The sequence of grain falls following a single grain addition is
called an avalanche. From a certain column precisely studied for D=3, we
provide a plain process describing avalanches."
"For a large Markovian model, a ""product form"" is an explicit description of
the steady-state behaviour which is otherwise generally untractable. Being
first introduced in queueing networks, it has been adapted to Markovian Petri
nets. Here we address three relevant issues for product-form Petri nets which
were left fully or partially open: (1) we provide a sound and complete set of
rules for the synthesis; (2) we characterise the exact complexity of classical
problems like reachability; (3) we introduce a new subclass for which the
normalising constant (a crucial value for product-form expression) can be
efficiently computed."
"We study the following problem introduced by Dujmovic et al. Given a tree $T
= (V,E)$, on $n$ vertices, a set of $n$ lines $\mathcal{L}$ in the plane and a
bijection $\iota: V \rightarrow \mathcal{L}$, we are asked to find a
crossing-free straight-line embedding of $T$ so that $v\in \iota(v)$, for all
$v\in V$. We say that a set of $n$ lines $\mathcal{L}$ is universal for trees
if for any tree $T$ and any bijection $\iota$ there exists such an embedding.
We prove that any sufficiently big set of lines is not universal for trees,
which solves an open problem asked by Dujmovic et al."
"The evolution of the largest component has been studied intensely in a
variety of random graph processes, starting in 1960 with the Erd\""os-R\'enyi
process. It is well known that this process undergoes a phase transition at n/2
edges when, asymptotically almost surely, a linear-sized component appears.
Moreover, this phase transition is continuous, i.e., in the limit the function
f(c) denoting the fraction of vertices in the largest component in the process
after cn edge insertions is continuous. A variation of the Erd\""os-R\'enyi
process are the so-called Achlioptas processes in which in every step a random
pair of edges is drawn, and a fixed edge-selection rule selects one of them to
be included in the graph while the other is put back. Recently, Achlioptas,
D'Souza and Spencer (2009) gave strong numerical evidence that a variety of
edge-selection rules exhibit a discontinuous phase transition. However, Riordan
and Warnke (2011) very recently showed that all Achlioptas processes have a
continuous phase transition. In this work we prove discontinuous phase
transitions for a class of Erd\""os-R\'enyi-like processes in which in every
step we connect two vertices, one chosen randomly from all vertices, and one
chosen randomly from a restricted set of vertices."
"Fuzzy circular interval graphs are a generalization of proper circular arc
graphs and have been recently introduced by Chudnovsky and Seymour as a
fundamental subclass of claw-free graphs. In this paper, we provide a
polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing such graphs, and more importantly for
building a suitable representation."
"A word $w$ is called synchronizing (recurrent, reset, magic, directable) word
of deterministic finite automaton (DFA) if $w$ sends all states of the
automaton to a unique state. In 1964 Jan \v{C}erny found a sequence of n-state
complete DFA possessing a minimal synchronizing word of length $(n-1)^2$. He
conjectured that it is an upper bound on the length of such words for complete
DFA. Nevertheless, the best upper bound $(n^3-n)/6$ was found almost 30 years
ago. We reduce the upper bound on the length of the minimal synchronizing word
to $n(7n^2+6n-16)/48$. An implemented algorithm for finding synchronizing word
with restricted upper bound is described. The work presents the distribution of
all synchronizing automata of small size according to the length of an almost
minimal synchronizing word."
"The post-enrolment course timetabling (PE-CTT) is one of the most studied
timetabling problems, for which many instances and results are available. In
this work we design a metaheuristic approach based on Simulated Annealing to
solve the PE-CTT. We consider all the different variants of the problem that
have been proposed in the literature and we perform a comprehensive
experimental analysis on all the public instances available. The outcome is
that our solver, properly engineered and tuned, performs very well on all
cases, providing the new best known results on many instances and
state-of-the-art values for the others."
"Given three permutations on the integers 1 through n, consider the set system
consisting of each interval in each of the three permutations. Jozsef Beck
conjectured (c. 1987) that the discrepancy of this set system is O(1). We give
a counterexample to this conjecture: for any positive integer n = 3^k, we
exhibit three permutations whose corresponding set system has discrepancy
Omega(log(n)). Our counterexample is based on a simple recursive construction,
and our proof of the discrepancy lower bound is by induction. This example also
disproves a generalization of Beck's conjecture due to Spencer, Srinivasan and
Tetali, who conjectured that a set system corresponding to l permutations has
discrepancy O(sqrt(l))."
"Token ring topology has been frequently used in the design of distributed
loop computer networks and one measure of its performance is the diameter. We
propose an algorithm for constructing hamiltonian graphs with $n$ vertices and
maximum degree $\Delta$ and diameter $O (\log n)$, where $n$ is an arbitrary
number. The number of edges is asymptotically bounded by $(2 - \frac{1}{\Delta
- 1} - \frac{(\Delta - 2)^2}{(\Delta - 1)^3}) n$. In particular, we construct a
family of hamiltonian graphs with diameter at most $2 \lfloor \log_2 n
\rfloor$, maximum degree 3 and at most $1+11n/8$ edges."
"Breakpoint graphs are ubiquitous structures in the field of genome
rearrangements. Their cycle decomposition has proved useful in computing and
bounding many measures of (dis)similarity between genomes, and studying the
distribution of those cycles is therefore critical to gaining insight on the
distributions of the genomic distances that rely on it. We extend here the work
initiated by Doignon and Labarre, who enumerated unsigned permutations whose
breakpoint graph contains $k$ cycles, to signed permutations, and prove
explicit formulas for computing the expected value and the variance of the
corresponding distributions, both in the unsigned case and in the signed case.
We also compare these distributions to those of several well-studied distances,
emphasising the cases where approximations obtained in this way stand out.
Finally, we show how our results can be used to derive simpler proofs of other
previously known results."
"We show that synchronism can significantly impact on network behaviours, in
particular by filtering unstable attractors induced by a constraint of
asynchronism. We investigate and classify the different possible impacts that
an addition of synchronism may have on the behaviour of a Boolean automata
network. We show how these relate to some strong specific structural
properties, thus supporting the idea that for most networks, synchronism only
shortcuts asynchronous trajectories. We end with a discussion on the close
relation that apparently exists between sensitivity to synchronism and
non-monotony."
"This article is set in the field of regulation networks modeled by discrete
dynamical systems. It focuses on Boolean automata networks. In such networks,
there are many ways to update the states of every element. When this is done
deterministically, at each time step of a discretised time flow and according
to a predefined order, we say that the network is updated according to
block-sequential update schedule (blocks of elements are updated sequentially
while, within each block, the elements are updated synchronously). Many
studies, for the sake of simplicity and with some biologically motivated
reasons, have concentrated on networks updated with one particular
block-sequential update schedule (more often the synchronous/parallel update
schedule or the sequential update schedules). The aim of this paper is to give
an argument formally proven and inspired by biological considerations in favour
of the fact that the choice of a particular update schedule does not matter so
much in terms of the possible and likely dynamical behaviours that networks may
display."
"An edge dominating set of a graph G=(V,E) is a subset M of edges in the graph
such that each edge in E-M is incident with at least one edge in M. In an
instance of the parameterized edge dominating set problem we are given a graph
G=(V,E) and an integer k and we are asked to decide whether G has an edge
dominating set of size at most k. In this paper we show that the parameterized
edge dominating set problem can be solved in O^*(2.3147^k) time and polynomial
space. We show that this problem can be reduced to a quadratic kernel with
O(k^3) edges."
"Let $n$ be a positive integer and $X = [x_{ij}]_{1 \leq i, j \leq n}$ be an
$n \times n$\linebreak \noindent sized matrix of independent random variables
having joint uniform distribution $$\hbox{Pr} {x_{ij} = k \hbox{for} 1 \leq k
\leq n} = \frac{1}{n} \quad (1 \leq i, j \leq n) \koz. $$ A realization
$\mathcal{M} = [m_{ij}]$ of $X$ is called \textit{good}, if its each row and
each column contains a permutation of the numbers $1, 2,..., n$. We present and
analyse four typical algorithms which decide whether a given realization is
good."
"In this paper we introduce and study a new complexity measure for finite
words. For positive integer $d$ special scattered subwords, called
super-$d$-subwords, in which the gaps are of length at least $(d-1)$, are
defined. We give methods to compute super-$d$-complexity (the total number of
different super-$d$-subwords) in the case of rainbow words (with pairwise
different letters) by recursive algorithms, by mahematical formulas and by
graph algorithms. In the case of general words, with letters from a given
alphabet without any restriction, the problem of the maximum value of the
super-$d$-complexity of all words of length $n$ is presented."
"Special scattered subwords, in which the gaps are of length from a given set,
are defined. The scattered subword complexity, which is the number of such
scattered subwords, is computed for rainbow words."
"3-list colouring is an NP-complete decision problem. It is hard even on
planar bipartite graphs. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for solving 3-list
colouring on permutation graphs."
"Let G be a planar graph and F a set of additional edges not yet in G. The
multiple edge insertion problem (MEI) asks for a drawing of G+F with the
minimum number of pairwise edge crossings, such that the subdrawing of G is
plane. Finding an exact solution to MEI is NP-hard for general F. We present
the first polynomial time algorithm for MEI that achieves an additive
approximation guarantee -- depending only on the size of F and the maximum
degree of G, in the case of connected G. Our algorithm seems to be the first
directly implementable one in that realm, too, next to the single edge
insertion. It is also known that an (even approximate) solution to the MEI
problem would approximate the crossing number of the F-almost-planar graph G+F,
while computing the crossing number of G+F exactly is NP-hard already when
|F|=1. Hence our algorithm induces new, improved approximation bounds for the
crossing number problem of F-almost-planar graphs, achieving constant-factor
approximation for the large class of such graphs of bounded degrees and bounded
size of F."
"We propose a preprocessing algorithm for the multiway cut problem that
establishes its polynomial kernelizability when the difference between the
parameter $k$ and the size of the smallest isolating cut is at most $log(k)$.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first progress towards kernelization
of the multiway cut problem. We pose two open questions that, if answered
affirmatively, would imply, combined with the proposed result, unconditional
polynomial kernelizability of the multiway cut problem."
"For a simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the first Zagreb
index and the second Zagreb index are defined as $M_1(G)=\sum_{v\in V}d(v)^2 $
and $M_2(G)=\sum_{uv\in E}d(u)d(v)$. In \cite{VGFAD}, it was shown that if a
connected graph $G$ has maximal degree 4, then $G$ satisfies $M_1(G)/n =
M_2(G)/m$ (also known as the Zagreb indices equality) if and only if $G$ is
regular or biregular of class 1 (a biregular graph whose no two vertices of
same degree are adjacent). There, it was also shown that there exist infinitely
many connected graphs of maximal degree $\Delta= 5$ that are neither regular
nor biregular of class 1 which satisfy the Zagreb indices equality. Here, we
generalize that result by showing that there exist infinitely many connected
graphs of maximal degree $\Delta \geq 5$ that are neither regular nor biregular
graphs of class 1 which satisfy the Zagreb indices equality. We also consider
when the above equality holds when the degrees of vertices of a given graph are
in a prescribed interval of integers."
"In this paper, we look at the improvement of our knowledge on a family of
tilings of the hyperbolic plane which is brought in by the use of Sergeyev's
numeral system based on grossone. It appears that the information we can get by
using this new numeral system depends on the way we look at the tilings. The
ways are significantly different but they confirm some results which were
obtained in the traditional but constructive frame and allow us to obtain an
additional precision with respect to this information."
"In this paper, we look at how to count the number of elements of a set within
the frame of Sergeyev's numeral system. We also look at the connection between
the number of elements of a set and the notion of bijection in this new
setting. We also show the difference between this new numeral system and the
results of the traditional naive set theory."
"Sand pile models are dynamical systems describing the evolution from $N$
stacked grains to a stable configuration. It uses local rules to depict grain
moves and iterate it until reaching a fixed configuration from which no rule
can be applied. The main interest of sand piles relies in their {\em Self
Organized Criticality} (SOC), the property that a small perturbation | adding
some sand grains | on a fixed configuration has uncontrolled consequences on
the system, involving an arbitrary number of grain fall. Physicists L. Kadanoff
{\em et al} inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior, extending
the well known {\em Sand Pile Model}. In KSPM($D$), we start from a pile of $N$
stacked grains and apply the rule: $D-1$ grains can fall from column $i$ onto
the $D-1$ adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height between
columns $i$ and $i+1$ is greater or equal to $D$. This paper develops a formal
background for the study of KSPM fixed points. This background, resumed in a
finite state word transducer, is used to provide a plain formula for fixed
points of KSPM(3)."
"Let $G$ be a finite undirected graph with edge set $E$. An edge set $E'
\subseteq E$ is an {\em induced matching} in $G$ if the pairwise distance of
the edges of $E'$ in $G$ is at least two; $E'$ is {\em dominating} in $G$ if
every edge $e \in E \setminus E'$ intersects some edge in $E'$. The
\emph{Dominating Induced Matching Problem} (\emph{DIM}, for short) asks for the
existence of an induced matching $E'$ which is also dominating in $G$; this
problem is also known as the \emph{Efficient Edge Domination} Problem.
  The DIM problem is related to parallel resource allocation problems, encoding
theory and network routing. It is \NP-complete even for very restricted graph
classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree three. However, its
complexity was open for $P_k$-free graphs for any $k \ge 5$; $P_k$ denotes a
chordless path with $k$ vertices and $k-1$ edges. We show in this paper that
the weighted DIM problem is solvable in linear time for $P_7$-free graphs in a
robust way."
"In this work we study the polytope associated with a 0,1-integer programming
formulation for the Equitable Coloring Problem. We find several families of
valid inequalities and derive sufficient conditions in order to be
facet-defining inequalities. We also present computational evidence that shows
the efficacy of these inequalities used in a cutting-plane algorithm."
"In this work we study the polytope associated with a 0/1 integer programming
formulation for the Equitable Coloring Problem. We find several families of
valid inequalities and derive sufficient conditions in order to be
facet-defining inequalities. We also present computational evidence of the
effectiveness of including these inequalities as cuts in a Branch & Cut
algorithm."
"In this paper, a set of transformations T^(p,k) is defined on N_0^K to N_0.
Some basic and na\""ive mathematical structure of T^(p,1) are adumbrated and
introduced the concept of discrete dynamical systems through IVTs. Latterly,
some further research scope of IVTs is highlighted."
"Given a Boolean function f, the quantity ess(f) denotes the largest set of
assignments that falsify f, no two of which falsify a common implicate of f.
Although ess(f)$ is clearly a lower bound on cnf_size(f) (the minimum number of
clauses in a CNF formula for f), Cepek et al. showed that it is not, in
general, a tight lower bound. They gave examples of functions f for which there
is a small gap between ess(f) and cnf_size(f). We demonstrate significantly
larger gaps. We show that the gap can be exponential in n for arbitrary Boolean
functions, and Theta(sqrt{n}) for Horn functions, where n is the number of
variables of f. We also introduce a natural extension of the quantity ess(f),
which we call ess_k(f), which is the largest set of assignments, no k of which
falsify a common implicate of f."
"Alternative novel measures of the distance between any two partitions of a
n-set are proposed and compared, together with a main existing one, namely
'partition-distance' D(.,.). The comparison achieves by checking their
restriction to modular elements of the partition lattice, as well as in terms
of suitable classifiers. Two of the new measures obtain through the size, a
function mapping every partition into the number of atoms finer than that
partition. One of these size-based distances extends to geometric lattices the
traditional Hamming distance between subsets, when these latter are regarded as
hypercube vertexes or binary n-vectors. After carefully framing the
environment, a main comparison finally results from the following bounding
problem: for every value k, with 0<k<n, of partition-distance D(.,.), determine
the minimum and maximum of the 'indicator-Hamming' distance d(P,Q) proposed
here over all pairs of partitions P,Q such that D(P,Q)=k."
"A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a {\it unipolar graph} if there exits a partition $V=V_1
\cup V_2$ such that, $V_1$ is a clique and $V_2$ induces the disjoint union of
cliques. The complement-closed class of {\it generalized split graphs} are
those graphs $G$ such that either $G$ {\it or} the complement of $G$ is
unipolar. Generalized split graphs are a large subclass of perfect graphs. In
fact, it has been shown that almost all $C_5$-free (and hence, almost all
perfect graphs) are generalized split graphs. In this paper we present a
recognition algorithm for unipolar graphs that utilizes a minimal triangulation
of the given graph, and produces a partition when one exists. Our algorithm has
running time O($nm^\prime$), where $m^\prime$ is the number of edges in a
minimal triangulation of the given graph. Generalized split graphs can
recognized via this algorithm in O($nm' + n\OL{m}'$) = O($n^3$) time. We give
algorithms on unipolar graphs for finding a maximum independent set and a
minimum clique cover in O($n+m$) time and for finding a maximum clique and a
minimum proper coloring in O($n^{2.5}/\log n$), when a unipolar partition is
given. These algorithms yield algorithms for the four optimization problems on
generalized split graphs that have the same worst-case time bound. We also
prove that the perfect code problem is NP-Complete for unipolar graphs."
"Partial words are sequences over a finite alphabet that may contain wildcard
symbols, called holes, which match or are compatible with all letters; partial
words without holes are said to be full words (or simply words). Given an
infinite partial word w, the number of distinct full words over the alphabet
that are compatible with factors of w of length n, called subwords of w, refers
to a measure of complexity of infinite partial words so-called subword
complexity. This measure is of particular interest because we can construct
partial words with subword complexities not achievable by full words. In this
paper, we consider the notion of recurrence over infinite partial words, that
is, we study whether all of the finite subwords of a given infinite partial
word appear infinitely often, and we establish connections between subword
complexity and recurrence in this more general framework."
"This contribution is devoted to the study of positional numeration systems
with negative base introduced by Ito and Sadahiro in 2009, called
(-\beta)-expansions. We give an admissibility criterion for more general case
of (-\beta)-expansions and discuss the properties of the set of
(-\beta)-integers. We give a description of distances within this set and show
that this set can be coded by an infinite word over an infinite alphabet, which
is a fixed point of a non-erasing non-trivial morphism."
"An infinite permutation is a linear order on the set N. We study the
properties of infinite permutations generated by fixed points of some uniform
binary morphisms, and find the formula for their complexity."
"Given a countable set X (usually taken to be the natural numbers or
integers), an infinite permutation, \pi, of X is a linear ordering of X. This
paper investigates the combinatorial complexity of infinite permutations on the
natural numbers associated with the image of uniformly recurrent aperiodic
binary words under the letter doubling map. An upper bound for the complexity
is found for general words, and a formula for the complexity is established for
the Sturmian words and the Thue-Morse word."
"Professor Cadogan at the University of the West Indies identified special
starting points that yield long subsequences where the normalization constant,
k, is always one. I studied these special sequences and found an implicit mixed
integer equation in closed form which if solved would produce seed values in
cycling subsequences. Such cycles only occur among extremely large numbers,
causing the equation to be difficult to solve numerically."
"A k-fold x-coloring of a graph is an assignment of (at least) k distinct
colors from the set {1, 2, ..., x} to each vertex such that any two adjacent
vertices are assigned disjoint sets of colors. The smallest number x such that
G admits a k-fold x-coloring is the k-th chromatic number of G, denoted by
\chi_k(G). We determine the exact value of this parameter when G is a web or an
antiweb. Our results generalize the known corresponding results for odd cycles
and imply necessary and sufficient conditions under which \chi_k(G) attains its
lower and upper bounds based on the clique, the fractional chromatic and the
chromatic numbers. Additionally, we extend the concept of \chi-critical graphs
to \chi_k-critical graphs. We identify the webs and antiwebs having this
property, for every integer k <= 1."
"This paper presents a generalization of the sandpile model, called the
parallel symmetric sandpile model, which inherits the rules of the symmetric
sandpile model and implements them in parallel. In this new model, at each step
the collapsing of the collapsible columns happens at the same time and one
collapsible column is able to collapse on the left or on the right but not
both. We prove that the set of forms of fixed points of the symmetric sandpile
model is the same as the one of that model using parallel update scheme by
constructing explicitly the way (in the parallel update scheme) to reach the
form of an arbitrary fixed point of the sequential model."
"The use of algebraic techniques to solve combinatorial problems is studied in
this paper. We formulate the rainbow connectivity problem as a system of
polynomial equations. We first consider the case of two colors for which the
problem is known to be hard and we then extend the approach to the general
case. We also give a formulation of the rainbow connectivity problem as an
ideal membership problem."
"Given an undirected graph $G$ with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, and non-negative
edge weights, and given an integer $k\geq 1$, we show that for some universal
constant $c$, a $(2k-1)$-approximate distance oracle for $G$ of size $O(kn^{1 +
1/k})$ can be constructed in $O(\sqrt km + kn^{1 + c/\sqrt k})$ time and can
answer queries in $O(k)$ time. We also give an oracle which is faster for
smaller $k$. Our results break the quadratic preprocessing time bound of
Baswana and Kavitha for all $k\geq 6$ and improve the $O(kmn^{1/k})$ time bound
of Thorup and Zwick except for very sparse graphs and small $k$. When $m =
\Omega(n^{1 + c/\sqrt k})$ and $k = O(1)$, our oracle is optimal w.r.t.\ both
stretch, size, preprocessing time, and query time, assuming a widely believed
girth conjecture by Erd\H{o}s."
"For the first time a mathematical object is presented - a reversible cellular
Automaton - with many paradoxical qualities, the main ones among them are: a
frequent quickly return to its original state, the presence of a large number
of conservation laws and paradoxical ""fuzzy"" symmetries, which connects the
current position of the automaton with its signature Main Integral."
"The Subgraph Isomorphism problem asks, given a host graph G on n vertices and
a pattern graph P on k vertices, whether G contains a subgraph isomorphic to P.
The restriction of this problem to planar graphs has often been considered.
After a sequence of improvements, the current best algorithm for planar graphs
is a linear time algorithm by Dorn (STACS '10), with complexity $2^{O(k)}
O(n)$.
  We generalize this result, by giving an algorithm of the same complexity for
graphs that can be embedded in surfaces of bounded genus. At the same time, we
simplify the algorithm and analysis. The key to these improvements is the
introduction of surface split decompositions for bounded genus graphs, which
generalize sphere cut decompositions for planar graphs. We extend the algorithm
for the problem of counting and generating all subgraphs isomorphic to P, even
for the case where P is disconnected. This answers an open question by Eppstein
(SODA '95 / JGAA '99)."
"The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem that is at the core of many real-world optimization
problems. We prove that QAP can be written as the sum of three elementary
landscapes when the swap neighborhood is used. We present a closed formula for
each of the three elementary components and we compute bounds for the
autocorrelation coefficient."
"In this paper, we focus on a multi-queue buffer management in which packets
of different values are segregated in different queues. Our model consists of m
packets values and m queues. Recently, Al-Bawani and Souza (arXiv:1103.6049v2
[cs.DS] 30 Mar 2011) presented an online multi-queue buffer management
algorithm Greedy and showed that it is 2-competitive for the general m-valued
case, i.e., m packet values are 0 < v_{1} < v_{2} < ... < v_{m}, and
(1+v_{1}/v_{2})-competitive for the two-valued case, i.e., two packet values
are 0 < v_{1} < v_{2}. For the general m-valued case, let c_i = (v_{i} +
\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^{j-1} v_{i-j})/(v_{i+1} + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}2^{j-1}v_{i-j})
for 1 \leq i \leq m-1, and let c_{m}^{*} = \max_{i} c_{i}. In this paper, we
precisely analyze the competitive ratio of Greedy for the general m-valued
case, and show that the algorithm Greedy is (1+c_{m}^{*})-competitive."
"This note presents an encoding and a decoding algorithms for a forest of
(labelled) rooted uniform hypertrees and hypercycles in linear time, by using
as few as $n - 2$ integers in the range $[1,n]$. It is a simple extension of
the classical Pr\""{u}fer code for (labelled) rooted trees to an encoding for
forests of (labelled) rooted uniform hypertrees and hypercycles, which allows
to count them up according to their number of vertices, hyperedges and
hypertrees. In passing, we also find Cayley's formula for the number of
(labelled) rooted trees as well as its generalisation to the number of
hypercycles found by Selivanov in the early 70's."
"We present a tight lower bound for the spanning tree congestion of Hamming
graphs."
"An acyclic USO on a hypercube is formed by directing its edges in such as way
that the digraph is acyclic and each face of the hypercube has a unique sink
and a unique source. A path to the global sink of an acyclic USO can be modeled
as pivoting in a unit hypercube of the same dimension with an abstract
objective function, and vice versa. In such a way, Zadeh's 'least entered rule'
and other history based pivot rules can be applied to the problem of finding
the global sink of an acyclic USO. In this paper we present some theoretical
and empirical results on the existence of acyclic USOs for which the various
history based pivot rules can be made to follow a Hamiltonian path. In
particular, we develop an algorithm that can enumerate all such paths up to
dimension 6 using efficient pruning techniques. We show that Zadeh's original
rule admits Hamiltonian paths up to dimension 9 at least, and prove that most
of the other rules do not for all dimensions greater than 5."
"In this paper, our aim is to prove that our recursive algorithm to solve the
""Reve's puzzle"" (four- peg Tower of Hanoi) is the optimal solution according to
minimum number of moves. Here we used Frame's five step algorithm to solve the
""Reve's puzzle"", and proved its optimality analyzing all possible strategies to
solve the problem. Minimum number of moves is important because no one ever
proved that the ""presumed optimal"" solution, the Frame-Stewart algorithm,
always gives the minimum number of moves. The basis of our proof is Bifurcation
Theorem. In fact, we can solve generalized ""Tower of Hanoi"" puzzle for any pegs
(three or more pegs) using Bifurcation Theorem. But our scope is limited to the
""Reve's puzzle"" in this literature, but lately, we would discuss how we can
reach our final destination, the Generalized Tower of Hanoi Strategy. Another
important point is that we have used only induction method to prove all the
results throughout this literature. Moreover, some simple theorems and lemmas
are derived through logical perspective or consequence of induction method.
Lastly, we will try to answer about uniqueness of solution of this famous
puzzle."
"A floorplan is a rectangular dissection which describes the relative
placement of electronic modules on the chip. It is called a mosaic floorplan if
there are no empty rooms or cross junctions in the rectangular dissection. We
study a subclass of mosaic floorplans called hierarchical floorplans of order
$k$ (abbreviated HFO-${k}$). A floorplan is HFO-$k$ if it can be obtained by
starting with a single rectangle and recursively embedding mosaic floorplans of
at most $k$ rooms inside the rooms of intermediate floorplans. When $k=2$ this
is exactly the class of slicing floorplans as the only distinct floorplans with
two rooms are a room with a vertical slice and a room with a horizontal slice
respectdeively. And embedding such a room is equivalent to slicing the parent
room vertically/horizontally. In this paper we characterize permutations
corresponding to the Abe-labeling of HFO-$k$ floorplans and also give an
algorithm for identification of such permutations in linear time for any
particular $k$. We give a recurrence relation for exact number of HFO-5
floorplans with $n$ rooms which can be easily extended to any $k$ also. Based
on this recurrence we provide a polynomial time algorithm to generate the
number of HFO-$k$ floorplans with $n$ rooms. Considering its application in
VLSI design we also give moves on HFO-$k$ family of permutations for
combinatorial optimization using simulated annealing etc. We also explore some
interesting properties of Baxter permutations which have a bijective
correspondence with mosaic floorplans."
"We consider random systems of equations x_1 + ... + x_k = a; 0 <= a <= 2
which are interpreted as equations modulo 3: We show for k >= 15 that the
satisfiability threshold of such systems occurs where the 2-core has density 1:
We show a similar result for random uniquely extendible constraints over 4
elements. Our results extend previous results of Dubois/Mandler for equations
mod 2 and k = 3 and Connamacher/Molloy for uniquely extendible constraints over
a domain of 4 elements with k = 3 arguments. Our proof technique is based on
variance calculations, using a technique introduced Dubois/Mandler. However,
several additional observations (of independent interest) are necessary."
"In this note, we point out two major errors in the paper ""Minimizing total
tardiness on parallel machines with preemptions"" by Kravchenko and Werner
[2010]. More precisely, they proved that both problems P|pmtn|sum(Tj) and P|rj,
pj = p, pmtn|sum(Tj) are NP-Hard. We give a counter-example to their proofs,
letting the complexity of these two problems open."
"In this paper, we are interested in parallel identical machine scheduling
problems with preemption and release dates in case of a regular criterion to be
minimized. We show that solutions having a permutation flow shop structure are
dominant if there exists an optimal solution with completion times scheduled in
the same order as the release dates, or if there is no release date. We also
prove that, for a subclass of these problems, the completion times of all jobs
can be ordered in an optimal solution. Using these two results, we provide new
results on polynomially solvable problems and hence refine the boundary between
P and NP for these problems."
"The Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) algorithm is a comprehensive
tool to perform quantifier elimination over real closed fields. CAD has doubly
exponential running time, making it infeasible for practical purposes. We
propose to use the notions of clause normal forms and virtual substitutions to
develop a preprocessor for CAD, that will enable an input-level parallelism. We
study the performance of CAD in the presence of the preprocessor by extensive
experimentation. Since parallelizability of CAD depends on the structure of
given prenex formula, we introduce some structural notions to study the
performance of CAD with the proposed preprocessor."
"Block elimination algorithms for solving sparse discrete optimization
problems are considered. The numerical example is provided. The benchmarking is
done in order to define real computational capabilities of block elimination
algorithms combined with SYMPHONY solver. Analysis of the results show that for
sufficiently large number of blocks and small enough size of separators between
the blocks for staircase integer linear programming problem the local
elimination algorithms in combination with a solver for solving subproblems in
blocks allow to solve such problems much faster than used solver itself for
solving the whole problem. Also the capabilities of postoptimal analysis (warm
starting) are considered for solving packages of integer linear programming
problems for corresponding blocks."
"In this paper we study identifying codes, locating-dominating codes, and
total-dominating codes in Sierpinski graphs. We compute the minimum size of
such codes in Sierpinski graphs."
"We show tight necessary and sufficient conditions on the sizes of small
bipartite graphs whose union is a larger bipartite graph that has no large
bipartite independent set. Our main result is a common generalization of two
classical results in graph theory: the theorem of K\H{o}v\'{a}ri, S\'{o}s and
Tur\'{a}n on the minimum number of edges in a bipartite graph that has no large
independent set, and the theorem of Hansel (also Katona and Szemer\'{e}di,
Krichevskii) on the sum of the sizes of bipartite graphs that can be used to
construct a graph (non-necessarily bipartite) that has no large independent
set.
  As an application of our results, we show how they unify the underlying
combinatorial principles developed in the proof of tight lower bounds for
depth-two superconcentrators."
"This article studies the poset of simple permutations with respect to the
pattern involvement. We specify results on critically indecomposable posets
obtained by Schmerl and Trotter to simple permutations and prove that if
$\sigma, \pi$ are two simple permutations such that $\pi < \sigma$ then there
exists a chain of simple permutations $\sigma^{(0)} = \sigma, \sigma^{(1)},
..., \sigma^{(k)}=\pi$ such that $|\sigma^{(i)}| - |\sigma^{(i+1)}| = 1$ - or 2
when permutations are exceptional- and $\sigma^{(i+1)} < \sigma^{(i)}$. This
characterization induces an algorithm polynomial in the size of the output to
compute the simple permutations in a wreath-closed permutation class."
"We introduce a generalization of the well known graph (vertex) coloring
problem, which we call the problem of \emph{component coloring of graphs}.
Given a graph, the problem is to color the vertices using minimum number of
colors so that the size of each connected component of the subgraph induced by
the vertices of the same color does not exceed $C$. We give a linear time
algorithm for the problem on proper interval graphs. We extend this algorithm
to solve two weighted versions of the problem in which vertices have integer
weights. In the \emph{splittable} version the weights of vertices can be split
into differently colored parts, however, the total weight of a monochromatic
component cannot exceed $C$. For this problem on proper interval graphs we give
a polynomial time algorithm. In the \emph{non-splittable} version the vertices
cannot be split. Using the algorithm for the splittable version we give a
2-approximation algorithm for the non-splittable problem on proper interval
graphs which is NP-hard. We also prove that even the unweighted version of the
problem is NP-hard for split graphs."
"Integral Value Transformation (IVT) is a family of transformations from N0kto
N0. An algebraic result has been established in p-adic IVT systems and an
application of the result is described in this paper. The result in this paper
provides the rule to find the pth pre image of a natural number for the Collatz
like bijective functions in p-adic IVT systems. Using this result a routing
algorithm is proposed. This proposed routing algorithm reduces number of
address calculation."
"A normal odd partition T of the edges of a cubic graph is a partition into
trails of odd length (no repeated edge) such that each vertex is the end vertex
of exactly one trail of the partition and internal in some trail. For each
vertex v, we can distinguish the edge for which this vertex is pending. Three
normal odd partitions are compatible whenever these distinguished edges are
distinct for each vertex. We examine this notion and show that a cubic 3
edge-colorable graph can always be provided with three compatible normal odd
partitions. The Petersen graph has this property and we can construct other
cubic graphs with chromatic index four with the same property. Finally, we
propose a new conjecture which, if true, would imply the well known Fan and
Raspaud Conjecture"
"The notion of a $\delta$-minimum edge-colouring was introduced by J-L.
Fouquet (in his french PhD Thesis \cite{FouPhD}). Here we present some
structural properties of $\delta$-minimum edge-colourings, partially taken from
the above thesis. The paper serves as an auxiliary tool for another paper
submitted by the authors to Graphs and Combinatorics."
"For integers $k>0$ and $0<r \leq \Delta$ (where $r \leq k$), a conditional
$(k,r)$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper $k$-coloring of the vertices of $G$
such that every vertex $v$ of degree $d(v)$ in $G$ is adjacent to vertices with
at least $\min\{r, d(v)\}$ differently colored neighbors. The smallest integer
$k$ for which a graph $G$ has a conditional $(k,r)$-coloring is called the
$r$th order conditional chromatic number, denoted by $\chi_r(G)$. For different
values of $r$ we first give results (exact values or bounds for $\chi_r(G)$
depending on $r$) related to the conditional coloring of graphs. Then we obtain
$\chi_r(G)$ of certain parameterized graphs viz., windmill graph, line graph of
windmill graph, middle graph of friendship graph, middle graph of a cycle, line
graph of friendship graph, middle graph of complete $k$-partite graph, middle
graph of a bipartite graph and gear graph. Finally we introduce \emph{unique
conditional colorability} and give some related results."
"We propose an Economic - Probabilistic analogy: the category of cost is
analogous to the category of Probability. The proposed analogy permits
construction of an informal theory of nonlinear non-convex Gaussian Utility and
Cost, which describes the real economic processes more adequately than a theory
based on a linear and convex models. Based on the proposed analogy, we build a
nonlinear non-convex planning model with a Gaussian optimality criterion -
Gaussian Programming Model. We also describe a corresponding model of
Generalized Piecewise-Linear Programming that can be used to approximate a
Gaussian Programming model, and vice verse. Proposed constructions are
illustrated on a numerical example."
"In this paper, we study the connectivity in one-dimensional ad hoc wireless
networks with an fixed access point. In recent years, various closed
expressions for the probability of connectivity on one-dimensional networks
(interval graphs) have been derived by many researchers. We will provide some
numerical validation for them by means of extensive simulations."
"Let $G$ be a graph with a threshold function $\theta:V(G)\rightarrow
\mathbb{N}$ such that $1\leq \theta(v)\leq d_G(v)$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$,
where $d_G(v)$ is the degree of $v$ in $G$. Suppose we are given a target set
$S\subseteq V(G)$. The paper considers the following repetitive process on $G$.
At time step 0 the vertices of $S$ are colored black and the other vertices are
colored white. After that, at each time step $t>0$, the colors of white
vertices (if any) are updated according to the following rule. All white
vertices $v$ that have at least $\theta(v)$ black neighbors at the time step
$t-1$ are colored black, and the colors of the other vertices do not change.
The process runs until no more white vertices can update colors from white to
black. The following optimization problem is called Target Set Selection:
Finding a target set $S$ of smallest possible size such that all vertices in
$G$ are black at the end of the process. Such an $S$ is called an {\em optimal
target set} for $G$ under the threshold function $\theta$. We are interested in
finding an optimal target set for the well-known class of honeycomb networks
under an important threshold function called {\em strict majority threshold},
where $\theta(v)=\lceil (d_G(v)+1)/2\rceil$ for each vertex $v$ in $G$. In a
graph $G$, a {\em feedback vertex set} is a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that
the subgraph induced by $V(G)\setminus S$ is cycle-free. In this paper we give
exact value on the size of the optimal target set for various kinds of
honeycomb networks under strict majority threshold, and as a by-product we also
provide a minimum feedback vertex set for different kinds regular graphs in the
class of honeycomb networks"
"Consider a random bipartite multigraph $G$ with $n$ left nodes and $m \geq n
\geq 2$ right nodes. Each left node $x$ has $d_x \geq 1$ random right
neighbors. The average left degree $\Delta$ is fixed, $\Delta \geq 2$. We ask
whether for the probability that $G$ has a left-perfect matching it is
advantageous not to fix $d_x$ for each left node $x$ but rather choose it at
random according to some (cleverly chosen) distribution. We show the following,
provided that the degrees of the left nodes are independent: If $\Delta$ is an
integer then it is optimal to use a fixed degree of $\Delta$ for all left
nodes. If $\Delta$ is non-integral then an optimal degree-distribution has the
property that each left node $x$ has two possible degrees, $\floor{\Delta}$ and
$\ceil{\Delta}$, with probability $p_x$ and $1-p_x$, respectively, where $p_x$
is from the closed interval $[0,1]$ and the average over all $p_x$ equals
$\ceil{\Delta}-\Delta$. Furthermore, if $n=c\cdot m$ and $\Delta>2$ is
constant, then each distribution of the left degrees that meets the conditions
above determines the same threshold $c^*(\Delta)$ that has the following
property as $n$ goes to infinity: If $c<c^*(\Delta)$ then there exists a
left-perfect matching with high probability. If $c>c^*(\Delta)$ then there
exists no left-perfect matching with high probability. The threshold
$c^*(\Delta)$ is the same as the known threshold for offline $k$-ary cuckoo
hashing for integral or non-integral $k=\Delta$."
"The activities, in project scheduling, can be represented graphically in two
different ways, by either assigning the activities to the nodes 'AoN' directed
acyclic graph (dag) or to the arcs 'AoA dag'. In this paper, a new algorithm is
proposed for generating, for a given project scheduling problem, an
Activity-on-Arc dag starting from the Activity-on-Node dag using the concepts
of line graphs of graphs."
"We prove that the solutions to the k-peg Tower of Hanoi Problem given by
Frame and Stewart are minimal."
"We first introduce the Hamming distance between two strings. Then, we apply
this concept to the representations of whole numbers in base n for all positive
integers n > 2. We claim that a simple formula exists for the sum of all
Hamming distances between pairs of consec- utive integers from 1 to m, which we
will derive. We also state and prove other interesting results concerning the
aforementioned topic."
"A random number generator is proposed based on a theorem about existence of
chaos in fixed point iteration of x= cot2(x). Digital computer simulation of
this function iteration exhibits random behavior. A method is proposed to
extract random bytes from this simulation. Diehard and NIST test suite for
randomness detection is run on this bytes, and it is found to pass all the
tests in the suite. Thus, this method qualifies even for cryptographic quality
random number generation."
"In practical purposes for some geometrical problems in computer science we
have as information the coordinates of some finite points in surface instead of
the whole body of a surface. The problem arised here is: ""How to define a
distance function in a finite space?"" as we will show the appropriate function
for this purpose is not a metric function. Here we try to define this distance
function in order to apply it in further proposes, specially in the field
setting of transportation theory and vehicle routing problem. More precisely in
this paper we consider VRP problem for two dimensional manifolds in R3."
"Perfect matchings and maximum weight matchings are two fundamental
combinatorial structures. We consider the ratio between the maximum weight of a
perfect matching and the maximum weight of a general matching. Motivated by the
computer graphics application in triangle meshes, where we seek to convert a
triangulation into a quadrangulation by merging pairs of adjacent triangles, we
focus mainly on bridgeless cubic graphs. First, we characterize graphs that
attain the extreme ratios. Second, we present a lower bound for all bridgeless
cubic graphs. Third, we present upper bounds for subclasses of bridgeless cubic
graphs, most of which are shown to be tight. Additionally, we present tight
bounds for the class of regular bipartite graphs."
"A partially embedded graph (or PEG) is a triple (G,H,\H), where G is a graph,
H is a subgraph of G, and \H is a planar embedding of H. We say that a PEG
(G,H,\H) is planar if the graph G has a planar embedding that extends the
embedding \H.
  We introduce a containment relation of PEGs analogous to graph minor
containment, and characterize the minimal non-planar PEGs with respect to this
relation. We show that all the minimal non-planar PEGs except for finitely many
belong to a single easily recognizable and explicitly described infinite
family. We also describe a more complicated containment relation which only has
a finite number of minimal non-planar PEGs.
  Furthermore, by extending an existing planarity test for PEGs, we obtain a
polynomial-time algorithm which, for a given PEG, either produces a planar
embedding or identifies an obstruction."
"Sampling permutations from S_n is a fundamental problem from probability
theory. The nearest neighbor transposition chain \cal{M}}_{nn} is known to
converge in time \Theta(n^3 \log n) in the uniform case and time \Theta(n^2) in
the constant bias case, in which we put adjacent elements in order with
probability p \neq 1/2 and out of order with probability 1-p. Here we consider
the variable bias case where we put adjacent elements x<y in order with
probability p{x,y} and out of order with probability 1-p_{x,y}. The problem of
bounding the mixing rate of M_{nn} was posed by Fill and was motivated by the
Move-Ahead-One self-organizing list update algorithm. It was conjectured that
the chain would always be rapidly mixing if 1/2 \leq p_{x,y} \leq 1 for all x <
y, but this was only known in the case of constant bias or when p_{x,y} is
equal to 1/2 or 1, a case that corresponds to sampling linear extensions of a
partial order. We prove the chain is rapidly mixing for two classes: ""Choose
Your Weapon,"" where we are given r_1,..., r_{n-1} with r_i \geq 1/2 and
p_{x,y}=r_x for all x<y (so the dominant player chooses the game, thus fixing
his or her probability of winning), and ""League Hierarchies,"" where there are
two leagues and players from the A-league have a fixed probability of beating
players from the B-league, players within each league are similarly divided
into sub-leagues with a possibly different fixed probability, and so forth
recursively. Both of these classes include permutations with constant bias as a
special case. Moreover, we also prove that the most general conjecture is false
by constructing a counterexample where 1/2 \leq p_{x,y} \leq 1 for all x< y,
but for which the nearest neighbor transposition chain requires exponential
time to converge."
"Determining whether an unordered collection of overlapping substrings (called
shingles) can be uniquely decoded into a consistent string is a problem that
lies within the foundation of a broad assortment of disciplines ranging from
networking and information theory through cryptography and even genetic
engineering and linguistics. We present three perspectives on this problem: a
graph theoretic framework due to Pevzner, an automata theoretic approach from
our previous work, and a new insight that yields a time-optimal streaming
algorithm for determining whether a string of $n$ characters over the alphabet
$\Sigma$ can be uniquely decoded from its two-character shingles. Our algorithm
achieves an overall time complexity $\Theta(n)$ and space complexity
$O(|\Sigma|)$. As an application, we demonstrate how this algorithm can be
extended to larger shingles for efficient string reconciliation."
"We investigate here the hardness of conjugacy and factorization of subshifts
of finite type (SFTs) in dimension $d>1$. In particular, we prove that the
factorization problem is $\Sigma^0_3$-complete and the conjugacy problem
$\Sigma^0_1$-complete in the arithmetical hierarchy."
"In this paper we extend general grid graphs to the grid graphs consist of
polygons tiling on a plane, named polygonal grid graphs. With a cycle basis
satisfied polygons tiling, we study the cyclic structure of Hamilton graphs. A
Hamilton cycle can be expressed as a symmetric difference of a subset of cycles
in the basis. From the combinatorial relations of vertices in the subset of
cycles in the basis, we deduce the formula of inside faces in Grinberg theorem,
called Grinberg equation, and derive a kind of cycles whose existence make a
polygonal grid graph non-Hamiltonian, called non-Hamiltonian holes, and then we
characterize the existence condition of non-Hamiltonian holes and obtain the
necessary and sufficient condition of a polygonal grid graph to be Hamiltonian.
The result in this paper provides a new starting point for developing a
polynomial-time algorithm for Hamilton problem in general grid graphs."
"Given a Boolean function f on n variables, a Disjoint Sum-of-Products (DSOP)
of f is a set of products (ANDs) of subsets of literals whose sum (OR) equals
f, such that no two products cover the same minterm of f. DSOP forms are a
special instance of partial DSOPs, i.e. the general case where a subset of
minterms must be covered exactly once and the other minterms (typically
corresponding to don't care conditions of $f$) can be covered any number of
times. We discuss finding DSOPs and partial DSOP with a minimal number of
products, a problem theoretically connected with various properties of Boolean
functions and practically relevant in the synthesis of digital circuits.
Finding an absolute minimum is hard, in fact we prove that the problem of
absolute minimization of partial DSOPs is NP-hard. Therefore it is crucial to
devise a polynomial time heuristic that compares favorably with the known
minimization tools. To this end we develop a further piece of theory starting
from the definition of the weight of a product p as a functions of the number
of fragments induced on other cubes by the selection of p, and show how product
weights can be exploited for building a class of minimization heuristics for
DSOP and partial DSOP synthesis. A set of experiments conducted on major
benchmark functions show that our method, with a family of variants, always
generates better results than the ones of previous heuristics, including the
method based on a BDD representation of f."
"In this paper we continue the study of the edge intersection graphs of one
(or zero) bend paths on a rectangular grid. That is, the edge intersection
graphs where each vertex is represented by one of the following shapes:
$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$, $\urcorner$, $\lrcorner$, and we consider zero bend
paths (i.e., | and $-$) to be degenerate $\llcorner$s. These graphs, called
$B_1$-EPG graphs, were first introduced by Golumbic et al (2009). We consider
the natural subclasses of $B_1$-EPG formed by the subsets of the four single
bend shapes (i.e., {$\llcorner$}, {$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$},
{$\llcorner$,$\urcorner$}, and {$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$,$\urcorner$}) and we
denote the classes by [$\llcorner$], [$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$],
[$\llcorner$,$\urcorner$], and [$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$,$\urcorner$]
respectively. Note: all other subsets are isomorphic to these up to 90 degree
rotation. We show that testing for membership in each of these classes is
NP-complete and observe the expected strict inclusions and incomparability
(i.e., [$\llcorner$] $\subsetneq$ [$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$],
[$\llcorner$,$\urcorner$] $\subsetneq$ [$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$,$\urcorner$]
$\subsetneq$ $B_1$-EPG; also, [$\llcorner$,$\ulcorner$] is incomparable with
[$\llcorner$,$\urcorner$]). Additionally, we give characterizations and
polytime recognition algorithms for special subclasses of Split $\cap$
[$\llcorner$]."
"A graph G is dually chordal if there is a spanning tree T of G such that any
maximal clique of G induces a subtree in T. This paper investigates the
Colourability problem on dually chordal graphs. It will show that it is
NP-complete in case of four colours and solvable in linear time with a simple
algorithm in case of three colours. In addition, it will be shown that a dually
chordal graph is 3-colourable if and only if it is perfect and has no clique of
size four."
"A quadrangulation is a graph embedded on the sphere such that each face is
bounded by a walk of length 4, parallel edges allowed. All quadrangulations can
be generated by a sequence of graph operations called vertex splitting,
starting from the path P_2 of length 2. We define the degree D of a splitting S
and consider restricted splittings S_{i,j} with i <= D <= j. It is known that
S_{2,3} generate all simple quadrangulations.
  Here we investigate the cases S_{1,2}, S_{1,3}, S_{1,1}, S_{2,2}, S_{3,3}.
First we show that the splittings S_{1,2} are exactly the monotone ones in the
sense that the resulting graph contains the original as a subgraph. Then we
show that they define a set of nontrivial ancestors beyond P_2 and each
quadrangulation has a unique ancestor.
  Our results have a direct geometric interpretation in the context of
mechanical equilibria of convex bodies. The topology of the equilibria
corresponds to a 2-coloured quadrangulation with independent set sizes s, u.
The numbers s, u identify the primary equilibrium class associated with the
body by V\'arkonyi and Domokos. We show that both S_{1,1} and S_{2,2} generate
all primary classes from a finite set of ancestors which is closely related to
their geometric results.
  If, beyond s and u, the full topology of the quadrangulation is considered,
we arrive at the more refined secondary equilibrium classes. As Domokos,
L\'angi and Szab\'o showed recently, one can create the geometric counterparts
of unrestricted splittings to generate all secondary classes. Our results show
that S_{1,2} can only generate a limited range of secondary classes from the
same ancestor. The geometric interpretation of the additional ancestors defined
by monotone splittings shows that minimal polyhedra play a key role in this
process. We also present computational results on the number of secondary
classes and multiquadrangulations."
"The many endless rivers of text now available present a serious challenge in
the task of gleaning, analyzing and discovering useful information. In this
paper, we describe a methodology for visualizing text streams in real time. The
approach automatically groups similar messages into ""countries,"" with keyword
summaries, using semantic analysis, graph clustering and map generation
techniques. It handles the need for visual stability across time by dynamic
graph layout and Procrustes projection techniques, enhanced with a novel stable
component packing algorithm. The result provides a continuous, succinct view of
evolving topics of interest. It can be used in passive mode for overviews and
situational awareness, or as an interactive data exploration tool. To make
these ideas concrete, we describe their application to an online service called
TwitterScope."
"List colouring is an NP-complete decision problem even if the total number of
colours is three. It is hard even on planar bipartite graphs. We give a
polynomial-time algorithm for solving list colouring of permutation graphs with
a bounded total number of colours. More generally we give a polynomial-time
algorithm that solves the list-homomorphism problem to any fixed target graph
for a large class of input graphs including all permutation and interval
graphs."
"Two independent Poisson streams of jobs flow into a single-server service
system having a limited common buffer that can hold at most one job. If a
type-i job (i=1,2) finds the server busy, it is blocked and routed to a
separate type-i retrial (orbit) queue that attempts to re-dispatch its jobs at
its specific Poisson rate. This creates a system with three dependent queues.
Such a queueing system serves as a model for two competing job streams in a
carrier sensing multiple access system. We study the queueing system using
multi-dimensional probability generating functions, and derive its necessary
and sufficient stability conditions while solving a boundary value problem.
Various performance measures are calculated and numerical results are
presented."
"The flooding games, which are called Flood-It, Mad Virus, or HoneyBee, are a
kind of coloring games and they have been becoming popular online. In these
games, each player colors one specified cell in his/her turn, and all connected
neighbor cells of the same color are also colored by the color. This flooding
or coloring spreads on the same color cells. It is natural to consider these
new coloring games on more general boards, or general graphs. Recently,
computational complexities of the variants of the flooding games on several
graph classes have been studied. In this paper, we investigate the flooding
games on some graph classes characterized by interval representations. Our
results state that the number of colors is a key parameter to determine the
computational complexity of the flooding games. When the number of colors is a
fixed constant, these games can be solved in polynomial time on an interval
graph. On the other hand, if the number of colors is not bounded, the flooding
game is NP-complete on a proper interval graph. We also state similar results
for split graphs."
"We provide an example of a monotone Boolean function on the hypercube given
by a low depth decision tree that is not well approximated by any k-junta for
small k."
"The stable allocation problem is one of the broadest extensions of the
well-known stable marriage problem. In an allocation problem, edges of a
bipartite graph have capacities and vertices have quotas to fill. Here we
investigate the case of uncoordinated processes in stable allocation instances.
In this setting, a feasible allocation is given and the aim is to reach a
stable allocation by raising the value of the allocation along blocking edges
and reducing it on worse edges if needed. Do such myopic changes lead to a
stable solution?
  In our present work, we analyze both better and best response dynamics from
an algorithmic point of view. With the help of two deterministic algorithms we
show that random procedures reach a stable solution with probability one for
all rational input data in both cases. Surprisingly, while there is a
polynomial path to stability when better response strategies are played (even
for irrational input data), the more intuitive best response steps may require
exponential time. We also study the special case of correlated markets. There,
random best response strategies lead to a stable allocation in expected
polynomial time."
"The {\it crossing number} of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of pairwise
intersections of edges in a drawing of $G$. In this paper, we study the
crossing numbers of $K_{m}\times P_n$ and $K_{m}\times C_n$."
"In the standard Category of Graphs, the graphs allow only one edge to be
incident to any two vertices, not necessarily distinct, and the graph morphisms
must map edges to edges and vertices to vertices while preserving incidence. We
refer to these graph morphisms as Strict Morphisms. We relax the condition on
the graphs allowing any number of edges to be incident to any two vertices, as
well as relaxing the condition on graph morphisms by allowing edges to be
mapped to vertices, provided that incidence is still preserved. We call this
broader graph category The Category of Conceptual Graphs, and define four other
graph categories created by combinations of restrictions of the graph morphisms
as well as restrictions on the allowed graphs. We investigate which Lawvere
axioms for the category of Sets and Functions apply to each of these Categories
of Graphs, as well as the other categorial constructions of free objects,
projective objects, generators, and their categorial duals."
"For an undirected, simple, finite, connected graph $G$, we denote by $V(G)$
and $E(G)$ the sets of its vertices and edges, respectively. A function
$\varphi:E(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,t\}$ is called a proper edge $t$-coloring of a
graph $G$, if adjacent edges are colored differently and each of $t$ colors is
used. The least value of $t$ for which there exists a proper edge $t$-coloring
of a graph $G$ is denoted by $\chi'(G)$. For any graph $G$, and for any integer
$t$ satisfying the inequality $\chi'(G)\leq t\leq |E(G)|$, we denote by
$\alpha(G,t)$ the set of all proper edge $t$-colorings of $G$. Let us also
define a set $\alpha(G)$ of all proper edge colorings of a graph $G$: $$
\alpha(G)\equiv\bigcup_{t=\chi'(G)}^{|E(G)|}\alpha(G,t). $$
  An arbitrary nonempty finite subset of consecutive integers is called an
interval. If $\varphi\in\alpha(G)$ and $x\in V(G)$, then the set of colors of
edges of $G$ which are incident with $x$ is denoted by $S_G(x,\varphi)$ and is
called a spectrum of the vertex $x$ of the graph $G$ at the proper edge
coloring $\varphi$. If $G$ is a graph and $\varphi\in\alpha(G)$, then define
$f_G(\varphi)\equiv|\{x\in V(G)/S_G(x,\varphi) \textrm{is an interval}\}|$.
  For a graph $G$ and any integer $t$, satisfying the inequality $\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq |E(G)|$, we define: $$
\mu_1(G,t)\equiv\min_{\varphi\in\alpha(G,t)}f_G(\varphi),\qquad
\mu_2(G,t)\equiv\max_{\varphi\in\alpha(G,t)}f_G(\varphi). $$
  For any graph $G$, we set: $$ \mu_{11}(G)\equiv\min_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_1(G,t),\qquad \mu_{12}(G)\equiv\max_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_1(G,t), $$ $$ \mu_{21}(G)\equiv\min_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_2(G,t),\qquad \mu_{22}(G)\equiv\max_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_2(G,t). $$
  For the Petersen graph, the exact values of the parameters $\mu_{11}$,
$\mu_{12}$, $\mu_{21}$ and $\mu_{22}$ are found."
"Communication-based train control (CBTC) is gradually adopted in urban rail
transit systems, as it can significantly enhance railway network efficiency,
safety and capacity. Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground
tunnels and trains move in high speed, building a train-ground wireless
communication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel
channels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC
systems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique
characteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic
moving direction, and accurate train location information. In this paper, we
develop a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model for tunnel channels in CBTC
systems. The proposed FSMC model is based on real field CBTC channel
measurements obtained from a business operating subway line. Unlike most
existing channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the
proposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more
accurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver
is divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The
accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results
generated from the model and the real field measurement results."
"This material is dedicated to the estimation of the chromatic number and
chromatic class of the conjugated triangulation (first conversion) and also of
the second conversion of the planar triangulation. Also this paper introduces
some new hypotheses, which are equivalent to Four Color Problem."
"Morpion Solitaire is a pencil-and-paper game for a single player. A move in
this game consists of putting a cross at a lattice point and then drawing a
line segment that passes through exactly five consecutive crosses. The
objective is to make as many moves as possible, starting from a standard
initial configuration of crosses. For one of the variants of this game, called
5D, we prove an upper bound of 121 on the number of moves. This is done by
introducing line-based analysis, and improves the known upper bound of 138
obtained by potential-based analysis."
"The Heuristic Ratio Estimation (HRE) approach proposes a new way of using the
pairwise comparisons matrix. It allows the assumption that the weights of some
alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) are known and fixed, hence the
weight vector needs to be estimated only for the other unknown values. The main
purpose of this paper is to extend the previously proposed iterative HRE
algorithm and present all the heuristics that create a generalized approach.
Theoretical considerations are accompanied by a few numerical examples
demonstrating how the selected heuristics can be used in practice."
"Suppose that in the four tests Alice's scores are 90, 95, 85, 90, and Bob's
scores are 85, 95, 90, 90. How to evaluate their scores? In this paper, we
introduce the concept of ordered probability mass function which can be used to
find a probability mass function with smaller variance. More interestingly, we
can use it to distinguish sequences of positive numbers statistically."
"Given a linear recurrence sequence (LRS) over the integers, the Positivity
Problem} asks whether all terms of the sequence are positive. We show that, for
simple LRS (those whose characteristic polynomial has no repeated roots) of
order 9 or less, Positivity is decidable, with complexity in the Counting
Hierarchy."
"Given a tree and a set ${\cal P}$ of non-trivial simple paths on it,
$VPT({\cal P})$ is the VPT graph (i.e. the vertex intersection graph) of the
paths ${\cal P}$ of the tree $T$, and $EPT({\cal P})$ is the EPT graph (i.e.
the edge intersection graph) of ${\cal P}$. These graphs have been extensively
studied in the literature. Given two (edge) intersecting paths in a graph,
their \emph{split vertices} is the set of vertices having degree at least $3$
in their union. A pair of (edge) intersecting paths is termed
\emph{non-splitting} if they do not have split vertices (namely if their union
is a path).
  In this work, motivated by an application in all-optical networks, we define
the graph $ENPT({\cal P})$ of edge-intersecting non-splitting paths of a tree,
termed the ENPT graph, as the (edge) graph having a vertex for each path in
${\cal P}$, and an edge between every pair of paths that are both
edge-intersecting and non-splitting. A graph $G$ is an ENPT graph if there is a
tree $T$ and a set of paths ${\cal P}$ of $T$ such that $G=ENPT({\cal P})$, and
we say that $<T,{\cal P}>$ is a \emph{representation} of $G$. We first show
that cycles, trees and complete graphs are ENPT graphs.
  Our work follows the lines of Golumbic and Jamison's research in which they
defined the EPT graph class, and characterized the representations of chordless
cycles (holes). It turns out that ENPT holes have a more complex structure than
EPT holes. In our analysis, we assume that the EPT graph corresponding to a
representation of an ENPT hole is given. We also introduce three assumptions
$(P1)$, $(P2)$, $(P3)$ defined on EPT, ENPT pairs of graphs. In this Part I,
using the results of Golumbic and Jamison as building blocks, we characterize
(a) EPT, ENPT pairs that satisfy $(P1)$, $(P2)$, $(P3)$, and (b) the unique
minimal representation of such pairs."
"Bit-flip mutation is a common mutation operator for evolutionary algorithms
applied to optimize functions over binary strings. In this paper, we develop
results from the theory of landscapes and Krawtchouk polynomials to exactly
compute the probability distribution of fitness values of a binary string
undergoing uniform bit-flip mutation. We prove that this probability
distribution can be expressed as a polynomial in p, the probability of flipping
each bit. We analyze these polynomials and provide closed-form expressions for
an easy linear problem (Onemax), and an NP-hard problem, MAX-SAT. We also
discuss some implications of the results for runtime analysis."
"Given a graph G, a non-negative integer h and a set of vertices S, the
h-extra connectivity of G is the cardinality of a minimum set S such that G-S
is disconnected and each component of G-S has at least h+1 vertices. The
2-extra connectivity of k-ary n-cube is gotten by Hsieh et al. in [Theoretical
Computer Science, 443 (2012) 63-69]. In this paper, we obtained the h-extra
connectivity of the k-ary n-cube networks for h=3."
"Given a tree and a set P of non-trivial simple paths on it, VPT(P) is the VPT
graph (i.e. the vertex intersection graph) of the paths P, and EPT(P) is the
EPT graph (i.e. the edge intersection graph) of P. These graphs have been
extensively studied in the literature. Given two (edge) intersecting paths in a
graph, their split vertices is the set of vertices having degree at least 3 in
their union. A pair of (edge) intersecting paths is termed non-splitting if
they do not have split vertices (namely if their union is a path). We define
the graph ENPT(P) of edge intersecting non-splitting paths of a tree, termed
the ENPT graph, as the graph having a vertex for each path in P, and an edge
between every pair of vertices representing two paths that are both
edge-intersecting and non-splitting. A graph G is an ENPT graph if there is a
tree T and a set of paths P of T such that G=ENPT(P), and we say that <T,P> is
a representation of G.
  Our goal is to characterize the representation of chordless ENPT cycles
(holes). To achieve this goal, we first assume that the EPT graph induced by
the vertices of an ENPT hole is given. In [2] we introduce three assumptions
(P1), (P2), (P3) defined on EPT, ENPT pairs of graphs. In the same study, we
define two problems HamiltonianPairRec, P3-HamiltonianPairRec and characterize
the representations of ENPT holes that satisfy (P1), (P2), (P3).
  In this work, we continue our work by relaxing these three assumptions one by
one. We characterize the representations of ENPT holes satisfying (P3) by
providing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve P3-HamiltonianPairRec. We also
show that there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm to solve
HamiltonianPairRec, unless P=NP."
"In this paper, we discussed about the intuitionistic fuzzy linear
transformations (IFLT) and shown that the set of all linear transformations
L(V) defined over an intuitionistic fuzzy vector space V does not form an
vector space. Here we determine the unique intuitionistic fuzzy matrix
associated with an intuitionistic fuzzy linear transformation with respect to
an ordered standard basis for an intuitionistic fuzzy vector space. We
introduced the concept of the inverse of an IFLT."
"Concepts of graph theory have applications in many areas of computer science
including data mining, image segmentation, clustering, image capturing,
networks, etc . An interval-valued fuzzy set is a generalization of the notion
of a fuzzy set. Interval-valued fuzzy models give more precision, flexibility
and compatibility to the system as compared to the fuzzy models. In this paper,
we introduce the concept of antipodal interval - valued fuzzy graph and self
median interval-valued fuzzy graph of the given interval-valued fuzzy graph. We
investigate isomorphism properties of antipodal interval - valued fuzzy graphs."
"Brooks' Theorem [R. L. Brooks, On Colouring the Nodes of a Network, Proc.
Cambridge Philos. Soc.} 37:194-197, 1941] states that every graph $G$ with
maximum degree $\Delta$, has a vertex-colouring with $\Delta$ colours, unless
$G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case $\Delta+1$ colours are
required. Lov\'asz [L. Lov\'asz, Three short proofs in graph theory, J. Combin.
Theory Ser. 19:269-271, 1975] gives an algorithmic proof of Brooks' Theorem.
Unfortunately this proof is missing important details and it is thus unclear
whether it leads to a linear time algorithm. In this paper we give a complete
description of the proof of Lov\'asz, and we derive a linear time algorithm for
determining the vertex-colouring guaranteed by Brooks' Theorem."
"The synchronizing word of deterministic automaton is a word in the alphabet
of colors (considered as letters) of its edges that maps the automaton to a
single state. A coloring of edges of a directed graph is synchronizing if the
coloring turns the graph into deterministic finite automaton possessing a
synchronizing word.
  The road coloring problem is a problem of synchronizing coloring of directed
finite strongly connected graph with constant outdegree of all its vertices if
the greatest common divisor of lengths of all its cycles is one. The problem
was posed by Adler, Goodwyn and Weiss over 30 years ago and evoked a noticeable
interest among the specialists in theory of graphs, deterministic automata and
symbolic dynamics. The problem is described even in ""Wikipedia"" - the popular
Internet Encyclopedia. The positive solution of the road coloring problem is
presented."
"The subject of the 5th challenge proposed by the French Society of Operations
Research and Decision Analysis (ROADEF) consists in scheduling technicians and
interventions for telecommunications
(http://www.g-scop.inpg.fr/ChallengeROADEF2007/ or http://www.roadef.org/). We
detail the algorithm we proposed for this challenge which is a Greedy
Randomized Adaptative Search Procedure (GRASP). Computational results led us to
the 1st position in the Junior category and to the 4th position in All category
of the Challenge ROADEF 2007."
"A word w is called synchronizing (recurrent, reset, directed) word of a
deterministic finite automaton (DFA) if w sends all states of the automaton on
a unique state. Jan Cerny had found in 1964 a sequence of n-state complete DFA
with shortest synchronizing word of length (n-1)^2. He had conjectured that it
is an upper bound for the length of the shortest synchronizing word for any
$n$-state complete DFA.
  The examples of DFA with shortest synchronizing word of length (n-1)^2 are
relatively rare. To the Cerny sequence were added in all examples of Cerny,
Piricka and Rosenauerova (1971), of Kari (2001) and of Roman (2004).
  By help of a program based on some effective algorithms, a wide class of
automata of size less than 11 was checked. The order of the algorithm finding
synchronizing word is quadratic for overwhelming majority of known to date
automata. Some new examples of n-state DFA with minimal synchronizing word of
length (n-1)^2 were discovered. The program recognized some remarkable trends
concerning the length of the minimal synchronizing word.

"Overlap-free words are words over the binary alphabet $A=\{a, b\}$ that do
not contain factors of the form $xvxvx$, where $x \in A$ and $v \in A^*$. We
analyze the asymptotic growth of the number $u_n$ of overlap-free words of
length $n$ as $ n \to \infty$. We obtain explicit formulas for the minimal and
maximal rates of growth of $u_n$ in terms of spectral characteristics (the
lower spectral radius and the joint spectral radius) of certain sets of
matrices of dimension $20 \times 20$. Using these descriptions we provide new
estimates of the rates of growth that are within 0.4% and $0.03 %$ of their
exact values. The best previously known bounds were within 11% and 3%
respectively. We then prove that the value of $u_n$ actually has the same rate
of growth for ``almost all'' natural numbers $n$. This ``average'' growth is
distinct from the maximal and minimal rates and can also be expressed in terms
of a spectral quantity (the Lyapunov exponent). We use this expression to
estimate it. In order to obtain our estimates, we introduce new algorithms to
compute spectral characteristics of sets of matrices. These algorithms can be
used in other contexts and are of independent interest."
We show the Graceful Tree Conjecture holds.
"We show that for all graphs H of size n, the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$ has an
$H$-decomposition."
"This paper has been withdrawn by the author, due an error in claim 1."
"Consider partial maps from the free monoid into the field of real numbers
with a rational domain. We show that two families of such series are actually
the same: the unambiguous rational series on the one hand, and the max-plus and
min-plus rational series on the other hand. The decidability of equality was
known to hold in both families with different proofs, so the above unifies the
picture. We give an effective procedure to build an unambiguous automaton from
a max-plus automaton and a min-plus one that recognize the same series."
"We show a general result known as the Erdos_Sos Conjecture: if
$E(G)>{1/2}(k-1)n$ where $G$ has order $n$ then $G$ contains every tree of
order $k+1$ as a subgraph."
"Topological dynamics of cellular automata (CA), inherited from classical
dynamical systems theory, has been essentially studied in dimension 1. This
paper focuses on 2D CA and aims at showing that the situation is different and
more complex. The main results are the existence of non sensitive CA without
equicontinuous points, the non-recursivity of sensitivity constants and the
existence of CA having only non-recursive equicontinuous points. They all show
a difference between the 1D and the 2D case. Thanks to these new constructions,
we also extend undecidability results concerning topological classification
previously obtained in the 1D case."
"We propose a Dynamical Boolean Network (DBN), which is a Virtual Boolean
Network (VBN) whose set of states is fixed but whose transition matrix can
change from one discrete time step to another. The transition matrix $T_{k}$ of
our DBN for time step $k$ is of the form $Q^{-1}TQ$, where $T$ is a transition
matrix (of a VBN) defined at time step $k$ in the course of the construction of
our DBN and $Q$ is the matrix representation of some randomly chosen
permutation $P$ of the states of our DBN. For each of several classes of such
permutations, we carried out a number of simulations of a DBN with two nodes;
each of our simulations consisted of 1,000 trials of 10,000 time steps each. In
one of our simulations, only six of the 16 possible single-node transition
rules for a VBN with two nodes were visited a total of 300,000 times (over all
1,000 trials). In that simulation, linearity appears to play a significant role
in that three of those six single-node transition rules are transition rules of
a Linear Virtual Boolean Network (LVBN); the other three are the negations of
the first three. We also discuss the notions of a Probabilistic Boolean Network
and a Hidden Markov Model--in both cases, in the context of using an arbitrary
(though not necessarily one-to-one) function to label the states of a VBN."
"We show a new lower bound for the maximum number of runs in a string. We
prove that for any e > 0, (a -- e)n is an asymptotic lower bound, where a =
56733/60064 = 0.944542. It is superior to the previous bound 0.927 given by
Franek et al. Moreover, our construction of the strings and the proof is much
simpler than theirs."
"A D0L-system is a triple (A, f, w) where A is a finite alphabet, f is an
endomorphism of the free monoid over A, and w is a word over A. The
D0L-sequence generated by (A, f, w) is the sequence of words (w, f(w), f(f(w)),
f(f(f(w))), ...). The corresponding sequence of lengths, that is the function
mapping each non-negative integer n to |f^n(w)|, is called the growth function
of (A, f, w). In 1978, Salomaa and Soittola deduced the following result from
their thorough study of the theory of rational power series: if the
D0L-sequence generated by (A, f, w) is not eventually the empty word then there
exist a non-negative integer d and a real number b greater than or equal to one
such that |f^n(w)| behaves like n^d b^n as n tends to infinity. The aim of the
present paper is to present a short, direct, elementary proof of this theorem."
"The paper presents an analysis on the use of integrals defined for
non-additive measures (or capacities) as the Choquet and the \Sipos{} integral,
and the multilinear model, all seen as extensions of pseudo-Boolean functions,
and used as a means to model interaction between criteria in a multicriteria
decision making problem. The emphasis is put on the use, besides classical
comparative information, of information about difference of attractiveness
between acts, and on the existence, for each point of view, of a ``neutral
level'', allowing to introduce the absolute notion of attractive or repulsive
act. It is shown that in this case, the Sipos integral is a suitable solution,
although not unique. Properties of the Sipos integral as a new way of
aggregating criteria are shown, with emphasis on the interaction among
criteria."
"In this work we present a simple and efficient algorithm which, with high
probability, provides an almost uniform sample from the set of proper
k-colourings on an instance of a sparse random graph G(n,d/n), where k=k(d) is
a sufficiently large constant. Our algorithm is not based on the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method (M.C.M.C.). Instead, we provide a novel proof of correctness
of our Algorithm that is based on interesting ""spatial mixing"" properties of
colourings of G(n,d/n). Our result improves upon previous results (based on
M.C.M.C.) that required a number of colours growing unboundedly with n."
"In this paper we propose a generalization of the concept of symmetric fuzzy
measure based in a decomposition of the universal set in what we have called
subsets of indifference. Some properties of these measures are studied, as well
as their Choquet integral. Finally, a degree of interaction between the subsets
of indifference is defined."
"In the matching interdiction problem, we are given an undirected graph with
weights and interdiction costs on the edges and seek to remove a subset of the
edges constrained to some budget, such that the weight of a maximum weight
matching in the remaining graph is minimized. In this work we introduce the
matching interdiction problem and show that it is strongly NP-complete even
when the input is restricted to simple, bipartite graphs with unit edge weights
and unit interdiction costs. Furthermore, we present a pseudo-polynomial
algorithm for solving the matching interdiction problem on graphs with bounded
treewidth. The proposed algorithm extends the approach that is typically used
for the creation of efficient algorithms on graphs with bounded treewidth to
interdiction problems."
"This paper classifies binary morphisms that map to ultimately periodic words.
In particular, if a morphism h maps an infinite non-ultimately periodic word to
an ultimately periodic word then it must be true that h(0) commutes with h(1)."
"In this work we give precise asymptotic expressions on the probability of the
existence of fixed-size components at the threshold of connectivity for random
geometric graphs."
"A pair of clauses in a CNF formula constitutes a conflict if there is a
variable that occurs positively in one clause and negatively in the other. A
CNF formula without any conflicts is satisfiable. The Lovasz Local Lemma
implies that a k-CNF formula is satisfiable if each clause conflicts with at
most 2^k/e-1 clauses. It does not, however, give any good bound on how many
conflicts an unsatisfiable formula has globally. We show here that every
unsatisfiable k-CNF formula requires 2.69^k conflicts and there exist
unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas with 3.51^k conflicts."
"We bound the mean distance in a connected graph which is not a tree in
function of its order $n$ and its girth $g$. On one hand, we show that mean
distance is at most $\frac{n+1}{3}-\frac{g(g^2-4)}{12n(n-1)}$ if $g$ is even
and at most $\frac{n+1}{3}-\frac{g(g^2-1)}{12n(n-1)}$ if $g$ is odd. On the
other hand, we prove that mean distance is at least $\frac{ng}{4(n-1)}$ unless
$G$ is an odd cycle."
"In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm to compute various
parameters of a tree such as the process number, the edge search number or the
node search number and so the pathwidth. This algorithm requires n steps, an
overall computation time of O(n log(n)), and n messages of size log_3(n)+3. We
then propose a distributed algorithm to update the process number (or the node
search number, or the edge search number) of each component of a forest after
adding or deleting an edge. This second algorithm requires O(D) steps, an
overall computation time of O(D log(n)), and O(D) messages of size log_3(n)+3,
where D is the diameter of the modified connected component. Finally, we show
how to extend our algorithms to trees and forests of unknown size using
messages of less than 2a+4+e bits, where a is the parameter to be determined
and e=1 for updates algorithms."
"In his celebrated book ""On Number and Games"" (Academic Press, New-York,
1976), J.H. Conway introduced twelve versions of compound games. We analyze
these twelve versions for the Node-Kayles game on paths. For usual disjunctive
compound, Node-Kayles has been solved for a long time under normal play, while
it is still unsolved under mis\`ere play. We thus focus on the ten remaining
versions, leaving only one of them unsolved."
"The paper is devoted to a problem inspired by the ""Minesweeper"" computer
game. It is shown that certain configurations of open cells guarantee the
existence and the uniqueness of solution. Mathematically the problem is reduced
to some spectral properties of discrete differential operators. It is shown how
the uniqueness can be used to create a new game which preserves the spirit of
""Minesweeper"" but does not require a computer."
"In this paper the theory of Carry Value Transformation (CVT) is designed and
developed on a pair of n-bit strings and is used to produce many interesting
patterns. One of them is found to be a self-similar fractal whose dimension is
same as the dimension of the Sierpinski triangle. Different construction
procedures like L-system, Cellular Automata rule, Tilling for this fractal are
obtained which signifies that like other tools CVT can also be used for the
formation of self-similar fractals. It is shown that CVT can be used for the
production of periodic as well as chaotic patterns. Also, the analytical and
algebraic properties of CVT are discussed. The definition of CVT in
two-dimension is slightly modified and its mathematical properties are
highlighted. Finally, the extension of CVT and modified CVT (MCVT) are done in
higher dimensions."
"If $G$ is a bridgeless cubic graph, Fulkerson conjectured that we can find 6
perfect matchings $M_1,...,M_6$ of $G$ with the property that every edge of $G$
is contained in exactly two of them and Berge conjectured that its edge set can
be covered by 5 perfect matchings. We define $\tau(G)$ as the least number of
perfect matchings allowing to cover the edge set of a bridgeless cubic graph
and we study this parameter. The set of graphs with perfect matching index 4
seems interesting and we give some informations on this class."
"A permutation graph is an intersection graph of segments lying between two
parallel lines. A Seidel complementation of a finite graph at one of it vertex
$v$ consists to complement the edges between the neighborhood and the
non-neighborhood of $v$. Two graphs are Seidel complement equivalent if one can
be obtained from the other by a successive application of Seidel
complementation.
  In this paper we introduce the new concept of Seidel complementation and
Seidel minor, we then show that this operation preserves cographs and the
structure of modular decomposition. The main contribution of this paper is to
provide a new and succinct characterization of permutation graphs i.e. A graph
is a permutation graph \Iff it does not contain the following graphs: $C_5$,
$C_7$, $XF_{6}^{2}$, $XF_{5}^{2n+3}$, $C_{2n}, n\geqslant6$ and their
complement as Seidel minor. In addition we provide a $O(n+m)$-time algorithm to
output one of the forbidden Seidel minor if the graph is not a permutation
graph."
"The Rooted Maximum Leaf Outbranching problem consists in finding a spanning
directed tree rooted at some prescribed vertex of a digraph with the maximum
number of leaves. Its parameterized version asks if there exists such a tree
with at least $k$ leaves. We use the notion of $s-t$ numbering to exhibit
combinatorial bounds on the existence of spanning directed trees with many
leaves. These combinatorial bounds allow us to produce a constant factor
approximation algorithm for finding directed trees with many leaves, whereas
the best known approximation algorithm has a $\sqrt{OPT}$-factor. We also show
that Rooted Maximum Leaf Outbranching admits a quadratic kernel, improving over
the cubic kernel given by Fernau et al."
"Random instances of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP's) appear to be
hard for all known algorithms, when the number of constraints per variable lies
in a certain interval. Contributing to the general understanding of the
structure of the solution space of a CSP in the satisfiable regime, we
formulate a set of natural technical conditions on a large family of (random)
CSP's, and prove bounds on three most interesting thresholds for the density of
such an ensemble: namely, the satisfiability threshold, the threshold for
clustering of the solution space, and the threshold for an appropriate
reconstruction problem on the CSP's. The bounds become asymptoticlally tight as
the number of degrees of freedom in each clause diverges. The families are
general enough to include commonly studied problems such as, random instances
of Not-All-Equal-SAT, k-XOR formulae, hypergraph 2-coloring, and graph
k-coloring. An important new ingredient is a condition involving the Fourier
expansion of clauses, which characterizes the class of problems with a similar
threshold structure."
"We present and study in this paper a simple algorithm that produces so called
growing Parallel Random Apollonian Networks (P-RAN) in any dimension d.
Analytical derivations show that these networks still exhibit small-word and
scale-free characteristics. To characterize further the structure of P-RAN, we
introduce new parameters that we refer to as the parallel degree and the
parallel coefficient, that determine locally and in average the number of
vertices inside the (d+1)-cliques composing the network. We provide analytical
derivations for the computation of the degree and parallel degree
distributions, parallel and clustering coefficients. We give an upper bound for
the average path lengths for P-RAN and finally show that our derivations are in
very good agreement with our simulations."
"A graph homomorphism is a vertex map which carries edges from a source graph
to edges in a target graph. The instances of the Weighted Maximum H-Colourable
Subgraph problem (MAX H-COL) are edge-weighted graphs G and the objective is to
find a subgraph of G that has maximal total edge weight, under the condition
that the subgraph has a homomorphism to H; note that for H=K_k this problem is
equivalent to MAX k-CUT. Farnqvist et al. have introduced a parameter on the
space of graphs that allows close study of the approximability properties of
MAX H-COL. Specifically, it can be used to extend previously known
(in)approximability results to larger classes of graphs. Here, we investigate
the properties of this parameter on circular complete graphs K_{p/q}, where 2
<= p/q <= 3. The results are extended to K_4-minor-free graphs and graphs with
bounded maximum average degree. We also consider connections with Samal's work
on fractional covering by cuts: we address, and decide, two conjectures
concerning cubical chromatic numbers."
"We propose an exact method which combines the resolution search and branch &
bound algorithms for solving the 0?1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem. This
algorithm is able to prove large?scale strong correlated instances. The optimal
values of the 10 constraint, 500 variable instances of the OR-Library are
exposed. These values were previously unknown."
"We call a CNF formula linear if any two clauses have at most one variable in
common. We show that there exist unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formulas with at
most 4k^2 4^k clauses, and on the other hand, any linear k-CNF formula with at
most 4^k/(8e^2k^2) clauses is satisfiable. The upper bound uses probabilistic
means, and we have no explicit construction coming even close to it. One reason
for this is that unsatisfiable linear formulas exhibit a more complex structure
than general (non-linear) formulas: First, any treelike resolution refutation
of any unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formula has size at least 2^(2^(k/2-1))$.
This implies that small unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formulas are hard instances
for Davis-Putnam style splitting algorithms. Second, if we require that the
formula F have a strict resolution tree, i.e. every clause of F is used only
once in the resolution tree, then we need at least a^a^...^a clauses, where a
is approximately 2 and the height of this tower is roughly k."
"We consider the problem of periodic graph exploration in which a mobile
entity with constant memory, an agent, has to visit all n nodes of an arbitrary
undirected graph G in a periodic manner. Graphs are supposed to be anonymous,
that is, nodes are unlabeled. However, while visiting a node, the robot has to
distinguish between edges incident to it. For each node v the endpoints of the
edges incident to v are uniquely identified by different integer labels called
port numbers. We are interested in minimisation of the length of the
exploration period.
  This problem is unsolvable if the local port numbers are set arbitrarily.
However, surprisingly small periods can be achieved when assigning carefully
the local port numbers. Dobrev et al. described an algorithm for assigning port
numbers, and an oblivious agent (i.e. agent with no memory) using it, such that
the agent explores all graphs of size n within period 10n. Providing the agent
with a constant number of memory bits, the optimal length of the period was
previously proved to be no more than 3.75n (using a different assignment of the
port numbers). In this paper, we improve both these bounds. More precisely, we
show a period of length at most 4 1/3 n for oblivious agents, and a period of
length at most 3.5n for agents with constant memory. Moreover, we give the
first non-trivial lower bound, 2.8n, on the period length for the oblivious
case."
"This paper presents a classification of Cellular Automata rules based on its
properties at the nth iteration. Elaborate computer program has been designed
to get the nth iteration for arbitrary 1-D or 2-D CA rules. Studies indicate
that the figures at some particular iteration might be helpful for some
specific application. The hardware circuit implementation can be done using
opto-electronic components [1-7]."
"Consider a Markovian Petri net with race policy. The marking process has a
""product form"" stationary distribution if the probability of viewing a given
marking can be decomposed as the product over places of terms depending only on
the local marking. First we observe that the Deficiency Zero Theorem of
Feinberg, developped for chemical reaction networks, provides a structural and
simple sufficient condition for the existence of a product form. In view of
this, we study the classical subclass of free-choice nets. Roughly, we show
that the only such Petri nets having a product form are the state machines
which can alternatively be viewed as Jackson networks."
"A formal proof has not been found for the four color theorem since 1852 when
Francis Guthrie first conjectured the four color theorem. Why? A bad idea, we
think, directed people to a rough road. Using a similar method to that for the
formal proof of the five color theorem, a formal proof is proposed in this
paper of the four color theorem, namely, every planar graph is four-colorable.
The formal proof proposed can also be regarded as an algorithm to color a
planar graph using four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the
same color."
"The paper examines a partial order on bipartite graphs (X1, X2, E) with n
vertices, X1UX2={1,2,...,n}. This partial order is a natural partial order of
subobjects of an object in a triangular category with bipartite graphs as
morphisms."
"If $G$ is a bridgeless cubic graph, Fulkerson conjectured that we can find 6
perfect matchings (a{\em Fulkerson covering}) with the property that every edge
of $G$ is contained in exactly two of them. A consequence of the Fulkerson
conjecture would be that every bridgeless cubic graph has 3 perfect matchings
with empty intersection (this problem is known as the Fan Raspaud Conjecture).
A {\em FR-triple} is a set of 3 such perfect matchings. We show here how to
derive a Fulkerson covering from two FR-triples. Moreover, we give a simple
proof that the Fulkerson conjecture holds true for some classes of well known
snarks."
"The square $G^2$ of a graph $G$ is defined on the vertex set of $G$ in such a
way that distinct vertices with distance at most two in $G$ are joined by an
edge. We study the chromatic number of the square of the Cartesian product
$C_m\Box C_n$ of two cycles and show that the value of this parameter is at
most 7 except when $m=n=3$, in which case the value is 9, and when $m=n=4$ or
$m=3$ and $n=5$, in which case the value is 8. Moreover, we conjecture that
whenever $G=C_m\Box C_n$, the chromatic number of $G^2$ equals $\lceil
mn/\alpha(G^2) \rceil$, where $\alpha(G^2)$ denotes the size of a maximal
independent set in $G^2$."
"This paper presents new results about digital straight segments, their
recognition and related properties. They come from the study of the
arithmetically based recognition algorithm proposed by I. Debled-Rennesson and
J.-P. Reveill\`es in 1995 [Debled95]. We indeed exhibit the relations
describing the possible changes in the parameters of the digital straight
segment under investigation. This description is achieved by considering new
parameters on digital segments: instead of their arithmetic description, we
examine the parameters related to their combinatoric description. As a result
we have a better understanding of their evolution during recognition and
analytical formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be
projected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have interesting
consequences on the geometry of digital curves. We show how they can for
instance be used to bound the slope difference between consecutive maximal
segments."
"We review the concept of the number wall as an alternative to the traditional
linear complexity profile (LCP), and sketch the relationship to other topics
such as linear feedback shift-register (LFSR) and context-free Lindenmayer
(D0L) sequences. A remarkable ternary analogue of the Thue-Morse sequence is
introduced having deficiency 2 modulo 3, and this property verified via the
re-interpretation of the number wall as an aperiodic plane tiling."
"The first two authors have shown [KK99,KK00] that the sum the exponent (and
thus the number) of maximal repetitions of exponent at least 2 (also called
runs) is linear in the length of the word. The exponent 2 in the definition of
a run may seem arbitrary. In this paper, we consider maximal repetitions of
exponent strictly greater than 1."
"The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle. We give an
algorithm that computes in O(n(log n)^3) time and O(n) space the (weighted)
girth of an n-vertex planar digraph with arbitrary real edge weights. This is
an improvement of a previous time bound of O(n^(3/2)), a bound which was only
valid for non-negative edge-weights. Our algorithm can be modified to output a
shortest cycle within the same time and space bounds if such a cycle exists."
"An $acyclic$ edge coloring of a graph is a proper edge coloring such that
there are no bichromatic cycles. The \emph{acyclic chromatic index} of a graph
is the minimum number k such that there is an acyclic edge coloring using k
colors and is denoted by $a'(G)$. It was conjectured by Alon, Sudakov and Zaks
(and much earlier by Fiamcik) that $a'(G)\le \Delta+2$, where $\Delta
=\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of the graph. We prove that if $G$ is a
planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, then $a'(G)\le \Delta + 12$."
"We study the cycles generated by the chip firing game associated with n-cube
orientations. We show the existence of the cycles generated by parallel
evolutions of even lengths from 2 to $2^n$ on $H_n$ (n >= 1), and of odd
lengths different from 3 and ranging from 1 to $2^{n-1}-1$ on $H_n$ (n >= 4)."
"We proved that for every $n\geq 3$, the $n$-dimensional tarai function
terminates with call-by-need. It was also shown that the closed form for the
function suggested by T. Bailey and J. Cowles is correct."
"We introduce a new class of functions that can be minimized in polynomial
time in the value oracle model. These are functions $f$ satisfying
$f(x)+f(y)\ge f(x \sqcap y)+f(x \sqcup y)$ where the domain of each variable
$x_i$ corresponds to nodes of a rooted binary tree, and operations
$\sqcap,\sqcup$ are defined with respect to this tree. Special cases include
previously studied $L^\natural$-convex and bisubmodular functions, which can be
obtained with particular choices of trees. We present a polynomial-time
algorithm for minimizing functions in the new class. It combines Murota's
steepest descent algorithm for $L^\natural$-convex functions with bisubmodular
minimization algorithms."
"It is proven that the connected pathwidth of any graph $G$ is at most
$2\cdot\pw(G)+1$, where $\pw(G)$ is the pathwidth of $G$. The method is
constructive, i.e. it yields an efficient algorithm that for a given path
decomposition of width $k$ computes a connected path decomposition of width at
most $2k+1$. The running time of the algorithm is $O(dk^2)$, where $d$ is the
number of `bags' in the input path decomposition.
  The motivation for studying connected path decompositions comes from the
connection between the pathwidth and the search number of a graph. One of the
advantages of the above bound for connected pathwidth is an inequality
$\csn(G)\leq 2\sn(G)+3$, where $\csn(G)$ and $\sn(G)$ are the connected search
number and the search number of $G$. Moreover, the algorithm presented in this
work can be used to convert a given search strategy using $k$ searchers into a
(monotone) connected one using $2k+3$ searchers and starting at an arbitrary
homebase."
"The independence number of a sparse random graph G(n,m) of average degree
d=2m/n is well-known to be \alpha(G(n,m))~2n ln(d)/d with high probability.
Moreover, a trivial greedy algorithm w.h.p. finds an independent set of size
(1+o(1)) n ln(d)/d, i.e. half the maximum size. Yet in spite of 30 years of
extensive research no efficient algorithm has emerged to produce an independent
set with (1+c)n ln(d)/d, for any fixed c>0. In this paper we prove that the
combinatorial structure of the independent set problem in random graphs
undergoes a phase transition as the size k of the independent sets passes the
point k nln(d)/d. Roughly speaking, we prove that independent sets of size
k>(1+c)n ln(d)/d form an intricately ragged landscape, in which local search
algorithms are bound to get stuck. We illustrate this phenomenon by providing
an exponential lower bound for the Metropolis process, a Markov chain for
sampling independents sets."
"An edge-coloring of a graph $G$ with colors $1,2,\ldots,t$ is called an
interval $t$-coloring if for each $i\in \{1,2,\ldots,t\}$ there is at least one
edge of $G$ colored by $i$, and the colors of edges incident to any vertex of
$G$ are distinct and form an interval of integers. In this paper we prove that
if a connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices admits an interval $t$-coloring,
then $t\leq 2n-3$. We also show that if $G$ is a connected $r$-regular graph
with $n$ vertices has an interval $t$-coloring and $n\geq 2r+2$, then this
upper bound can be improved to $2n-5$."
"An $acyclic$ edge coloring of a graph is a proper edge coloring such that
there are no bichromatic cycles. The \emph{acyclic chromatic index} of a graph
is the minimum number k such that there is an acyclic edge coloring using k
colors and is denoted by $a'(G)$. It was conjectured by Alon, Sudakov and Zaks
(and much earlier by Fiamcik) that $a'(G)\le \Delta+2$, where $\Delta
=\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of the graph.
  If every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ satisfies the condition $\vert E(H)
\vert \le 2\vert V(H) \vert -1$, we say that the graph $G$ satisfies $Property\
A$. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ satisfies $Property\ A$, then $a'(G)\le
\Delta + 3$. Triangle free planar graphs satisfy $Property\ A$. We infer that
$a'(G)\le \Delta + 3$, if $G$ is a triangle free planar graph. Another class of
graph which satisfies $Property\ A$ is 2-fold graphs (union of two forests)."
"Given a planar undirected n-vertex graph G with non-negative edge weights, we
show how to compute, for given vertices s and t in G, a min st-cut in G in O(n
loglog n) time and O(n) space. The previous best time bound was O(n log n)."
"The knapsack problem (KP) and its multidimensional version (MKP) are basic
problems in combinatorial optimization. In this paper we consider their
multiobjective extension (MOKP and MOMKP), for which the aim is to obtain or to
approximate the set of efficient solutions. In a first step, we classify and
describe briefly the existing works, that are essentially based on the use of
metaheuristics. In a second step, we propose the adaptation of the two-phase
Pareto local search (2PPLS) to the resolution of the MOMKP. With this aim, we
use a very-large scale neighborhood (VLSN) in the second phase of the method,
that is the Pareto local search. We compare our results to state-of-the-art
results and we show that we obtain results never reached before by heuristics,
for the biobjective instances. Finally we consider the extension to
three-objective instances."
"This paper formalizes the optimal base problem, presents an algorithm to
solve it, and describes its application to the encoding of Pseudo-Boolean
constraints to SAT. We demonstrate the impact of integrating our algorithm
within the Pseudo-Boolean constraint solver MINISAT+. Experimentation indicates
that our algorithm scales to bases involving numbers up to 1,000,000, improving
on the restriction in MINISAT+ to prime numbers up to 17. We show that, while
for many examples primes up to 17 do suffice, encoding with respect to optimal
bases reduces the CNF sizes and improves the subsequent SAT solving time for
many examples."
"Let $H$ be a fixed graph and let $G$ be an $H$-minor free $n$-vertex graph
with integer edge weights and no negative weight cycles reachable from a given
vertex $s$. We present an algorithm that computes a shortest path tree in $G$
rooted at $s$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3}\log L)$ time, where $L$ is the absolute
value of the smallest edge weight. The previous best bound was
$\tilde{O}(n^{\sqrt{11.5}-2}\log L) = O(n^{1.392}\log L)$. Our running time
matches an earlier bound for planar graphs by Henzinger et al."
"An overlap representation is an assignment of sets to the vertices of a graph
in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the sets assigned
to them overlap. The overlap number of a graph is the minimum number of
elements needed to form such a representation. We find the overlap numbers of
cliques and complete bipartite graphs by relating the problem to previous
research in combinatorics. The overlap numbers of paths, cycles, and
caterpillars are also established. Finally, we show the NP-completeness of the
problems of extending an overlap representation and finding a minimum overlap
representation with limited containment."
"Solving fastest mixing Markov chain problem (i.e. finding transition
probabilities on the edges to minimize the second largest eigenvalue modulus of
the transition probability matrix) over networks with different topologies is
one of the primary areas of research in the context of computer science and one
of the well known networks in this issue is K-partite network. Here in this
work we present analytical solution for the problem of fastest mixing Markov
chain by means of stratification and semidefinite programming, for four
particular types of K-partite networks, namely Symmetric K-PPDR, Semi Symmetric
K-PPDR, Cycle K-PPDR and Semi Cycle K-PPDR networks. Our method in this paper
is based on convexity of fastest mixing Markov chain problem, and inductive
comparing of the characteristic polynomials initiated by slackness conditions
in order to find the optimal transition probabilities. The presented results
shows that a Symmetric K-PPDR network and its equivalent Semi Symmetric K-PPDR
network have the same SLEM despite the fact that Semi symmetric K-PPDR network
has less edges than its equivalent symmetric K-PPDR network and at the same
time symmetric K-PPDR network has better mixing rate per step than its
equivalent semi symmetric K-PPDR network at first few iterations. The same
results are true for Cycle K-PPDR and Semi Cycle K-PPDR networks. Also the
obtained optimal transition probabilities have been compared with the
transition probabilities obtained from Metropolis-Hasting method by comparing
mixing time improvements numerically."
"For natural numbers $n$ and $k$ ($n > 2k$), a generalized Petersen graph
$P(n,k)$, is defined by vertex set $\lbrace u_i,v_i\rbrace$ and edge set
$\lbrace u_iu_{i+1},u_iv_i,v_iv_{i+k}\rbrace$; where $i = 1,2,\dots,n$ and
subscripts are reduced modulo $n$. Here first, we characterize minimum vertex
covers in generalized Petersen graphs. Second, we present a lower bound and
some upper bounds for $\beta(P(n,k))$, the size of minimum vertex cover of
$P(n,k)$. Third, in some cases, we determine the exact values of
$\beta(P(n,k))$. Our conjecture is that $\beta(P(n,k)) \le n +
\lceil\frac{n}{5}\rceil$, for all $n$ and $k$."
"Let $\gamma'_s(G)$ be the signed edge domination number of G. In 2006, Xu
conjectured that: for any $2$-connected graph G of order $ n (n \geq 2),$
$\gamma'_s(G)\geq 1$. In this article we show that this conjecture is not true.
More precisely, we show that for any positive integer $m$, there exists an
$m$-connected graph $G$ such that $ \gamma'_s(G)\leq -\frac{m}{6}|V(G)|.$ Also
for every two natural numbers $m$ and $n$, we determine $\gamma'_s(K_{m,n})$,
where $K_{m,n}$ is the complete bipartite graph with part sizes $m$ and $n$."
"We give an algorithm with complexity $O(f(R)^{k^2} k^3 n)$ for the integer
multiflow problem on instances $(G,H,r,c)$ with $G$ an acyclic planar digraph
and $r+c$ Eulerian. Here, $f$ is a polynomial function, $n = |V(G)|$, $k =
|E(H)|$ and $R$ is the maximum request $\max_{h \in E(H)} r(h)$. When $k$ is
fixed, this gives a polynomial algorithm for the arc-disjoint paths problem
under the same hypothesis."
"We give an algorithm to route a multicommodity flow in a planar graph $G$
with congestion $O(\log k)$, where $k$ is the maximum number of terminals on
the boundary of a face, when each demand edge lie on a face of $G$. We also
show that our specific method cannot achieve a substantially better congestion."
"We present a new sufficient condition on stability number and toughness of
the graph to have an f-factor."
"Consider the following cascading process on a simple undirected graph
$G(V,E)$ with diameter $\Delta$. In round zero, a set $S\subseteq V$ of
vertices, called the seeds, are active. In round $i+1,$ $i\in\mathbb{N},$ a
non-isolated vertex is activated if at least a $\rho\in(\,0,1\,]$ fraction of
its neighbors are active in round $i$; it is deactivated otherwise. For
$k\in\mathbb{N},$ let $\text{min-seed}^{(k)}(G,\rho)$ be the minimum number of
seeds needed to activate all vertices in or before round $k$. This paper
derives upper bounds on $\text{min-seed}^{(k)}(G,\rho)$. In particular, if $G$
is connected and there exist constants $C>0$ and $\gamma>2$ such that the
fraction of degree-$k$ vertices in $G$ is at most $C/k^\gamma$ for all
$k\in\mathbb{Z}^+,$ then
$\text{min-seed}^{(\Delta)}(G,\rho)=O(\lceil\rho^{\gamma-1}\,|\,V\,|\rceil)$.
Furthermore, for $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,$ $p=\Omega((\ln{(e/\rho)})/(\rho n))$ and
with probability $1-\exp{(-n^{\Omega(1)})}$ over the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random
graphs $G(n,p),$ $\text{min-seed}^{(1)}(G(n,p),\rho)=O(\rho n)$."
"We provide proofs of the following theorems by considering the entropy of
random walks: Theorem 1.(Alon, Hoory and Linial) Let G be an undirected simple
graph with n vertices, girth g, minimum degree at least 2 and average degree d:
Odd girth: If g=2r+1,then n \geq 1 + d*(\Sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(d-1)^i) Even girth: If
g=2r,then n \geq 2*(\Sum_{i=0}^{r-1} (d-1)^i) Theorem 2.(Hoory) Let G =
(V_L,V_R,E) be a bipartite graph of girth g = 2r, with n_L = |V_L| and n_R =
|V_R|, minimum degree at least 2 and the left and right average degrees d_L and
d_R. Then, n_L \geq \Sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(d_R-1)^{i/2}(d_L-1)^{i/2} n_R \geq
\Sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(d_L-1)^{i/2}(d_R-1)^{i/2}"
"A Catalan pair is a pair of binary relations (S,R) satisfying certain axioms.
These objects are enumerated by the well-known Catalan numbers, and have been
introduced with the aim of giving a common language to most of the structures
counted by Catalan numbers. Here, we give a simple method to pass from the
recursive definition of a generic Catalan structure to the recursive definition
of the Catalan pair on the same structure, thus giving an automatic way to
interpret Catalan structures in terms of Catalan pairs. We apply our method to
many well-known Catalan structures, focusing on the meaning of the relations S
and R in each considered case."
"A D2CS of a graph G is a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $diam(G[S]) \leq 2$. We
study the problem of counting and enumerating D2CS of a graph. First we give an
explicit formula for the number of D2CS in a complete k-ary tree, Fibonacci
tree, binary Fibonacci tree and the binomial tree. Next we give an algorithm
for enumerating and counting D2CS of a graph. We then give a linear time
algorithm for finding all maximal D2CS in a strongly chordal graph."
"For integers r and k > 0(k>r),a conditional (k, r)-coloring of a graph G is a
proper k-coloring of G such that every vertex v of G has at least min{r,d(v)}
differently colored neighbors, where d(v) is the degree of v. In this note, for
different values of r we obtain the conditional chromatic number of a grid
$G(2,n) \cong P_2 \ \Box \ P_n$, $C_n^2$ and the strong product of $P_n$ and
$P_m$ (n,m being positive integers). Also, for integers $n \geq 3$ and $t \geq
1$ the second order conditional chromatic number (also known as dynamic
chromatic number) of the (t,n)-web graph is obtained."
"Ziv-Lempel and Crochemore factorization are two kinds of factorizations of
words related to text processing. In this paper, we find these factorizations
for standard epiesturmian words. Thus the previously known c-factorization of
standard Sturmian words is provided as a special case. Moreover, the two
factorizations are compared."
"A set S of n points is 2-color universal for a graph G on n vertices if for
every proper 2-coloring of G and for every 2-coloring of S with the same sizes
of color classes as G has, G is straight-line embeddable on S. We show that the
so-called double chain is 2-color universal for paths if each of the two chains
contains at least one fifth of all the points, but not if one of the chains is
more than approximately 28 times longer than the other. A 2-coloring of G is
equitable if the sizes of the color classes differ by at most 1. A bipartite
graph is equitable if it admits an equitable proper coloring. We study the case
when S is the double-chain with chain sizes differing by at most 1 and G is an
equitable bipartite graph. We prove that this S is not 2-color universal if G
is not a forest of caterpillars and that it is 2-color universal for equitable
caterpillars with at most one half non-leaf vertices. We also show that if this
S is equitably 2-colored, then equitably properly 2-colored forests of stars
can be embedded on it."
"In this paper, we prove that given any \Pi^0_1 subset $P$ of $\{0,1\}^\NN$
there is a tileset $\tau$ with a set of configurations $C$ such that
$P\times\ZZ^2$ is recursively homeomorphic to $C\setminus U$ where $U$ is a
computable set of configurations. As a consequence, if $P$ is countable, this
tileset has the exact same set of Turing degrees."
"In a well-known paper[ARV], Arora, Rao and Vazirani obtained an O(sqrt(log
n)) approximation to the Balanced Separator problem and Uniform Sparsest Cut.
At the heart of their result is a geometric statement about sets of points that
satisfy triangle inequalities, which also underlies subsequent work on
approximation algorithms and geometric embeddings.
  In this note, we give an equivalent formulation of the Structure theorem in
[ARV] in terms of the expansion of large sets in geometric graphs on sets of
points satisfying triangle inequalities."
"The generalized Tower of Hanoi problem with h \ge 4 pegs is known to require
a sub-exponentially fast growing number of moves in order to transfer a pile of
n disks from one peg to another. In this paper we study the Path_h variant,
where the pegs are placed along a line, and disks can be moved from a peg to
its nearest neighbor(s) only.
  Whereas in the simple variant there are h(h-1)/2 possible bi-directional
interconnections among pegs, here there are only h-1 of them. Despite the
significant reduction in the number of interconnections, the number of moves
needed to transfer a pile of n disks between any two pegs also grows
sub-exponentially as a function of n.
  We study these graphs, identify sets of mutually recursive tasks, and obtain
a relatively tight upper bound for the number of moves, depending on h, n and
the source and destination pegs."
"In this paper, we conclude the calculation of the domination number of all
$n\times m$ grid graphs. Indeed, we prove Chang's conjecture saying that for
every $16\le n\le m$, $\gamma(G_{n,m})=\lfloor\frac{(n+2)(m+2)}{5}\rfloor -4$."
"In a graph $G$ of maximum degree 3, let $\gamma(G)$ denote the largest
fraction of edges that can be 3 edge-coloured. Rizzi \cite{Riz09} showed that
$\gamma(G) \geq 1-\frac{2\strut}{\strut 3 g_{odd}(G)}$ where $g_{odd}(G)$ is
the odd girth of $G$, when $G$ is triangle-free. In \cite{FouVan10a} we
extended that result to graph with maximum degree 3. We show here that
$\gamma(G) \geq 1-\frac{2 \strut}{\strut 3 g_{odd}(G)+2}$, which leads to
$\gamma(G) \geq 15/17$ when considering graphs with odd girth at least 5,
distinct from the Petersen graph."
"Reed conjectured that for any graph $G$, $\chi(G) \leq \lceil
\frac{\omega(G)+\Delta(G)+1}{2}\rceil$, where $\chi(G)$, $\omega(G)$, and
$\Delta(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number, the clique number and the
maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we verify this conjecture for some
special classes of graphs, in particular for subclasses of $P_5$-free graphs or
$Chair$-free graphs."
"In 1998, Reed conjectured that for any graph $G$, $\chi(G) \leq \lceil
\frac{\omega(G) + \Delta(G)+1}{2}\rceil$, where $\chi(G)$, $\omega(G)$, and
$\Delta(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number, the clique number and the
maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we study this conjecture for some
expansions of graphs, that is graphs obtained with the well known operation
composition of graphs.
  We prove that Reed's Conjecture holds for expansions of bipartite graphs, for
expansions of odd holes where the minimum chromatic number of the components is
even, when some component of the expansion has chromatic number 1 or when a
component induces a bipartite graph. Moreover, Reed's Conjecture holds if all
components have the same chromatic number, if the components have chromatic
number at most 4 and when the odd hole has length 5. Finally, when $G$ is an
odd hole expansion, we prove
$\chi(G)\leq\lceil\frac{\omega(G)+\Delta(G)+1}{2}\rceil+1$."
"The 3x+1 problem is one of the most classical problems in computer science,
related to many fields. As it is thought by scientists a highly hard problem,
resolving it successfully not only can improve the research in many relating
fields, but also be meaningful to the method study. By deep analyzing the 3x+1
calculation process with the input positive integer becoming greater, we find a
useful way for solving this problem with high probability. By making use of the
greater calculating ability of great computers and the internet, our way is a
valid and powerful way for utterly solving the 3x+1 problem. This way can be
expressed in three points: 1) If we can find a positive integer N, for any
positive integer less than 2N, the times of dividing 2 out of its stopping time
is less than or equal to N, then the 3x+1 conjecture is true; 2) This N may be
big, so the calculation may be too big. Our way for solving this is: to find a
positive integer K, for all positive integers less than 2K, not all the times
of dividing 2 out of their stopping time for these integers are less than or
equal to K, some part of these are greater than K, but the number of this part
becomes less and less with the K increasing; 3) This K and the calculation may
also be too big, our way for solving this is: to find a positive integer R, for
all positive integers less than 2R, as above, out of their stopping time, the
times of dividing 2 of some part of these integers are greater than R, also the
number of this part integers does not become less immediately with the R
increasing, but the increasing rate of this number is less and less until to
below zero."
"We define the Cartesian product, composition, union and join on
interval-valued fuzzy graphs and investigate some of their properties. We also
introduce the notion of interval-valued fuzzy complete graphs and present some
properties of self complementary and self weak complementary interval-valued
fuzzy complete graphs."
"It is well-known that the class of lattices generated by Chip Firing games
(CFGs) is strictly included in the class of upper locally distributive lattices
(ULD). However a necessary and sufficient criterion for this class is still an
open question. In this paper we settle this problem by giving such a criterion.
This criterion provides a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a CFG
which generates a given lattice if such a CFG exists. Going further we solve
the same problem on two other classes of lattices which are generated by CFGs
on the classes of undirected graphs and directed acyclic graphs."
"Transcription factors are short stretches of DNA (or $k$-mers) mainly located
in promoters sequences that enhance or repress gene expression. With respect to
an initial distribution of letters on the DNA alphabet, Behrens and Vingron
consider a random sequence of length $n$ that does not contain a given $k$-mer
or word of size $k$. Under an evolution model of the DNA, they compute the
probability $\mathfrak{p}_n$ that this $k$-mer appears after a unit time of 20
years. They prove that the waiting time for the first apparition of the $k$-mer
is well approximated by $T_n=1/\mathfrak{p}_n$. Their work relies on the
simplifying assumption that the $k$-mer is not self-overlapping. They observe
in particular that the waiting time is mostly driven by the initial
distribution of letters.
  Behrens et al. use an approach by automata that relaxes the assumption
related to words overlaps. Their numerical evaluations confirms the validity of
Behrens and Vingron approach for non self-overlapping words, but provides up to
44% corrections for highly self-overlapping words such as $\mathtt{AAAAA}$. We
devised an approach of the problem by clump analysis and generating functions;
this approach leads to prove a quasi-linear behaviour of $\mathfrak{p}_n$ for a
large range of values of $n$, an important result for DNA evolution. We present
here this clump analysis, first by language decomposition, and next by an
automaton construction; finally, we describe an equivalent approach by
construction of Markov automata."
"Based on the numerical representations by T basic vectors of a symbolic
sequence consisting of T symbols, first, we prove mathematical that the total
Fourier spectrum of the sequence is the square of the length of the sequence.
In the meantime, we define the indicator sequences vector. Using the orthogonal
or row orthogonal transformations of the indicator sequences vector, we
construct some special numerical representations of the symbolic sequence and
characterize the signal-to-noise ratios of the power spectrum of the numerical
representations. After calculating the discrete Fourier transform of those
special numerical representations, the signal-to-noise ratios of them can be
figured out. Mathematical theorems prove that the signal-to-noise ratio of the
Fourier spectrum of those special representations of the symbolic sequence is
T/(T-1) times the signal-to-noise ratio of the representation by T base
vectors. The results are applied in analyzing the properties of the DNA
sequences or protein sequences in the frequency domain, if one uses the
signal-to-noise ratios of special representations as the distinguishing
criterion, the distinguishing results only depend upon the distribution of the
symbols in the symbolic sequence and their mathematical constructions of
representations, but do not relate to the chemical or biological meanings of
the representations."
"Consider a random $k$-CNF formula $F_{k}(n, rn)$ with $n$ variables and $rn$
clauses. For every truth assignment $\sigma\in \{0, 1\}^{n}$ and every clause
$c=\ell_{1}\vee\cdots\vee\ell_{k}$, let $d=d(\sigma, c)$ be the number of
satisfied literal occurrences in $c$ under $\sigma$. For fixed $\beta>-1$ and
$\lambda>0$, we take $\omega(\sigma, c)=0$, if $d=0$; $\omega(\sigma,
c)=\lambda(1+\beta)$, if $d=1$ and $\omega(\sigma, c)=\lambda^{d}$, if $d>1$.
  Applying the above weighting scheme, we get that if $F_{k}(n, rn)$ is
unsatisfiable with probability tending to one as $n\rightarrow\infty$, then
$r\geq2.83, 8.09, 18.91, 40.81, 84.87$ for $k=3, 4, 5, 6$ and $7,$
respectively."
"We investigate the computation of mappings from a set S^n to itself with ""in
situ programs"", that is using no extra variables than the input, and performing
modifications of one component at a time, hence using no memory. In this paper,
we survey this problem introduced in previous papers by the authors, we detail
its close relation with rearrangeable multicast networks, and we provide new
results for both viewpoints.
  A bijective mapping can be computed by 2n - 1 component modifications, that
is by a program of length 2n - 1, a result equivalent to the rearrangeability
of the concatenation of two reversed butterfly networks. For a general
arbitrary mapping, we give two methods to build a program with maximal length
4n-3. Equivalently, this yields rearrangeable multicast routing methods for the
network formed by four successive butterflies with alternating reversions. The
first method is available for any set S and practically equivalent to a known
method in network theory. The second method, a refinement of the first,
described when |S| is a power of 2, is new and allows more flexibility than the
known method.
  For a linear mapping, when S is any field, or a quotient of an Euclidean
domain (e.g. Z/sZ for any integer s), we build a program with maximal length 2n
- 1. In this case the assignments are also linear, thereby particularly
efficient from the algorithmic viewpoint, and giving moreover directly a
program for the inverse when it exists. This yields also a new result on matrix
decompositions, and a new result on the multicast properties of two successive
reversed butterflies. Results of this flavour were known only for the boolean
field Z/2Z."
"The maximum stable set problem is NP-hard, even when restricted to
triangle-free graphs. In particular, one cannot expect a polynomial time
algorithm deciding if a bull-free graph has a stable set of size $k$, when $k$
is part of the instance. Our main result in this paper is to show the existence
of an FPT algorithm when we parameterize the problem by the solution size $k$.
A polynomial kernel is unlikely to exist for this problem. We show however that
our problem has a polynomial size Turing-kernel. More precisely, the hard cases
are instances of size $O(k^5)$. As a byproduct, if we forbid odd holes in
addition to the bull, we show the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for
the stable set problem. We also prove that the chromatic number of a bull-free
graph is bounded by a function of its clique number and the maximum chromatic
number of its triangle-free induced subgraphs. All our results rely on a
decomposition theorem of bull-free graphs due to Chudnovsky which is modified
here, allowing us to provide extreme decompositions, adapted to our
computational purpose."
"We consider discrete pairwise energy minimization problem (weighted
constraint satisfaction, max-sum labeling) and methods that identify a globally
optimal partial assignment of variables. When finding a complete optimal
assignment is intractable, determining optimal values for a part of variables
is an interesting possibility. Existing methods are based on different
sufficient conditions. We propose a new sufficient condition for partial
optimality which is: (1) verifiable in polynomial time (2) invariant to
reparametrization of the problem and permutation of labels and (3) includes
many existing sufficient conditions as special cases. We pose the problem of
finding the maximum optimal partial assignment identifiable by the new
sufficient condition. A polynomial method is proposed which is guaranteed to
assign same or larger part of variables than several existing approaches. The
core of the method is a specially constructed linear program that identifies
persistent assignments in an arbitrary multi-label setting."
"We prove that Broder's Markov chain for approximate sampling near-perfect and
perfect matchings is not rapidly mixing for Hamiltonian, regular, threshold and
planar bipartite graphs, filling a gap in the literature. In the second part we
experimentally compare Broder's chain with the Markov chain by Jerrum, Sinclair
and Vigoda from 2004. For the first time, we provide a systematic experimental
investigation of mixing time bounds for these Markov chains. We observe that
the exact total mixing time is in many cases significantly lower than known
upper bounds using canonical path or multicommodity flow methods, even if the
structure of an underlying state graph is known. In contrast we observe
comparatively tighter upper bounds using spectral gaps."
"Intersection graphs are very important in both theoretical as well as
application point of view. Depending on the geometrical representation,
different type of intersection graphs are defined. Among them interval,
circular-arc, permutation, trapezoid, chordal, disk, circle graphs are more
important. In this article, a brief introduction of each of these intersection
graphs is given. Some basic properties and algorithmic status of few problems
on these graphs are cited. This article will help to the beginners to start
work in this direction. Since the article contains a lot of information in a
compact form it is also useful for the expert researchers too."
"A matching in a graph is a set of edges no two of which share a common
vertex. A matching M is an induced matching if no edge connects two edges of M.
The problem of finding a maximum induced matching is known to be NP-hard in
general and specifically for bipartite graphs. Lozin has been proposed an
O(n^3) time algorithm for this problem on the class of bipartite
Star_123,Sun_4-free graphs. In this paper we improve and generalize this result
in presenting a simple O(n) time algorithm for maximum induced matching problem
in bipartite Star_123-free graphs."
"In this paper, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy matrix (IVIFM) is
introduced. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy determinant is also
defined. Some fundamental operations are also presented. The need of IVIFM is
explain by an example."
"Heuristic Rating Estimation (HRE) is a newly proposed method supporting
decisions analysis based on the use of pairwise comparisons. It allows that the
ranking values of some alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) are
initially known, whilst the ranks for the other concepts have yet to be
estimated. To calculate the missing ranks it is assumed that the priority of
every single concept can be determined as the weighted arithmetic mean of
priorities of all the other concepts. It has been shown that the problem has
admissible solution if the inconsistency of pairwise comparisons is not too
high. The proposed approach adopts the heuristics according to which to
determine the missing priorities a weighted geometric mean is used. In this
approach, despite an increased complexity, the solution always exists and their
existence does not depend on the inconsistency of the input matrix. Thus, the
presented approach might be appropriate for a larger number of problems than
the previous method. The formal definition of the proposed geometric heuristics
is accompanied by two numerical examples."
"Drawings of non-planar graphs always result in edge crossings. When there are
many edges crossing at small angles, it is often difficult to follow these
edges, because of the multiple visual paths resulted from the crossings that
slow down eye movements. In this paper we propose an algorithm that
disambiguates the edges with automatic selection of distinctive colors. Our
proposed algorithm computes a near optimal color assignment of a dual collision
graph, using a novel branch-and-bound procedure applied to a space
decomposition of the color gamut. We give examples demonstrating the
effectiveness of this approach in clarifying drawings of real world graphs and
maps."
"We design an $O(n^3)$ algorithm to find a minimum weighted coloring of a
($P_5, \bar{P}_5$)-free graph. Furthermore, the same technique can be used to
solve the same problem for several classes of graphs, defined by forbidden
induced subgraphs, such as (diamond, co-diamond)-free graphs."
"Patterned self-assembly tile set synthesis (PATS) aims at finding a minimum
tile set to uniquely self-assemble a given rectangular (color) pattern. For k
>= 1, k-PATS is a variant of PATS that restricts input patterns to those with
at most $k$ colors. A computer-assisted proof has been recently proposed for
2-PATS by Kari et al. [arXiv:1404.0967 (2014)]. In contrast, the best known
manually-checkable proof is for the NP-hardness of 29-PATS by Johnsen, Kao, and
Seki [ISAAC 2013, LNCS 8283, pp.~699-710]. We propose a manually-checkable
proof for the NP-hardness of 11-PATS."
"The Wiener index is one of the oldest graph parameter which is used to study
molecular-graph-based structure. This parameter was first proposed by Harold
Wiener in 1947 to determining the boiling point of paraffin. The Wiener index
of a molecular graph measures the compactness of the underlying molecule. This
parameter is wide studied area for molecular chemistry. It is used to study the
physio-chemical properties of the underlying organic compounds. The Wiener
index of a connected graph is denoted by W(G) and is defined as, that is W(G)
is the sum of distances between all pairs (ordered) of vertices of G. In this
paper, we give the algorithmic idea to find the Wiener index of some graphs,
like cactus graphs and intersection graphs, viz. interval, circular-arc,
permutation, trapezoid graphs."
"Given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and two positive integers $d,k \in \mathbb{N}$,
the ($d,kn$)-differential coloring problem asks for a coloring of the vertices
of $G$ (if one exists) with distinct numbers from 1 to $kn$ (treated as
\emph{colors}), such that the minimum difference between the two colors of any
adjacent vertices is at least $d$. While it was known that the problem of
determining whether a general graph is ($2,n$)-differential colorable is
NP-complete, our main contribution is a complete characterization of bipartite,
planar and outerplanar graphs that admit ($2,kn$)-differential colorings. For
practical reasons, we consider also color ranges larger than $n$, i.e., $k >
1$. We show that it is NP-complete to determine whether a graph admits a
($3,2n$)-differential coloring. The same negative result holds for the
($\lfloor 2n/3 \rfloor, 2n$-differential coloring problem, even in the case
where the input graph is planar."
"We propose a new ternary infinite (even full-infinite) square-free sequence.
The sequence is defined both by an iterative method and by a direct definition.
Both definitions are analogous to those of the Thue-Morse sequence. The direct
definition is given by a deterministic finite automaton with output. In short,
the sequence is automatic."
"An upper bound for the number of Hamiltonian cycles of symmetric diagraphs is
established first in this paper, which is tighter than the famous Minc's bound
and the Br$\acute{e}$gman's bound. A transformation on graphs is proposed, so
that counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles of an undirected graph can be
done by counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles of its corresponding
symmetric directed graph. In this way, an upper bound for the number of
Hamiltonian cycles of undirected graphs is also obtained."
"For digraphs $G$ and $H$, a homomorphism of $G$ to $H$ is a mapping $f:\
V(G)\dom V(H)$ such that $uv\in A(G)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H)$. If, moreover,
each vertex $u \in V(G)$ is associated with costs $c_i(u), i \in V(H)$, then
the cost of a homomorphism $f$ is $\sum_{u\in V(G)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. For each fixed
digraph $H$, the minimum cost homomorphism problem for $H$, denoted
MinHOM($H$), can be formulated as follows: Given an input digraph $G$, together
with costs $c_i(u)$, $u\in V(G)$, $i\in V(H)$, decide whether there exists a
homomorphism of $G$ to $H$ and, if one exists, to find one of minimum cost.
Minimum cost homomorphism problems encompass (or are related to) many well
studied optimization problems such as the minimum cost chromatic partition and
repair analysis problems. We focus on the minimum cost homomorphism problem for
locally semicomplete digraphs and quasi-transitive digraphs which are two
well-known generalizations of tournaments. Using graph-theoretic
characterization results for the two digraph classes, we obtain a full
dichotomy classification of the complexity of minimum cost homomorphism
problems for both classes."
"For a given graph consider a pair of disjoint matchings the union of which
contains as many edges as possible. Furthermore, consider the relation of the
cardinalities of a maximum matching and the largest matching in those pairs. It
is known that this relation does not exceed 5/4 for any graph. We characterize
the class of graphs for which this relation is precisely 5/4. Our
characterization implies that these graphs contain a spanning subgraph, every
component of which is the minimal graph of this class."
"The lower bound W(K_{2n})>=3n-2 is proved for the greatest possible number of
colors in an interval edge coloring of the complete graph K_{2n}."
"For complete graphs and n-cubes bounds are found for the possible number of
colours in an interval edge colourings."
"A non-empty set $X$ of vertices of an acyclic digraph is called connected if
the underlying undirected graph induced by $X$ is connected and it is called
convex if no two vertices of $X$ are connected by a directed path in which some
vertices are not in $X$. The set of convex sets (connected convex sets) of an
acyclic digraph $D$ is denoted by $\sco(D)$ ($\scc(D)$) and its size by
$\co(D)$ ($\cc(D)$). Gutin, Johnstone, Reddington, Scott, Soleimanfallah, and
Yeo (Proc. ACiD'07) conjectured that the sum of the sizes of all (connected)
convex sets in $D$ equals $\Theta(n \cdot \co(D))$ ($\Theta(n \cdot \cc(D))$)
where $n$ is the order of $D$.
  In this paper we exhibit a family of connected acyclic digraphs with
$\sum_{C\in \sco(D)}|C| = o(n\cdot \co(D))$ and $\sum_{C\in \scc(D)}|C| =
o(n\cdot \cc(D))$. We also show that the number of connected convex sets of
order $k$ in any connected acyclic digraph of order $n$ is at least $n-k+1$.
This is a strengthening of a theorem by Gutin and Yeo."
"A lower bound is obtained for the greatest possible number of colors in an
interval colourings of some regular graphs."
"Problems of existence, construction and estimation of parameters of interval
colorings of complete k-partite graphs K_{n}^{k} are investigated."
"An interval edge t-coloring of a graph G is a proper edge coloring of G with
colors 1,2...,t such that at least one edge of G is colored by color
i,i=1,2...,t, and the edges incident with each vertex v are colored by d_{G}(v)
consecutive colors, where d_{G}(v) is the degree of the vertex v in G. In this
paper interval edge colorings of bipartite cylinders and bipartite tori are
investigated."
"This paper presents the generalization of weighted distances to modules and
their computation through the chamfer algorithm on general point lattices. The
first part is dedicated to formalization of definitions and properties
(distance, metric, norm) of weighted distances on modules. It resumes tools
found in literature to express the weighted distance of any point of a module
and to compute optimal weights in the general case to get rotation invariant
distances. The second part of this paper proves that, for any point lattice,
the sequential two-scan chamfer algorithm produces correct distance maps.
Finally, the definitions and computation of weighted distances are applied to
the face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) grids."
"This paper deals with the decidability of semigroup freeness. More precisely,
the freeness problem over a semigroup S is defined as: given a finite subset X
of S, decide whether each element of S has at most one factorization over X. To
date, the decidabilities of two freeness problems have been closely examined.
In 1953, Sardinas and Patterson proposed a now famous algorithm for the
freeness problem over the free monoid. In 1991, Klarner, Birget and Satterfield
proved the undecidability of the freeness problem over three-by-three integer
matrices. Both results led to the publication of many subsequent papers. The
aim of the present paper is three-fold: (i) to present general results
concerning freeness problems, (ii) to study the decidability of freeness
problems over various particular semigroups (special attention is devoted to
multiplicative matrix semigroups), and (iii) to propose precise, challenging
open questions in order to promote the study of the topic."
"We investigate the Boolean functions with essential arity gap 2. We use Full
Conjunctive Normal Forms instead of Zhegalkin's polynomials, which allow us to
simplify the proofs and to obtain several combinatorial results, concerning the
Boolean functions with a given arity gap."
"The robustness of a network is depending on the type of attack we are
considering. In this paper we focus on the spread of viruses on networks. It is
common practice to use the epidemic threshold as a measure for robustness.
Because the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the largest
eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, it seems easy to compare the robustness of
two networks. We will show in this paper that the comparison of the robustness
with respect to virus spread for two networks actually depends on the value of
the effective spreading rate tau. For this reason we propose a new metric, the
viral conductance, which takes into account the complete range of values tau
can obtain. In this paper we determine the viral conductance of regular graphs,
complete bi-partite graphs and a number of realistic networks."
"An asteroidal triple is a stable set of three vertices such that each pair is
connected by a path avoiding the neighborhood of the third vertex. Asteroidal
triples play a central role in a classical characterization of interval graphs
by Lekkerkerker and Boland. Their result says that a chordal graph is an
interval graph if and only if it contains no asteroidal triple. In this paper,
we prove an analogous theorem for directed path graphs which are the
intersection graphs of directed paths in a directed tree. For this purpose, we
introduce the notion of a strong path. Two non-adjacent vertices are linked by
a strong path if either they have a common neighbor or they are the endpoints
of two vertex-disjoint chordless paths satisfying certain conditions. A strong
asteroidal triple is an asteroidal triple such that each pair is linked by a
strong path. We prove that a chordal graph is a directed path graph if and only
if it contains no strong asteroidal triple. We also introduce a related notion
of asteroidal quadruple, and conjecture a characterization of rooted path
graphs which are the intersection graphs of directed paths in a rooted tree."
"In Graph Minor III, Robertson and Seymour conjecture that the tree-width of a
planar graph and that of its dual differ by at most one. We prove that given a
hypergraph H on a surface of Euler genus k, the tree-width of H^* is at most
the maximum of tw(H) + 1 + k and the maximum size of a hyperedge of H^*."
"Bob cuts a pizza into slices of not necessarily equal size and shares it with
Alice by alternately taking turns. One slice is taken in each turn. The first
turn is Alice's. She may choose any of the slices. In all other turns only
those slices can be chosen that have a neighbor slice already eaten. We prove a
conjecture of Peter Winkler by showing that Alice has a strategy for obtaining
4/9 of the pizza. This is best possible, that is, there is a cutting and a
strategy for Bob to get 5/9 of the pizza. We also give a characterization of
Alice's best possible gain depending on the number of slices. For a given
cutting of the pizza, we describe a linear time algorithm that computes Alice's
strategy gaining at least 4/9 of the pizza and another algorithm that computes
the optimal strategy for both players in any possible position of the game in
quadratic time. We distinguish two types of turns, shifts and jumps. We prove
that Alice can gain 4/9, 7/16 and 1/3 of the pizza if she is allowed to make at
most two jumps, at most one jump and no jump, respectively, and the three
constants are the best possible."
"Z-mapping graph is a balanced bipartite graph $G$ of a digraph $D$ by split
each vertex of $D$ into a pair of vertices of $G$. Based on the property of the
$G$, it is proved that if $D$ is strong connected and $G$ is Hamiltonian, then
$D$ is Hamiltonian. It is also proved if $D$ is Hamiltonian, then $G$ contains
at least a perfect matching. Thus some existence sufficient conditions for
Hamiltonian digraph and Hamiltonian graph are proved to be equivalent, and two
sufficient conditions of disjoint Hamiltonian digraph are given in this paper."
"Map vertices of a graph to (not necessarily distinct) points of the plane so
that two adjacent vertices are mapped at least a unit distance apart. The
plane-width of a graph is the minimum diameter of the image of the vertex set
over all such mappings. We establish a relation between the plane-width of a
graph and its chromatic number, and connect it to other well-known areas,
including the circular chromatic number and the problem of packing unit discs
in the plane. We also investigate how plane-width behaves under various
operations, such as homomorphism, disjoint union, complement, and the Cartesian
product."
"Let $\Gamma$ be directed strongly connected finite graph of uniform outdegree
(constant outdegree of any vertex) and let some coloring of edges of $\Gamma$
turn the graph into deterministic complete automaton. Let the word $s$ be a
word in the alphabet of colors (considered also as letters) on the edges of
$\Gamma$ and let $\Gamma s$ be a mapping of vertices $\Gamma$."
"The paper deals with a non-linear system largely used in biology, which, in
certain conditions and for particular coefficient values, becomes linear, with
a linear diagram over a large range of time. It can be used as a veritable
regulator in systems' control"
"Applied into a various area of domains, the graph theory and its applications
allow the determination of the shortest route. The common algorithm to solve
this problem is Bellman-Kalaba, based on the matrix multiplying operation. If
the graph is very large (e.g., the dimension of the associated incidence matrix
is big) one of the main problems is to reduce the calculus time. This paper
presents a testing method able to analyze if an acceleration of the
Bellman-Kalaba is possible and able to determine the time efficiency."
"To asses the advantages of a computerized surveillance system to detect
Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI). All HAI reported to the Timis County

"Categories of partial functions have become increasingly important
principally because of their applications in theoretical computer science. In
this note we prove that the category of partial bijections between sets as an
inverse-Baer*-category with closed projections and in which the idempotent
split is an exact category. Finally the Noether isomorphism theorems are given
for this exact category."
"Winfree (1998) showed that discrete Sierpinski triangles can self-assemble in
the Tile Assembly Model. A striking molecular realization of this
self-assembly, using DNA tiles a few nanometers long and verifying the results
by atomic-force microscopy, was achieved by Rothemund, Papadakis, and Winfree
(2004). Precisely speaking, the above self-assemblies tile completely
filled-in, two-dimensional regions of the plane, with labeled subsets of these
tiles representing discrete Sierpinski triangles. This paper addresses the more
challenging problem of the strict self-assembly of discrete Sierpinski
triangles, i.e., the task of tiling a discrete Sierpinski triangle and nothing
else. We first prove that the standard discrete Sierpinski triangle cannot
strictly self-assemble in the Tile Assembly Model. We then define the fibered
Sierpinski triangle, a discrete Sierpinski triangle with the same fractal
dimension as the standard one but with thin fibers that can carry data, and
show that the fibered Sierpinski triangle strictly self-assembles in the Tile
Assembly Model. In contrast with the simple XOR algorithm of the earlier,
non-strict self-assemblies, our strict self-assembly algorithm makes extensive,
recursive use of optimal counters, coupled with measured delay and
corner-turning operations. We verify our strict self-assembly using the local
determinism method of Soloveichik and Winfree (2007)."
"We prove that if a set $X \subseteq \Z^2$ weakly self-assembles at
temperature 1 in a deterministic tile assembly system satisfying a natural
condition known as \emph{pumpability}, then $X$ is a finite union of
semi-doubly periodic sets. This shows that only the most simple of infinite
shapes and patterns can be constructed using pumpable temperature 1 tile
assembly systems, and gives evidence for the thesis that temperature 2 or
higher is required to carry out general-purpose computation in a tile assembly
system. Finally, we show that general-purpose computation \emph{is} possible at
temperature 1 if negative glue strengths are allowed in the tile assembly
model."
"In a recent paper, Amini et al. introduce a general framework to prove
duality theorems between special decompositions and their dual combinatorial
object. They thus unify all known ad-hoc proofs in one single theorem. While
this unification process is definitely good, their main theorem remains quite
technical and does not give a real insight of why some decompositions admit
dual objects and why others do not. The goal of this paper is both to
generalise a little this framework and to give an enlightening simple proof of
its central theorem."
"We show that there exists an uniformly recurrent infinite word whose set of
factors is closed under reversal and which has only finitely many palindromic
factors."
"In genome rearrangement theory, one of the elusive questions raised in recent
years is the enumeration of rearrangement scenarios between two genomes. This
problem is related to the uniform generation of rearrangement scenarios, and
the derivation of tests of statistical significance of the properties of these
scenarios. Here we give an exact formula for the number of double-cut-and-join
(DCJ) rearrangement scenarios of co-tailed genomes. We also construct effective
bijections between the set of scenarios that sort a cycle and well studied
combinatorial objects such as parking functions and labeled trees."
"We investigate the possibility of proving upper bounds on Hadwiger's number
of a graph with partial information, mirroring several known upper bounds for
the chromatic number. For each such bound we determine whether the
corresponding bound for Hadwiger's number holds. Our results suggest that the
``locality'' of an inequality accounts for the existence of such an extension."
"The present paper refers to the theory and the practice of the systems
regarding non-linear systems and their applications. We aimed the integration
of these systems to elaborate their response as well as to highlight some
outstanding features."
"Sum of powers 1^p+...+n^p, with n and p being natural numbers and n>=1, can
be expressed as a polynomial function of n of degree p+1. Such representations
are often called Faulhaber formulae. A simple recursive algorithm for computing
coefficients of Faulhaber formulae is presented. The correctness of the
algorithm is proved by giving a recurrence relation on Faulhaber formulae."
"Many real discrete optimization problems (DOPs) are $NP$-hard and contain a
huge number of variables and/or constraints that make the models intractable
for currently available solvers. Large DOPs can be solved due to their special
tructure using decomposition approaches. An important example of decomposition
approaches is tree decomposition with local decomposition algorithms using the
special block matrix structure of constraints which can exploit sparsity in the
interaction graph of a discrete optimization problem. In this paper, discrete
optimization problems with a tree structural graph are solved by local
decomposition algorithms. Local decomposition algorithms generate a family of
related DO problems which have the same structure but differ in the right-hand
sides. Due to this fact, postoptimality techniques in DO are applied."
"In this paper we have defined two functions that have been used to construct
different fractals having fractal dimensions between 1 and 2. More precisely,
we can say that one of our defined functions produce the fractals whose fractal
dimension lies in [1.58, 2) and rest function produce the fractals whose
fractal dimension lies in (1, 1.58]. Also we tried to calculate the amount of
increment of fractal dimension in accordance with base of the number systems.
And in switching of fractals from one base to another, the increment of fractal
dimension is constant, which is 1.58, its quite surprising!"
"For a tree Markov random field non-reconstruction is said to hold if as the
depth of the tree goes to infinity the information that a typical configuration
at the leaves gives about the value at the root goes to zero. The distribution
of the measure at the root conditioned on a typical boundary can be computed
using a distributional recurrence. However the exact computation is not
feasible because the support of the distribution grows exponentially with the
depth.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of a survey of a distribution over
probability vectors which is a succinct representation of the true
distribution. We show that a survey of the distribution of the measure at the
root can be constructed by an efficient recursive algorithm. The key properties
of surveys are that the size does not grow with the depth, they can be
constructed recursively, and they still provide a good bound for the distance
between the true conditional distribution and the unconditional distribution at
the root. This approach applies to a large class of Markov random field models
including randomly generated ones. As an application we show bounds on the
reconstruction threshold for the Potts model on small-degree trees."
"The QSAT problem is the quantified version of the SAT problem. We show the
existence of a threshold effect for the phase transition associated with the
satisfiability of random quantified extended 2-CNF formulas. We consider
boolean CNF formulas of the form $\forall X \exists Y \varphi(X,Y)$, where $X$
has $m$ variables, $Y$ has $n$ variables and each clause in $\varphi$ has one
literal from $X$ and two from $Y$. For such formulas, we show that the
threshold phenomenon is controlled by the ratio between the number of clauses
and the number $n$ of existential variables. Then we give the exact location of
the associated critical ratio $c^{*}$. Indeed, we prove that $c^{*}$ is a
decreasing function of $ \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the limiting value of $m /
\log (n)$ when $n$ tends to infinity."
"In this thesis we consider ordered graphs (that is, graphs with a fixed
linear ordering on their vertices). We summarize and further investigations on
the number of edges an ordered graph may have while avoiding a fixed forbidden
ordered graph as a subgraph. In particular, we take a step toward confirming a
conjecture of Pach and Tardos regarding the number of edges allowed when the
forbidden pattern is a tree by establishing an upper bound for a particular
ordered graph for which existing techniques have failed. We also generalize a
theorem of Geneson by establishing an upper bound on the number of edges
allowed if the forbidden graphs fit a generalized notion of a matching."
"In this paper, we settle the open complexity status of interval constrained
coloring with a fixed number of colors. We prove that the problem is already
NP-complete if the number of different colors is 3. Previously, it has only
been known that it is NP-complete, if the number of colors is part of the input
and that the problem is solvable in polynomial time, if the number of colors is
at most 2. We also show that it is hard to satisfy almost all of the
constraints for a feasible instance."
"An incidence in a graph $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$ with $v \in V(G)$ and $e \in
E(G)$, such that $v$ and $e$ are incident. Two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(w,f)$
are adjacent if $v=w$, or $e=f$, or the edge $vw$ equals $e$ or $f$. The
incidence chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest $k$ for which there exists a
mapping from the set of incidences of $G$ to a set of $k$ colors that assigns
distinct colors to adjacent incidences. In this paper, we prove that the
incidence chromatic number of the toroidal grid $T_{m,n}=C_m\Box C_n$ equals 5
when $m,n \equiv 0 \pmod 5$ and 6 otherwise."
"A (v,b,r,k) combinatorial configuration is a (r,k)-biregular bipartite graph

Configurable tuples are those tuples (v,b,r,k) for which a (v,b,r,k)
combinatorial configuration exists. It is proved in this work that the set of
configurable tuples with fixed r and k has the structure of a numerical
semigroup. The numerical semigroup is completely described for r=2 and r=3."
"In this paper we investigate how much Hamiltonian cycles weigh in K_4 and K_5
compare to the total weight of the graph and establish precise estimates."
"The biologist Ren\'e Thomas conjectured, twenty years ago, that the presence
of a negative feedback circuit in the interaction graph of a dynamical system
is a necessary condition for this system to produce sustained oscillations. In
this paper, we state and prove this conjecture for asynchronous automata
networks, a class of discrete dynamical systems extensively used to model the
behaviors of gene networks. As a corollary, we obtain the following fixed point
theorem: given a product $X$ of $n$ finite intervals of integers, and a map $F$
from $X$ to itself, if the interaction graph associated with $F$ has no
negative circuit, then $F$ has at least one fixed point."
"We prove that the treewidth of an Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\rg{n,
m}$ is, with high probability, greater than $\beta n$ for some constant $\beta
> 0$ if the edge/vertex ratio $\frac{m}{n}$ is greater than 1.073. Our lower
bound $\frac{m}{n} > 1.073$ improves the only previously-known lower bound. We
also study the treewidth of random graphs under two other random models for
large-scale complex networks. In particular, our result on the treewidth of
\rigs strengths a previous observation on the average-case behavior of the
\textit{gate matrix layout} problem. For scale-free random graphs based on the
Barab\'{a}si-Albert preferential-attachment model, our result shows that if
more than 12 vertices are attached to a new vertex, then the treewidth of the
obtained network is linear in the size of the network with high probability."
"We investigate hypergraphic LP relaxations for the Steiner tree problem,
primarily the partition LP relaxation introduced by Koenemann et al. [Math.
Programming, 2009]. Specifically, we are interested in proving upper bounds on
the integrality gap of this LP, and studying its relation to other linear
relaxations. Our results are the following. Structural results: We extend the
technique of uncrossing, usually applied to families of sets, to families of
partitions. As a consequence we show that any basic feasible solution to the
partition LP formulation has sparse support. Although the number of variables
could be exponential, the number of positive variables is at most the number of
terminals. Relations with other relaxations: We show the equivalence of the
partition LP relaxation with other known hypergraphic relaxations. We also show
that these hypergraphic relaxations are equivalent to the well studied
bidirected cut relaxation, if the instance is quasibipartite. Integrality gap
upper bounds: We show an upper bound of sqrt(3) ~ 1.729 on the integrality gap
of these hypergraph relaxations in general graphs. In the special case of
uniformly quasibipartite instances, we show an improved upper bound of 73/60 ~
1.216. By our equivalence theorem, the latter result implies an improved upper
bound for the bidirected cut relaxation as well."
"To each Boolean function F from {0,1}^n to itself and each point x in
{0,1}^n, we associate the signed directed graph G_F(x) of order n that contains
a positive (resp. negative) arc from j to i if the partial derivative of f_i
with respect of x_j is positive (resp. negative) at point x. We then focus on
the following open problem: Is the absence of a negative circuit in G_F(x) for
all x in {0,1}^n a sufficient condition for F to have at least one fixed point?
As main result, we settle this problem under the additional condition that, for
all x in {0,1}^n, the out-degree of each vertex of G_F(x) is at most one."
"Deciding whether an arbitrary graph contains a sun was recently shown to be
NP-complete. We show that whether a building-free graph contains a sun can be
decided in O(min$\{m{n^3}, m^{1.5}n^2\}$) time and, if a sun exists, it can be
found in the same time bound. The class of building-free graphs contains many
interesting classes of perfect graphs such as Meyniel graphs which, in turn,
contains classes such as hhd-free graphs, i-triangulated graphs, and parity
graphs. Moreover, there are imperfect graphs that are building-free. The class
of building-free graphs generalizes several classes of graphs for which an
efficient test for the presence of a sun is known. We also present a vertex
elimination scheme for the class of (building, gem)-free graphs. The class of
(building, gem)-free graphs is a generalization of the class of distance
hereditary graphs and a restriction of the class of (building, sun)-free
graphs."
"Given a right-angled triangle of squares in a grid whose horizontal and
vertical sides are $n$ squares long, let N(n) denote the maximum number of dots
that can be placed into the cells of the triangle such that each row, each
column, and each diagonal parallel to the long side of the triangle contains at
most one dot. It has been proven that
  $N(n) = \lfloor \frac{2n+1}{3} \rfloor$.
  In this note, we give a new proof of this result using linear programming
techniques."
"We obtain a closed-form expression for the Wiener index of binomial trees. We
outline efficient algorithms for computing the Wiener indices of Fibonacci and
binary Fibonacci trees."
"An important question arising from the Frobenius Coin Problem is to decide
whether or not a given monetary sum S can be obtained from N coin
denominations. We develop a new Generating Function G(x), where the coefficient
of x^i is equal to the number of ways in which coins from the given
denominations can be arranged as a stack whose total monetary worth is i. We
show that the Recurrence Relation for obtaining G(x), is linear, enabling G(x)
to be expressed as a rational function, that is, G(x) = P(x)/Q(x), where both
P(x) and Q(x) are Polynomials whose degrees are bounded by the largest coin
denomination."
"Two Diophantine equation generator function for integer residuals produced by
integer division over closed intervals are presented. One each for the closed
intervals [1,Floor(n^0.5)] and [Ceiling(n^0.5),n], respectively."
"Randomized rumor spreading is a classical protocol to disseminate information
across a network. At SODA 2008, a quasirandom version of this protocol was
proposed and competitive bounds for its run-time were proven. This prompts the
question: to what extent does the quasirandom protocol inherit the second
principal advantage of randomized rumor spreading, namely robustness against
transmission failures?
  In this paper, we present a result precise up to $(1 \pm o(1))$ factors. We
limit ourselves to the network in which every two vertices are connected by a
direct link. Run-times accurate to their leading constants are unknown for all
other non-trivial networks.
  We show that if each transmission reaches its destination with a probability
of $p \in (0,1]$, after $(1+\e)(\frac{1}{\log_2(1+p)}\log_2n+\frac{1}{p}\ln n)$
rounds the quasirandom protocol has informed all $n$ nodes in the network with
probability at least $1-n^{-p\e/40}$. Note that this is faster than the
intuitively natural $1/p$ factor increase over the run-time of approximately
$\log_2 n + \ln n $ for the non-corrupted case.
  We also provide a corresponding lower bound for the classical model. This
demonstrates that the quasirandom model is at least as robust as the fully
random model despite the greatly reduced degree of independent randomness."
"In this paper we study a new product of graphs called {\em tight product}. A
graph $H$ is said to be a tight product of two (undirected multi) graphs $G_1$
and $G_2$, if $V(H)=V(G_1)\times V(G_2)$ and both projection maps $V(H)\to
V(G_1)$ and $V(H)\to V(G_2)$ are covering maps. It is not a priori clear when
two given graphs have a tight product (in fact, it is $NP$-hard to decide). We
investigate the conditions under which this is possible. This perspective
yields a new characterization of class-1 $(2k+1)$-regular graphs. We also
obtain a new model of random $d$-regular graphs whose second eigenvalue is
almost surely at most $O(d^{3/4})$. This construction resembles random graph
lifts, but requires fewer random bits."
"In the classical cop and robber game, two players, the cop C and the robber
R, move alternatively along edges of a finite graph G. The cop captures the
robber if both players are on the same vertex at the same moment of time. A
graph G is called cop win if the cop always captures the robber after a finite
number of steps. Nowakowski, Winkler (1983) and Quilliot (1983) characterized
the cop-win graphs as graphs admitting a dismantling scheme. In this paper, we
characterize in a similar way the class CW(s,s') of cop-win graphs in the game
in which the cop and the robber move at different speeds s' and s, s'<= s. We
also establish some connections between cop-win graphs for this game with s'<s
and Gromov's hyperbolicity. In the particular case s'=1 and s=2, we prove that
the class of cop-win graphs is exactly the well-known class of dually chordal
graphs. We show that all classes CW(s,1), s>=3, coincide and we provide a
structural characterization of these graphs. We also investigate several
dismantling schemes necessary or sufficient for the cop-win graphs in the game
in which the robber is visible only every k moves for a fixed integer k>1. We
characterize the graphs which are cop-win for any value of k. Finally, we
consider the game where the cop wins if he is at distance at most 1 from the
robber and we characterize via a specific dismantling scheme the bipartite
graphs where a single cop wins in this game."
"This paper studies directional dynamics in cellular automata, a formalism
previously introduced by the third author. The central idea is to study the
dynamical behaviour of a cellular automaton through the conjoint action of its
global rule (temporal action) and the shift map (spacial action): qualitative
behaviours inherited from topological dynamics (equicontinuity, sensitivity,
expansivity) are thus considered along arbitrary curves in space-time. The main
contributions of the paper concern equicontinuous dynamics which can be
connected to the notion of consequences of a word. We show that there is a
cellular automaton with an equicontinuous dynamics along a parabola, but which
is sensitive along any linear direction. We also show that real numbers that
occur as the slope of a limit linear direction with equicontinuous dynamics in
some cellular automaton are exactly the computably enumerable numbers."
"A (non-circular) de Bruijn sequence w of order n is a word such that every
word of length n appears exactly once in w as a factor. In this paper, we
generalize the concept to a multi-shift setting: a multi-shift de Bruijn
sequence tau(m,n) of shift m and order n is a word such that every word of
length n appears exactly once in w as a factor that starts at index im+1 for
some integer i>=0. We show the number of the multi-shift de Bruijn sequence
tau(m,n) is (a^n)!a^{(m-n)(a^n-1)} for 1<=n<=m and is (a^m!)^{a^{n-m}} for
1<=m<=n, where a=|Sigma|. We provide two algorithms for generating a tau(m,n).
The multi-shift de Bruijn sequence is important in solving the Frobenius
problem in a free monoid."
"We consider the {\em Capacitated Domination} problem, which models a
service-requirement assignment scenario and is also a generalization of the
well-known {\em Dominating Set} problem. In this problem, given a graph with
three parameters defined on each vertex, namely cost, capacity, and demand, we
want to find an assignment of demands to vertices of least cost such that the
demand of each vertex is satisfied subject to the capacity constraint of each
vertex providing the service. In terms of polynomial time approximations, we
present logarithmic approximation algorithms with respect to different demand
assignment models for this problem on general graphs, which also establishes
the corresponding approximation results to the well-known approximations of the
traditional {\em Dominating Set} problem. Together with our previous work, this
closes the problem of generally approximating the optimal solution. On the
other hand, from the perspective of parameterization, we prove that this
problem is {\it W[1]}-hard when parameterized by a structure of the graph
called treewidth. Based on this hardness result, we present exact
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms when parameterized by treewidth and
maximum capacity of the vertices. This algorithm is further extended to obtain
pseudo-polynomial time approximation schemes for planar graphs."
"We characterize the compatibility of a collection of unrooted phylogenetic
trees as a question of determining whether a graph derived from these trees ---
the display graph --- has a specific kind of triangulation, which we call
legal. Our result is a counterpart to the well known triangulation-based
characterization of the compatibility of undirected multi-state characters."
"We consider multi-dimensional assignment problems in a probabilistic setting.
Our main results are: (i) A new efficient algorithm for the 3-dimensional
planar problem, based on enumerating and selecting from a set of
""alternating-path trees""; (ii) A new efficient matching-based algorithm for the
3-dimensional axial problem."
"Given a graph $G$, the longest path problem asks to compute a simple path of
$G$ with the largest number of vertices. This problem is the most natural
optimization version of the well known and well studied Hamiltonian path
problem, and thus it is NP-hard on general graphs. However, in contrast to the
Hamiltonian path problem, there are only few restricted graph families such as
trees and some small graph classes where polynomial algorithms for the longest
path problem have been found. Recently it has been shown that this problem can
be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs by applying dynamic programming
to a characterizing ordering of the vertices of the given graph
\cite{longest-int-algo}, thus answering an open question. In the present paper,
we provide the first polynomial algorithm for the longest path problem on a
much greater class, namely on cocomparability graphs. Our algorithm uses a
similar - but essentially simpler - dynamic programming approach, which is
applied to a Lexicographic Depth First Search (LDFS) characterizing ordering of
the vertices of a cocomparability graph. Therefore, our results provide
evidence that this general dynamic programming approach can be used in a more
general setting, leading to efficient algorithms for the longest path problem
on greater classes of graphs. LDFS has recently been introduced in
\cite{Corneil-LDFS08}. Since then, a similar phenomenon of extending an
existing interval graph algorithm to cocomparability graphs by using an LDFS
preprocessing step has also been observed for the minimum path cover problem
\cite{Corneil-MPC}. Therefore, more interestingly, our results also provide
evidence that cocomparability graphs present an interval graph structure when
they are considered using an LDFS ordering of their vertices, which may lead to
other new and more efficient combinatorial algorithms."
"We often encounter probability distributions given as unnormalized products
of non-negative functions. The factorization structures are represented by
hypergraphs called factor graphs. Such distributions appear in various fields,
including statistics, artificial intelligence, statistical physics, error
correcting codes, etc. Given such a distribution, computations of marginal
distributions and the normalization constant are often required. However, they
are computationally intractable because of their computational costs. One
successful approximation method is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm.
The focus of this thesis is an analysis of the LBP algorithm. If the factor
graph is a tree, i.e. having no cycle, the algorithm gives the exact
quantities. If the factor graph has cycles, however, the LBP algorithm does not
give exact results and possibly exhibits oscillatory and non-convergent
behaviors. The thematic question of this thesis is ""How the behaviors of the
LBP algorithm are affected by the discrete geometry of the factor graph?"" The
primary contribution of this thesis is the discovery of a formula that
establishes the relation between the LBP, the Bethe free energy and the graph
zeta function. This formula provides new techniques for analysis of the LBP
algorithm, connecting properties of the graph and of the LBP and the Bethe free
energy. We demonstrate applications of the techniques to several problems
including (non) convexity of the Bethe free energy, the uniqueness and
stability of the LBP fixed point. We also discuss the loop series initiated by
Chertkov and Chernyak. The loop series is a subgraph expansion of the
normalization constant, or partition function, and reflects the graph geometry.
We investigate theoretical natures of the series. Moreover, we show a partial
connection between the loop series and the graph zeta function."
"A b-coloring is a coloring of the vertices of a graph such that each color
class contains a vertex that has a neighbor in all other color classes, and the
b-chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the largest integer $k$ such that $G$
admits a b-coloring with $k$ colors. A graph is b-perfect if the b-chromatic
number is equal to the chromatic number for every induced subgraph of $G$. We
prove that a graph is b-perfect if and only if it does not contain as an
induced subgraph a member of a certain list of twenty-two graphs. This entails
the existence of a polynomial-time recognition algorithm and of a
polynomial-time algorithm for coloring exactly the vertices of every b-perfect
graph."
"Given non-negative integers $n_{i}$ and $\alpha_{i}$ with $0 \leq \alpha_{i}
\leq n_i$ $(i=1,2,...,k)$, an
$[\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},...,\alpha_{k}]$-$k$-partite hypertournament on
$\sum_{1}^{k}n_{i}$ vertices is a $(k+1)$-tuple $(U_{1},U_{2},...,U_{k},E)$,
where $U_{i}$ are $k$ vertex sets with $|U_{i}|=n_{i}$, and $E$ is a set of
$\sum_{1}^{k}\alpha_{i}$-tuples of vertices, called arcs, with exactly
$\alpha_{i}$ vertices from $U_{i}$, such that any $\sum_{1}^{k}\alpha_{i}$
subset $\cup_{1}^{k}U_{i}^{\prime}$ of $\cup_{1}^{k}U_{i}$, $E$ contains
exactly one of the $(\sum_{1}^{k} \alpha_{i})!$ $\sum_{1}^{k}\alpha_{i}$-tuples
whose entries belong to $\cup_{1}^{k}U_{i}^{\prime}$. We obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions for $k$ lists of non-negative integers in non-decreasing
order to be the losing score lists and to be the score lists of some
$k$-partite hypertournament."
"We present here an elementary construction of an aperiodic tile set. Although
there already exist dozens of examples of aperiodic tile sets we believe this
construction introduces an approach that is different enough to be interesting
and that the whole construction and the proof of aperiodicity are hopefully
simpler than most existing techniques."
"For integers k>0 and r>0, a conditional (k,r)-coloring of a graph G is a
proper k-coloring of the vertices of G such that every vertex v of degree d(v)
in G is adjacent to vertices with at least min{r,d(v)} different colors. The
smallest integer k for which a graph G has a conditional (k,r)-coloring is
called the rth order conditional chromatic number, denoted by $\chi_r(G)$. For
different values of r we obtain $\chi_r(G)$ of certain parameterized graphs
viz., Windmill graph, line graph of Windmill graph, middle graph of Friendship
graph, middle graph of a cycle, line graph of Friendship graph, middle graph of
complete k-partite graph and middle graph of a bipartite graph."
"The simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP) concerns the assignment of
tasks with pre-defined processing times to work stations that are arranged in a
line. Hereby, precedence constraints between the tasks must be respected. The
optimization goal of the SALBP-2 version of the problem concerns the
minimization of the so-called cycle time, that is, the time in which the tasks
of each work station must be completed.
  In this work we propose to tackle this problem with an iterative search
method based on beam search. The proposed algorithm is able to obtain optimal,
respectively best-known, solutions in 283 out of 302 test cases. Moreover, for
9 further test cases the algorithm is able to produce new best-known solutions.
These numbers indicate that the proposed iterative beam search algorithm is
currently a state-of-the-art method for the SALBP-2."
"We consider set covering problems where the underlying set system satisfies a
particular replacement property w.r.t. a given partial order on the elements:
Whenever a set is in the set system then a set stemming from it via the
replacement of an element by a smaller element is also in the set system. Many
variants of BIN PACKING that have appeared in the literature are such set
covering problems with ordered replacement. We provide a rigorous account on
the additive and multiplicative integrality gap and approximability of set
covering with replacement. In particular we provide a polylogarithmic upper
bound on the additive integrality gap that also yields a polynomial time
additive approximation algorithm if the linear programming relaxation can be
efficiently solved. We furthermore present an extensive list of covering
problems that fall into our framework and consequently have polylogarithmic
additive gaps as well."
"We establish a simple generalization of a known result in the plane. The
simplices in any pure simplicial complex in R^d may be colored with d+1 colors
so that no two simplices that share a (d-1)-facet have the same color. In R^2
this says that any planar map all of whose faces are triangles may be
3-colored, and in R^3 it says that tetrahedra in a collection may be ""solid
4-colored"" so that no two glued face-to-face receive the same color."
"Markovian evolving graphs are dynamic-graph models where the links among a
fixed set of nodes change during time according to an arbitrary Markovian rule.
They are extremely general and they can well describe important dynamic-network
scenarios.
  We study the speed of information spreading in the ""stationary phase"" by
analyzing the completion time of the ""flooding mechanism"". We prove a general
theorem that establishes an upper bound on flooding time in any stationary
Markovian evolving graph in terms of its node-expansion properties.
  We apply our theorem in two natural and relevant cases of such dynamic
graphs. ""Geometric Markovian evolving graphs"" where the Markovian behaviour is
yielded by ""n"" mobile radio stations, with fixed transmission radius, that
perform independent random walks over a square region of the plane.
""Edge-Markovian evolving graphs"" where the probability of existence of any edge
at time ""t"" depends on the existence (or not) of the same edge at time ""t-1"".
  In both cases, the obtained upper bounds hold ""with high probability"" and
they are nearly tight. In fact, they turn out to be tight for a large range of
the values of the input parameters. As for geometric Markovian evolving graphs,
our result represents the first analytical upper bound for flooding time on a
class of concrete mobile networks."
"In this article we prove that multidimensional effective S-adic systems,
obtained by applying an effective sequence of substitutions chosen among a
finite set of substitutions, are sofic subshifts."
"In this paper, our goal is to characterize two graph classes based on the
properties of minimal vertex (edge) separators. We first present a structural
characterization of graphs in which every minimal vertex separator is a stable
set. We show that such graphs are precisely those in which the induced
subgraph, namely, a cycle with exactly one chord is forbidden. We also show
that deciding maximum such forbidden subgraph is NP-complete by establishing a
polynomial time reduction from maximum induced cycle problem [1]. This result
is of independent interest and can be used in other combinatorial problems.
Secondly, we prove that a graph has the following property: every minimal edge
separator induces a matching (that is no two edges share a vertex in common) if
and only if it is a tree."
"A Helly circular-arc model M = (C,A) is a circle C together with a Helly
family \A of arcs of C. If no arc is contained in any other, then M is a proper
Helly circular-arc model, if every arc has the same length, then M is a unit
Helly circular-arc model, and if there are no two arcs covering the circle,
then M is a normal Helly circular-arc model. A Helly (resp. proper Helly, unit
Helly, normal Helly) circular-arc graph is the intersection graph of the arcs
of a Helly (resp. proper Helly, unit Helly, normal Helly) circular-arc model.
In this article we study these subclasses of Helly circular-arc graphs. We show
natural generalizations of several properties of (proper) interval graphs that
hold for some of these Helly circular-arc subclasses. Next, we describe
characterizations for the subclasses of Helly circular-arc graphs, including
forbidden induced subgraphs characterizations. These characterizations lead to
efficient algorithms for recognizing graphs within these classes. Finally, we
show how do these classes of graphs relate with straight and round digraphs."
"An odd graceful labeling of a graph G=(V,E) is a function
f:V(G)->[0,1,2,...,2|E(G)|-1} such that |f(u)-f(v)| is odd value less than or
equal to 2|E(G)-1| for any u, v in V(G). In spite of the large number of papers
published on the subject of graph labeling, there are few algorithms to be used
by researchers to gracefully label graphs. This work provides generalized odd
graceful solutions to all the vertices and edges for the tensor product of the
two paths P_n and P_m denoted P_n^P_m . Firstly, we describe an algorithm to
label the vertices and the edges of the vertex set V(P_n^P_m) and the edge set
E(P_n^P_m) respectively. Finally, we prove that the graph P_n^P_m is odd
graceful for all integers n and m."
"A k-tree is either a complete graph on (k+1) vertices or given a k-tree G'
with n vertices, a k-tree G with (n+1) vertices can be constructed by
introducing a new vertex v and picking a k-clique Q in G' and then joining each
vertex u in Q. A graph G is k-edge-connected if the graph remains connected
even after deleting fewer edges than k from the graph. A k-edge-connected graph
G is said to be minimally k-connected if G \ {e} is no longer k-edge-connected
for any edge e belongs to E(G) where E(G) denotes the set of edges of G. In
this paper we find two separate O (n2) algorithms so that a minimally
2-connected graph can be obtained from a 2-tree and a minimally k-connected
graph can be obtained from a k-tree. In a k-tree (k \geq 2) we find the edges
which are insensitive to the k-connectivity have both their end vertices of
degrees greater than or equal to k+1.This property is fully exploited to find
an algorithm which reduces any k-tree to a minimally k-connected graph."
"This paper introduces a communication system for the tiles of the heptagrid,
a tiling of the hyperbolic plane. The method can be extended to other tilings
of this plane. The paper focuses on an actual implementation at the programming
stage with a short account of two experiments."
"In this paper we study the enumeration and the construction of particular
binary words avoiding the pattern $1^{j+1}0^j$. By means of the theory of
Riordan arrays, we solve the enumeration problem and we give a particular
succession rule, called jumping and marked succession rule, which describes the
growth of such words according to their number of ones. Moreover, the problem
of associating a word to a path in the generating tree obtained by the
succession rule is solved by introducing an algorithm which constructs all
binary words and then kills those containing the forbidden pattern."
"We consider the extension of the last-in-first-out graph searching game of
Giannopoulou and Thilikos to digraphs. We show that all common variations of
the game require the same number of searchers, and the minimal number of
searchers required is one more than the cycle-rank of the digraph. We also
obtain a tight duality theorem, giving a precise min-max characterization of
obstructions for cycle-rank."
"A graph $G$ is called a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists an
edge weighted tree $T$ and two non-negative real numbers $d_{min}$ and
$d_{max}$ such that each leaf $l_u$ of $T$ corresponds to a vertex $u \in V$
and there is an edge $(u,v) \in E$ if and only if $d_{min} \leq d_T (l_u, l_v)
\leq d_{max}$ where $d_T (l_u, l_v)$ is the sum of the weights of the edges on
the unique path from $l_u$ to $l_v$ in $T$. In this paper we analyze the class
of PCG in relation with two particular subclasses resulting from the the cases
where $\dmin=0$ (LPG) and $\dmax=+\infty$ (mLPG). In particular, we show that
the union of LPG and mLPG does not coincide with the whole class PCG, their
intersection is not empty, and that neither of the classes LPG and mLPG is
contained in the other. Finally, as the graphs we deal with belong to the more
general class of split matrogenic graphs, we focus on this class of graphs for
which we try to establish the membership to the PCG class."
"Clique separator decomposition introduced by Tarjan and Whitesides is one of
the most important graph decompositions. A graph is an {\em atom} if it has no
clique separator. A {\em hole} is a chordless cycle with at least five
vertices, and an {\em antihole} is the complement graph of a hole. A graph is
{\em weakly chordal} if it is hole- and antihole-free. $K_4-e$ is also called
{\em diamond}. {\em Paraglider} has five vertices four of which induce a
diamond, and the fifth vertex sees exactly the two vertices of degree two in
the diamond. In this paper we show that atoms of hole- and diamond-free graphs
(of hole- and paraglider-free graphs, respectively) are either weakly chordal
or of a very specific structure. Hole- and paraglider-free graphs are perfect
graphs. The structure of their atoms leads to efficient algorithms for various
problems."
"Quantitative characterization of randomly roving agents in wireless sensor
networks (WSN) is studied. Below the formula simplifications, regarding the
known results and publications, it is shown that the basic agent model is
probabilistically equivalent to a similar simpler model and then a formula for
frequencies is achieved in terms of combinatorial second kind Stirling numbers.
Stirling numbers are well studied and different estimates are known for them
letting to justify the roving agents quantitative characteristics."
"This paper presents a set of tools to compute topological information of
simplicial complexes, tools that are applicable to extract topological
information from digital pictures. A simplicial complex is encoded in a
(non-unique) algebraic-topological format called AM-model. An AM-model for a
given object K is determined by a concrete chain homotopy and it provides, in
particular, integer (co)homology generators of K and representative (co)cycles
of these generators. An algorithm for computing an AM-model and the
cohomological invariant HB1 (derived from the rank of the cohomology ring) with
integer coefficients for a finite simplicial complex in any dimension is
designed here. A concept of generators which are ""nicely"" representative cycles
is also presented. Moreover, we extend the definition of AM-models to 3D binary
digital images and we design algorithms to update the AM-model information
after voxel set operations (union, intersection, difference and inverse)."
"We investigate the question of which graphs have planar emulators (a
locally-surjective homomorphism from some finite planar graph) -- a problem
raised already in Fellows' thesis (1985) and conceptually related to the better
known planar cover conjecture by Negami (1986). For over two decades, the
planar emulator problem lived poorly in a shadow of Negami's conjecture--which
is still open--as the two were considered equivalent. But, in the end of 2008,
a surprising construction by Rieck and Yamashita falsified the natural ""planar
emulator conjecture"", and thus opened a whole new research field. We present
further results and constructions which show how far the planar-emulability
concept is from planar-coverability, and that the traditional idea of likening
it to projective embeddability is actually very out-of-place. We also present
several positive partial characterizations of planar-emulable graphs."
"Approximate random k-colouring of a graph G=(V,E) is a very well studied
problem in computer science and statistical physics. It amounts to constructing
a k-colouring of G which is distributed close to Gibbs distribution, i.e. the
uniform distribution over all the k-colourings of G. Here, we deal with the
problem when the underlying graph is an instance of Erdos-Renyi random graph
G(n,p), where p=d/n and d is fixed.
  We propose a novel efficient algorithm for approximate random k-colouring
with the following properties: given an instance of G(n,d/n) and for any
k>(2+\epsilon)d, it returns a k-colouring distributed within total variation
distance n^{-Omega(1)} from the Gibbs distribution, with probability
1-n^{-Omega(1)}.
  What we propose is neither a MCMC algorithm nor some algorithm inspired by
the message passing heuristics that were introduced by statistical physicist.
Our algorithm is of combinatorial nature. It is based on a rather simple
recursion which reduces the random k-colouring of G(n,d/n) to random
k-colouring simpler subgraphs first.
  The lower bound on the number of colours for our algorithm to run in
polynomial time is dramatically smaller than the corresponding bounds we have
for any previous algorithm."
"Alon, Seymour, and Thomas generalized Lipton and Tarjan's planar separator
theorem and showed that a $K_h$-minor free graph with $n$ vertices has a
separator of size at most $h^{3/2}\sqrt n$. They gave an algorithm that, given
a graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices and given an integer $h\geq 1$,
outputs in $O(\sqrt{hn}m)$ time such a separator or a $K_h$-minor of $G$.
Plotkin, Rao, and Smith gave an $O(hm\sqrt{n\log n})$ time algorithm to find a
separator of size $O(h\sqrt{n\log n})$. Kawarabayashi and Reed improved the
bound on the size of the separator to $h\sqrt n$ and gave an algorithm that
finds such a separator in $O(n^{1 + \epsilon})$ time for any constant $\epsilon
> 0$, assuming $h$ is constant. This algorithm has an extremely large
dependency on $h$ in the running time (some power tower of $h$ whose height is
itself a function of $h$), making it impractical even for small $h$. We are
interested in a small polynomial time dependency on $h$ and we show how to find
an $O(h\sqrt{n\log n})$-size separator or report that $G$ has a $K_h$-minor in
$O(\poly(h)n^{5/4 + \epsilon})$ time for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. We also
present the first $O(\poly(h)n)$ time algorithm to find a separator of size
$O(n^c)$ for a constant $c < 1$. As corollaries of our results, we get improved
algorithms for shortest paths and maximum matching. Furthermore, for integers
$\ell$ and $h$, we give an $O(m + n^{2 + \epsilon}/\ell)$ time algorithm that
either produces a $K_h$-minor of depth $O(\ell\log n)$ or a separator of size
at most $O(n/\ell + \ell h^2\log n)$. This improves the shallow minor algorithm
of Plotkin, Rao, and Smith when $m = \Omega(n^{1 + \epsilon})$. We get a
similar running time improvement for an approximation algorithm for the problem
of finding a largest $K_h$-minor in a given graph."
"Any system that is used for naming or representing numbers is a number
system, also known as numeral system. The modern civilization is familiar with
decimal number system using ten digits. However digital devices and computers
use binary number system instead of decimal number system, using only two
digits namely, 0 and 1 based on the fundamental concept of the decimal number
system. Various other number systems also used this fundamental concept of
decimal number system, for example octal system and hexadecimal number systems
using eight and sixteen digits respectively. The knowledge of number systems
and their inter conversion is essential for understanding of computers. More
over, successful programming for digital devices requires a precise
understanding of data formats, number systems and their inter conversion. The
inter conversion (a process in which things are each converted into the other)
of number system requires allot of time and techniques to expertise. In this
paper the interconversion of four most common number systems is taken under the
consideration in tabulated form. It is a step towards the easy interconversion
of theses number systems to understand as well as memorise it. The four number
systems are binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal."
"Five ordering algorithms for the nonserial dynamic programming algorithm for
solving sparse discrete optimization problems are compared in this paper. The
benchmarking reveals that the ordering of the variables has a significant
impact on the run-time of these algorithms. In addition, it is shown that
different orderings are most effective for different classes of problems.
Finally, it is shown that, amongst the algorithms considered here, heuristics
based on maximum cardinality search and minimum fill-in perform best for
solving the discrete optimization problems considered in this paper."
"The estimation of phase transitions in random boolean Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (CSP) is based on two fundamental tools: the first and second moment
methods. While the first moment method on the number of solutions permits to
compute upper bounds on any boolean CSP, the second moment method used for
computing lower bounds proves to be more tricky and in most cases gives only
the trivial lower bound 0. In this paper, we define a subclass of boolean CSP
covering the monotone versions of many known NP-Complete boolean CSPs. We give
a method for computing non trivial lower bounds for any member of this
subclass. This is achieved thanks to an application of the second moment method
to some selected solutions called characteristic solutions that depend on the
boolean CSP considered. We apply this method with a finer analysis to establish
that the threshold $r_{k}$ (ratio : #constrains/#variables) of monotone
1-in-k-SAT is $\log k/k\leq r_{k}\leq\log^{2}k/k$."
"The study of perfect numbers dates back to Euler and Mersenne. A perfect
number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors which are
said to include the multiplicative unit 1. The following theorem is a classical
number theory result. All even numbers are of the form $2^k(2^k-1)$ where
$2^k-1$ is a Mersenne prime, that is, a prime where $k=P$ and the number $P$ is
prime. One interesting conjecture is that there are no odd perfect numbers."
"More precise estimation of the greedy algorithm complexity for a special case
of the set cover problem is given in this paper."
"We consider the problem of finding all allowed edges in a bipartite graph
$G=(V,E)$, i.e., all edges that are included in some maximum matching. We show
that given any maximum matching in the graph, it is possible to perform this
computation in linear time $O(n+m)$ (where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$). Hence, the
time complexity of finding all allowed edges reduces to that of finding a
single maximum matching, which is $O(n^{1/2}m)$ [Hopcroft and Karp 1973], or
$O((n/\log n)^{1/2}m)$ for dense graphs with $m=\Theta(n^2)$ [Alt et al. 1991].
This time complexity improves upon that of the best known algorithms for the
problem, which is $O(nm)$ ([Costa 1994] for bipartite graphs, and [Carvalho and
Cheriyan 2005] for general graphs). Other algorithms for solving that problem
are randomized algorithms due to [Rabin and Vazirani 1989] and [Cheriyan 1997],
the runtime of which is $\tilde{O}(n^{2.376})$. Our algorithm, apart from being
deterministic, improves upon that time complexity for bipartite graphs when
$m=O(n^r)$ and $r<1.876$. In addition, our algorithm is elementary,
conceptually simple, and easy to implement."
"In this paper we classify all extremal and $s$-extremal binary self-dual
codes of length 38. There are exactly 2744 extremal $[38,19,8]$ self-dual
codes, two $s$-extremal $[38,19,6]$ codes, and 1730 $s$-extremal $[38,19,8]$
codes. We obtain our results from the use of a recursive algorithm used in the
recent classification of all extremal self-dual codes of length 36, and from a
generalization of this recursive algorithm for the shadow. The classification
of $s$-extremal $[38,19,6]$ codes permits to achieve the classification of all
$s$-extremal codes with d=6."
"We show that minimum connected $(s,t)$-vertex separator ($(s,t)$-CVS) is
$\Omega(log^{2-\epsilon}n)$-hard for any $\epsilon >0$ unless NP has
quasi-polynomial Las-Vegas algorithms. i.e., for any $\epsilon >0$ and for some
$\delta >0$, $(s,t)$-CVS is unlikely to have
$\delta.log^{2-\epsilon}n$-approximation algorithm. We show that $(s,t)$-CVS is
NP-complete on graphs with chordality at least 5 and present a polynomial-time
algorithm for $(s,t)$-CVS on bipartite chordality 4 graphs. We also present a
$\lceil\frac{c}{2}\rceil$-approximation algorithm for $(s,t)$-CVS on graphs
with chordality $c$. Finally, from the parameterized setting, we show that
$(s,t)$-CVS parameterized above the $(s,t)$-vertex connectivity is $W[2]$-hard."
"Although models are built on the basis of some observations of reality, the
concepts that derive theoretically from their definitions as well as from their
characteristics and properties are not necessarily direct consequences of these
initial observations. Indeed, many of them rather follow from chains of
theoretical inferences that are only based on the precise model definitions and
rely strongly, in addition, on some consequential working hypotheses. Thus, it
is important to address the question of which features of a model effectively
carry some modelling meaning and which only result from the task of formalising
observations of reality into a mathematical language. In this article, we
address this question with a theoretical point view that sets our discussion
strictly between the two stages of the modelling process that require knowledge
of real systems, that is, between the initial stage that chooses a global
theoretical framework to build the model and the final stage that exploits its
formal predictions by comparing them to the reality that the model was designed
to simulate. Taking Boolean automata networks as instances of models of systems
observed in reality, we analyse in this setting the remaining stages of the
modelling process and we show how the meaning of theoretical concepts can
subtly rely on formal choices such as definitions and hypotheses."
"The iterated Johnson bound is the best known upper bound on a size of an
error-correcting code in the Grassmannian $\mathcal{G}_q(n,k)$. The iterated
Sch\""{o}nheim bound is the best known lower bound on the size of a covering
code in $\mathcal{G}_q(n,k)$. We use probabilistic methods to prove that both
bounds are asymptotically attained for fixed $k$ and fixed radius, as $n$
approaches infinity. We also determine the asymptotics of the size of the best
Grassmannian codes and covering codes when $n-k$ and the radius are fixed, as
$n$ approaches infinity."
"Havel in 1955, Erd\H{o}s and Gallai in 1960, Hakimi in 1962, Ruskey, Cohen,
Eades and Scott in 1994, Barnes and Savage in 1997, Kohnert in 2004, Tripathi,
Venugopalan and West in 2010 proposed a method to decide, whether a sequence of
nonnegative integers can be the degree sequence of a simple graph. The running
time of their algorithms is $\Omega(n^2)$ in worst case. In this paper we
propose a new algorithm called EGL (Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Linear algorithm), whose
worst running time is $\Theta(n).$ As an application of this quick algorithm we
computed the number of the different degree sequences of simple graphs for $24,
...,29$ vertices."
"In this paper we deal with the problem of finding the smallest and the
largest elements of a totally ordered set of size $n$ using pairwise
comparisons if $k$ of the comparisons might be erroneous where $k$ is a fixed
constant. We prove that at least $(k+1.5)n+\Theta(k)$ comparisons are needed in
the worst case thus disproving the conjecture that $(k+1+\epsilon)n$
comparisons are enough."
"A pseudo [2,b]-factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph in which each
component C on at least three vertices is a [2,b]-graph. The main contibution
of this paper, is to give an upper bound to the number of components that are
edges or vertices in a pseudo [2,b]-factor of a graph G. This bound is sharp."
"Let G = (V, E) be a directed acyclic graph with two distinguished vertices s,
t and let F be a set of forbidden pairs of vertices. We say that a path in G is
safe, if it contains at most one vertex from each pair {u, v} in F. Given G and
F, the path avoiding forbidden pairs (PAFP) problem is to find a safe s-t path
in G. We systematically study the complexity of different special cases of the
PAFP problem defined according to the mutual positions of forbidden pairs. Fix
one topological ordering of vertices; we say that pairs {u, v} and {x, y} are
disjoint, if u, v < x, y, nested, if u < x, y < v, and halving, if u < x < v <
y. The PAFP problem is known to be NP-hard in general or if no two pairs are
disjoint; we prove that it remains NP-hard even when no two forbidden pairs are
nested. On the other hand, if no two pairs are halving, the problem is known to
be solvable in cubic time. We simplify and improve this result by showing an
O(M(n)) time algorithm, where M(n) is the time to multiply two n \times n
boolean matrices."
"This paper aims at setting the keystone of a prospective theoretical study on
the role of non-monotone interactions in biological regulation networks.
Focusing on discrete models of these networks, namely, Boolean automata
networks, we propose to analyse the contribution of non-monotony to the
diversity and complexity in their dynamical behaviours. More precisely, in this
paper, we start by detailing some motivations, both mathematical and
biological, for our interest in non-monotony, and we discuss how it may account
for phenomena that cannot be produced by monotony only. Then, to build some
understanding in this direction, we propose some preliminary results on the
dynamical behaviour of some specific non-monotone Boolean automata networks
called XOR circulant networks."
"We study the transients of linear max-plus dynamical systems. For that, we
consider for each irreducible max-plus matrix A, the weighted graph G(A) such
that A is the adjacency matrix of G(A). Based on a novel graph-theoretic
counterpart to the number-theoretic Brauer's theorem, we propose two new
methods for the construction of arbitrarily long paths in G(A) with maximal
weight. That leads to two new upper bounds on the transient of a linear
max-plus system which both improve on the bounds previously given by Even and
Rajsbaum (STOC 1990, Theory of Computing Systems 1997), by Bouillard and Gaujal
(Research Report 2000), and by Soto y Koelemeijer (PhD Thesis 2003), and are,
in general, incomparable with Hartmann and Arguelles' bound (Mathematics of
Operations Research 1999). With our approach, we also show how to improve the
latter bound by a factor of two.
  A significant benefit of our bounds is that each of them turns out to be
linear in the size of the system in various classes of linear max-plus system
whereas the bounds previously given are all at least quadratic. Our second
result concerns the relationship between matrix and system transients: We prove
that the transient of an NxN matrix A is, up to some constant, equal to the
transient of an A-linear system with an initial vector whose norm is quadratic
in N. Finally, we study the applicability of our results to the well-known Full
Reversal algorithm whose behavior can be described as a min-plus linear system."
"We present a strengthened version of a lemma due to Bondy and Lov\'asz. This
lemma establishes the connectivity of a certain graph whose nodes correpond to
the spanning trees of a 2-vertex-connected graph, and implies the k=2 case of
the Gy\H{o}ri-Lov\'asz Theorem on partitioning of k-vertex-connected graphs.
Our strengthened version constructively proves an asymptotically tight O(|V|^2)
bound on the worst-case diameter of this graph of spanning trees."
"In this paper, we obtain complete characterization for nested canalyzing
functions (NCFs) by obtaining its unique algebraic normal form (polynomial
form). We introduce a new concept, LAYER NUMBER for NCF. Based on this, we
obtain explicit formulas for the the following important parameters: 1) Number
of all the nested canalyzing functions, 2) Number of all the NCFs with given
LAYER NUMBER, 3) Hamming weight of any NCF, 4) The activity number of any
variable of any NCF, 5) The average sensitivity of any NCF. Based on these
formulas, we show the activity number is greater for those variables in out
layer and equal in the same layer. We show the average sensitivity attains
minimal value when the NCF has only one layer. We also prove the average
sensitivity for any NCF (No matter how many variables it has) is between 0 and
2. Hence, theoretically, we show why NCF is stable since a random Boolean
function has average sensitivity $\frac{n}{2}$. Finally we conjecture that the
NCF attain the maximal average sensitivity if it has the maximal LAYER NUMBER
$n-1$. Hence, we guess the uniform upper bound for the average sensitivity of
any NCF can be reduced to 4/3 which is tight."
"We determine the exact threshold of satisfiability for random instances of a
particular NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). This is the first
random CSP model for which we have determined a precise linear satisfiability
threshold, and for which random instances with density near that threshold
appear to be computationally difficult. More formally, it is the first random
CSP model for which the satisfiability threshold is known and which shares the
following characteristics with random k-SAT for k >= 3. The problem is
NP-complete, the satisfiability threshold occurs when there is a linear number
of clauses, and a uniformly random instance with a linear number of clauses
asymptotically almost surely has exponential resolution complexity."
"Motivated by applications in bioinformatics, we consider the word collector
problem, i.e. the expected number of calls to a random weighted generator of
words of length $n$ before the full collection is obtained. The originality of
this instance of the non-uniform coupon collector lies in the, potentially
large, multiplicity of the words/coupons of a given probability/composition. We
obtain a general theorem that gives an asymptotic equivalent for the expected
waiting time of a general version of the Coupon Collector. This theorem is
especially well-suited for classes of coupons featuring high multiplicities.
Its application to a given language essentially necessitates some knowledge on
the number of words of a given composition/probability. We illustrate the
application of our theorem, in a step-by-step fashion, on three exemplary
languages, revealing asymptotic regimes in $\Theta(\mu(n)\cdot n)$ and
$\Theta(\mu(n)\cdot \log n)$, where $\mu(n)$ is the sum of weights over words
of length $n$."
"Given a graph G and integers b and w. The black-and-white coloring problem
asks if there exist disjoint sets of vertices B and W with |B|=b and |W|=w such
that no two vertices x in B and y in W are adjacent. In this paper we show that
the problem is polynomial when restricted to permutation graphs and, more
generally, to circle graphs."
"Given an undirected graph $G$ with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, and non-negative
edge weights, and given an integer $k\geq 2$, we show that a
$(2k-1)$-approximate distance oracle for $G$ of size $O(kn^{1 + 1/k})$ and with
$O(\log k)$ query time can be constructed in $O(\min\{kmn^{1/k},\sqrt km +
kn^{1 + c/\sqrt k}\})$ time for some constant $c$. This improves the $O(k)$
query time of Thorup and Zwick. Furthermore, for any $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$, we
give an oracle of size $O(kn^{1 + 1/k})$ that answers $((2 +
\epsilon)k)$-approximate distance queries in $O(1/\epsilon)$ time. At the cost
of a $k$-factor in size, this improves the $128k$ approximation achieved by the
constant query time oracle of Mendel and Naor and approaches the best possible
tradeoff between size and stretch, implied by a widely believed girth
conjecture of Erd\H{o}s. We can match the $O(n^{1 + 1/k})$ size bound of Mendel
and Naor for any constant $\epsilon > 0$ and $k = O(\log n/\log\log n)$."
"For dealing with the equal sphere packing problem, we propose a serial
symmetrical relocation algorithm, which is effective in terms of the quality of
the numerical results. We have densely packed up to 200 equal spheres in
spherical container and up to 150 equal spheres in cube container. All results
are rigorous because of a fake sphere trick. It was conjectured impossible to
pack 68 equal spheres of radius 1 into a sphere of radius 5. The serial
symmetrical relocation algorithm has proven wrong this conjecture by finding
one such packing."
"A word w is called a synchronizing word of deterministic finite automaton
(DFA) if w sends all states of the automaton to a unique state. In 1964, Jan
\v{C}erny discovered a sequence of n-state complete DFA possessing a minimal
synchronizing word of length (n-1)2. The \v{C}erny conjecture claims that it is
also the upper bound on the length of such a word for a complete DFA. The
problem has motivated great and constantly growing number of investigations and
generalizations and together with the Road Coloring problem is considered as a
most fascinating old problem in the theory of finite automata."
"A graph $G$ is called a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists an
edge-weighted tree $T$ and two non-negative real numbers $d_{min}$ and
$d_{max}$ such that each leaf $l_u$ of $T$ corresponds to a vertex $u \in V$
and there is an edge $(u,v) \in E$ if and only if $d_{min} \leq d_{T,w} (l_u,
l_v) \leq d_{max}$ where $d_{T,w} (l_u, l_v)$ is the sum of the weights of the
edges on the unique path from $l_u$ to $l_v$ in $T$.
  In this note, we show that all the graphs with at most seven vertices are
PCGs. In particular all these graphs except for the wheel on 7 vertices $W_7$
are PCGs of a particular structure of a tree: a centipede."
"Tantrix is a puzzle to make a loop by connecting lines drawn on hexagonal
tiles, and the objective of this research is to solve it by a computer. For
this purpose, we give a problem setting of solving Tantrix as arranging tiles
in an appropriate shape and making a loop at the same time within a given
hexagonal lattice board. We then formulate it as an integer program by
expressing the rules of Tantrix as its constraints, and solve it by a
mathematical programming solver to have a solution. As a result, we establish a
formulation that solves Tantrix of moderate sizes, and even when the solutions
are invalid only by elementary constraints, we achieved it by introducing
additional constraints and an artificial objective function to avoid flaws in
invalid solutions. By this approach we are successful in solving Tantrix of
size up to 50."
"Sand Pile Models are discrete dynamical systems emphasizing the phenomenon of
Self-Organized Criticality. From a configuration composed of a finite number of
stacked grains, we apply on every possible positions (in parallel) two grain
moving transition rules. The transition rules permit one grain to fall to its
right or left (symmetric) neighboring column if the difference of height
between those columns is larger than 2. The model is nondeterministic and
grains always fall downward. We propose a study of the set of fixed points
reachable in the Parallel Symmetric Sand Pile Model (PSSPM). Using a comparison
with the Symmetric Sand Pile Model (SSPM) on which rules are applied once at
each iteration, we get a continuity property. This property states that within
PSSPM we can't reach every fixed points of SSPM, but a continuous subset
according to the lexicographic order. Moreover we define a successor relation
to browse exhaustively the sets of fixed points of those models."
"Let G be a graph. Consider two nonadjacent vertices x and y that have a
common neighbor. Folding G with respect to x and y is the operation which
identifies x and y. After a maximal series of foldings the graph is a disjoint
union of cliques. The minimal clique number that can appear after a maximal
series of foldings is equal to the chromatic number of G. In this paper we
consider the problem to determine the maximal clique number which can appear
after a maximal series of foldings. We denote this number as Sigma(G) and we
call it the max-folding number. We show that the problem is NP-complete, even
when restricted to classes such as trivially perfect graphs, cobipartite graphs
and planar graphs. We show that the max-folding number of trees is two."
"Let G=(V,E) be a graph. A vertex dominates itself and all its neighbors,
i.e., every vertex v in V dominates its closed neighborhood N[v]. A vertex set
D in G is an efficient dominating (e.d.) set for G if for every vertex v in V,
there is exactly one d in D dominating v. An edge set M is an efficient edge
dominating (e.e.d.) set for G if it is an efficient dominating set in the line
graph L(G) of G. The ED problem (EED problem, respectively) asks for the
existence of an e.d. set (e.e.d. set, respectively) in the given graph.
  We give a unified framework for investigating the complexity of these
problems on various classes of graphs. In particular, we solve some open
problems and give linear time algorithms for ED and EED on dually chordal
graphs.
  We extend the two problems to hypergraphs and show that ED remains
NP-complete on alpha-acyclic hypergraphs, and is solvable in polynomial time on
hypertrees, while EED is polynomial on alpha-acyclic hypergraphs and
NP-complete on hypertrees."
"This paper proves the reconstruction conjecture for graphs which are
isomorphic to the cube of a tree. The proof uses the reconstructibility of
trees from their peripheral vertex deleted subgraphs. The main result follows
from (i) characterization of the cube of a tree (ii) recognizability of the
cube of a tree (iii) uniqueness of tree as a cube root of a graph G, except
when G is a complete graph (iv) reconstructibility of trees from their
peripheral vertex deleted subgraphs."
"Many applications motivate the distance measure between rankings, such as
comparing top-k lists and rank aggregation for voting, and intrigue great
interest to researchers. For example, for a search engine, the use of different
ranking algorithms may return different ranking lists. The effect of a ranking
algorithm can be estimated by computing the distance (similarity) between the
result ranking it returns and the appropriate ranking people expect. People may
be interested in only the first few items of result ranking, therefore the
metric for measuring the distance should emphasize on the items in higher
positions. Besides, in an extreme case, if a result ranking is the total
reverse of the expected ranking, then it is considered to be the worst ranking
with the maximum distance. Therefore, a metric is called for, which can satisfy
both of the two intuitions. To address this problem, we present a weighted
metric based on the classical Spearman's footrule metric to measure the
distance between two permutations of n objects. This metric can be applied in
rank aggregation problem with a polynomial time algorithm, and produces a
2-approximation for adopting the weighted Kendall's tau distance proposed by
Farnoud et al."
"The Frankl's conjecture, formulated in 1979. and still open, states that in
every family of sets closed for unions there is an element contained in at
least half of the sets. FC-families are families for which it is proved that
every union-closed family containing them satisfies the Frankl's condition
(e.g., in every union-closed family that contains a one-element set {a}, the
element a is contained in at least half of the sets, so families of the form
{a} are the simplest FC-families). FC-families play an important role in
attacking the Frankl's conjecture, since they enable significant search space
pruning. We present a formalization of the computer assisted approach for
proving that a family is an FC-family. Proof-by-computation paradigm is used
and the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL is used both to check mathematical
content, and to perform (verified) combinatorial searches on which the proofs
rely. FC-families known in the literature are confirmed, and a new FC-family is
discovered."
"A square is the concatenation of a nonempty word with itself. A word has
period p if its letters at distance p match. The exponent of a nonempty word is
the quotient of its length over its smallest period.
  In this article we give a proof of the fact that there exists an infinite
binary word which contains finitely many squares and simultaneously avoids
words of exponent larger than 7/3. Our infinite word contains 12 squares, which
is the smallest possible number of squares to get the property, and 2 factors
of exponent 7/3. These are the only factors of exponent larger than 2. The
value 7/3 introduces what we call the finite-repetition threshold of the binary
alphabet. We conjecture it is 7/4 for the ternary alphabet, like its repetitive
threshold."
"An open problem posed by the first author is the complexity to decide whether
a sequence of nonnegative integer numbers can be the final score of a football
tournament. In this paper we propose polynomial time approximate and
exponential time exact algorithms which solve the problem."
"In this paper, we define irregular bipolar fuzzy graphs and its various
classifications. Size of regular bipolar fuzzy graphs is derived. The relation
between highly and neighbourly irregular bipolar fuzzy graphs are established.
Some basic theorems related to the stated graphs have also been presented."
"The Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) Problem on graphs with vertex
weights asks for a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices of maximum total
weight. Being one of the most investigated and most important problems on
graphs, it is well known to be NP-complete and hard to approximate. The
complexity of MWIS is open for hole-free graphs (i.e., graphs without induced
subgraphs isomorphic to a chordless cycle of length at least five). By applying
clique separator decomposition as well as modular decomposition, we obtain
polynomial time solutions of MWIS for odd-hole- and dart-free graphs as well as
for odd-hole- and bull-free graphs (dart and bull have five vertices, say
$a,b,c,d,e$, and dart has edges $ab,ac,ad,bd,cd,de$, while bull has edges
$ab,bc,cd,be,ce$). If the graphs are hole-free instead of odd-hole-free then
stronger structural results and better time bounds are obtained."
"Linear max-plus systems describe the behavior of a large variety of complex
systems. It is known that these systems show a periodic behavior after an
initial transient phase. Assessment of the length of this transient phase
provides important information on complexity measures of such systems, and so
is crucial in system design. We identify relevant parameters in a graph
representation of these systems and propose a modular strategy to derive new
upper bounds on the length of the transient phase. By that we are the first to
give asymptotically tight and potentially subquadratic transience bounds. We
use our bounds to derive new complexity results, in particular in distributed
computing."
"Deciding whether a collection of unrooted trees is compatible is a
fundamental problem in phylogenetics. Two different graph-theoretic
characterizations of tree compatibility have recently been proposed. In one of
these, tree compatibility is characterized in terms of the existence of a
specific kind of triangulation in a structure known as the display graph. An
alternative characterization expresses the tree compatibility problem as a
chordal graph sandwich problem in a structure known as the edge label
intersection graph. In this paper we show that the characterization using edge
label intersection graphs transforms to a characterization in terms of minimal
cuts of the display graph. We show how these two characterizations are related
to compatibility of splits. We also show how the characterization in terms of
minimal cuts of display graph is related to the characterization in terms of
triangulation of the display graph."
"We propose a practical algorithm for block Korkin-Zolotarev reduction, a
concept introduced by Schnorr, using CPU arbitrary length Householder

lattices in the sense of Goldstein and Mayer."
"A biclique of a graph G is an induced complete bipartite graph. A star of G
is a biclique contained in the closed neighborhood of a vertex. A star
(biclique) k-coloring of G is a k-coloring of G that contains no monochromatic
maximal stars (bicliques). Similarly, for a list assignment L of G, a star
(biclique) L-coloring is an L-coloring of G in which no maximal star (biclique)
is monochromatic. If G admits a star (biclique) L-coloring for every k-list
assignment L, then G is said to be star (biclique) k-choosable. In this article
we study the computational complexity of the star and biclique coloring and
choosability problems. Specifically, we prove that the star (biclique)
k-coloring and k-choosability problems are \Sigma_2^p-complete and
\Pi_3^p-complete for k > 2, respectively, even when the input graph contains no
induced C_4 or K_{k+2}. Then, we study all these problems in some related
classes of graphs, including H-free graphs for every H on three vertices,
graphs with restricted diamonds, split graphs, threshold graphs, and net-free
block graphs."
"Let G and H be two cographs. We show that the problem to determine whether H
is a retract of G is NP-complete. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter
tractable when parameterized by the size of H. When restricted to the class of
threshold graphs or to the class of trivially perfect graphs, the problem
becomes tractable in polynomial time. The problem is also soluble when one
cograph is given as an induced subgraph of the other. We characterize absolute
retracts of cographs."
"We define LCL decompositions of the plane and investigate the advantages of
using such decompositions in the context of digital topology. We show that
discretization schemes based on such decompositions associate, to each LCL
tiling of the plane, the digital model preserving the local topological
structure of the object. We prove that for any LCL tiling of the plane, the
digital model is necessarily a digital 2-manifold. We show that elements of an
LCL tiling can be of an arbitrary shape and size. This feature generates a
variable density grid with a required resolution in any region of interest,
which is extremely important in medicine. Finally, we describe a simple
algorithm, which allows transforming regions of interest produced by the image
acquisition process into digital spaces with topological features of the
regions."
"This article present a concise estimate of upper and lower bound on the
cardinality containing shortest vector in a lattice reduced by block
Korkin-Zolotarev method (BKZ) for different value of the block size. Paper show
how density affect to this cardinality, in form of the ratio of shortest vector
size and sucessive minimal. Moreover we give upper estimate of cardinality for
critical and Goldstein-Mayer lattices."
"We introduce a search problem for finding a regular bi-partite graph of
maximum attainable girth for specified degree and number of vertices, by
restricting the search space using a series of mathematically rigourous
arguments from [1] and [2]. The goal of this paper is to derive the enumeration
search algorithm for finding a girth maximum (m, r) BTU, which is notation for
regular partite graph that has been introduced in [1], using the optimal
partition results from [2] as a starting point, and also understand the
structure of the search space and the computational complexity of the
algorithm."
"The goal of this paper is to derive the detailed description of the
Enumeration Based Search Algorithm from the high level description provided in
[16], analyze the experimental results from our implementation of the
Enumeration Based Search Algorithm for finding a regular bi-partite graph of
degree 3, and compare it with known results from the available literature. We
show that the values of m for a given girth g for (m, 3) BTUs are within the
known mathematical bounds for regular bi-partitite graphs from the available
literature."
"We show that the sets of periods of multidimensional shifts of finite type
(SFTs) are exactly the sets of integers of the complexity class $\NE$. We also
show that the functions counting their number are the functions of #E. We also
give characterizations of some other notions of periodicity. We finish the
paper by giving some characterizations for sofic and effective subshifts."
"To analyze the failure risk of asynchronous digital circuits the
time-parameter is introduced into the Boolean algebra replacing the arithmetic

"We study an assembly line balancing problem that occurs in sheltered worker
centers for the disabled, where workers with very different characteristics are
present. We are interested in the situation in which parallel assembly lines
are allowed and name the resulting problem as parallel assembly line worker
assignment and balancing problem. We present a linear mixed-integer formulation
and a four-stage heuristic algorithm. Computational results with a large set of
instances recently proposed in the literature show the advantages of allowing
alternative line layouts."
"This article present a parallel CPU implementation of Kannan algorithm for

"Let G be a finite undirected graph. A vertex dominates itself and all its
neighbors in G. A vertex set D is an efficient dominating set (e.d. for short)
of G if every vertex of G is dominated by exactly one vertex of D. The
Efficient Domination (ED) problem, which asks for the existence of an e.d. in
G, is known to be NP-complete even for very restricted graph classes.
  In particular, the ED problem remains NP-complete for 2P3-free graphs and
thus for P7-free graphs. We show that the weighted version of the problem
(abbreviated WED) is solvable in polynomial time on various subclasses of
2P3-free and P7-free graphs, including (P2+P4)-free graphs, P5-free graphs and
other classes.
  Furthermore, we show that a minimum weight e.d. consisting only of vertices
of degree at most 2 (if one exists) can be found in polynomial time. This
contrasts with our NP-completeness result for the ED problem on planar
bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3."
"The attempts to prove the Four Color Problem last for long years. A little
hope arises that the properties of the minimal partial triangulations will be
very useful for the solution of the Four Color Problem. That is why the
material of this paper is devoted to the examination of the specific partial
graphs and their properties. Such graphs will have all the elements of the
planar triangulation, but will have the minimal size. And it will be quite
interesting to found out their properties in order to search in the sequel for
the possibility to prove the Four Color Problem on the base of their
characteristics."
"Recent work of Brlek \textit{et al.} gives a characterization of digitally
convex polyominoes using combinatorics on words. From this work, we derive a
combinatorial symbolic description of digitally convex polyominoes and use it
to analyze their limit properties and build a uniform sampler. Experimentally,
our sampler shows a limit shape for large digitally convex polyominoes."
"The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a very important problem in
math- ematics, which has a broad application in scheduling problems, physics
and bioinformatics. It is known that the given two random sequences of infinite
lengths, the expected length of LCS will be a constant. however, the value of
this constant is not yet known. Moreover, the variance distribution of LCS
length is also not fully understood. The problem becomes more difficult when
there are (a) multiple sequences, (b) sequences with non-even distribution of
alphabets and (c) large alphabets. This work focus on these more complicated
issues. We have systematically analyze the expected length, variance and
distribution of LCS based on extensive Monte Carlo simulation. The results on
expected length are consistent with currently proved theoretical results, and
the analysis on variance and distribution provide further insights into the
problem."
"A novel polynomial expansion method of symmetric Boolean functions is
described. The method is efficient for symmetric Boolean function with small
set of valued numbers and has the linear complexity for elementary symmetric
Boolean functions, while the complexity of the known methods for this class of
functions is quadratic. The proposed method is based on the consequence of the
combinatorial Lucas theorem."
"The X-problem of number 3 for one dimension and related observations are
discussed"
"We introduce the notion of a ""random basic walk"" on an infinite graph, give
numerous examples, list potential applications, and provide detailed
comparisons between the random basic walk and existing generalizations of
simple random walks. We define analogues in the setting of random basic walks
of the notions of recurrence and transience in the theory of simple random
walks, and we study the question of which graphs have a cycling random basic
walk and which a transient random basic walk.
  We prove that cycles of arbitrary length are possible in any regular graph,
but that they are unlikely. We give upper bounds on the expected number of
vertices a random basic walk will visit on the infinite graphs studied and on
their finite analogues of sufficiently large size. We then study random basic
walks on complete graphs, and prove that the class of complete graphs has
random basic walks asymptotically visit a constant fraction of the nodes. We
end with numerous conjectures and problems for future study, as well as ideas
for how to approach these problems."
"For an undirected, simple, finite, connected graph $G$, we denote by $V(G)$
and $E(G)$ the sets of its vertices and edges, respectively. A function
$\varphi:E(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,t\}$ is called a proper edge $t$-coloring of a
graph $G$, if adjacent edges are colored differently and each of $t$ colors is
used. The least value of $t$ for which there exists a proper edge $t$-coloring
of a graph $G$ is denoted by $\chi'(G)$. For any graph $G$, and for any integer
$t$ satisfying the inequality $\chi'(G)\leq t\leq |E(G)|$, we denote by
$\alpha(G,t)$ the set of all proper edge $t$-colorings of $G$. Let us also
define a set $\alpha(G)$ of all proper edge colorings of a graph $G$: $$
\alpha(G)\equiv\bigcup_{t=\chi'(G)}^{|E(G)|}\alpha(G,t). $$
  An arbitrary nonempty finite subset of consecutive integers is called an
interval. If $\varphi\in\alpha(G)$ and $x\in V(G)$, then the set of colors of
edges of $G$ which are incident with $x$ is denoted by $S_G(x,\varphi)$ and is
called a spectrum of the vertex $x$ of the graph $G$ at the proper edge
coloring $\varphi$. If $G$ is a graph and $\varphi\in\alpha(G)$, then define
$f_G(\varphi)\equiv|\{x\in V(G)/S_G(x,\varphi) \textrm{is an interval}\}|$.
  For a graph $G$ and any integer $t$, satisfying the inequality $\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq |E(G)|$, we define: $$
\mu_1(G,t)\equiv\min_{\varphi\in\alpha(G,t)}f_G(\varphi),\qquad
\mu_2(G,t)\equiv\max_{\varphi\in\alpha(G,t)}f_G(\varphi). $$
  For any graph $G$, we set: $$ \mu_{11}(G)\equiv\min_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_1(G,t),\qquad \mu_{12}(G)\equiv\max_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_1(G,t), $$ $$ \mu_{21}(G)\equiv\min_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_2(G,t),\qquad \mu_{22}(G)\equiv\max_{\chi'(G)\leq
t\leq|E(G)|}\mu_2(G,t). $$
  For regular graphs, some relations between the $\mu$-parameters are obtained."
"Visualizing graphs using virtual physical models is probably the most heavily
used technique for drawing graphs in practice. There are many algorithms that
are efficient and produce high-quality layouts. If one requires that the layout
also respect a given set of non-uniform edge lengths, however, force-based
approaches become problematic while energy-based layouts become intractable. In
this paper, we propose a reformulation of the stress function into a two-part
convex objective function to which we can apply semi-definite programming
(SDP). We avoid the high computational cost associated with SDP by a novel,
compact re-parameterization of the objective function using the eigenvectors of
the graph Laplacian. This sparse representation makes our approach scalable. We
provide experimental results to show that this method scales well and produces
reasonable layouts while dealing with the edge length constraints."
"We present an $O(n^5)$ algorithm that computes a maximum stable set of any
perfect graph with no balanced skew-partition. We present $O(n^7)$ time
algorithm that colors them."
"A graph is unichord free if it does not contain a cycle with exactly one
chord as its subgraph. In [3], it is shown that a graph is unichord free if and
only if every minimal vertex separator is a stable set. In this paper, we first
show that such a graph can be recognized in polynomial time. Further, we show
that the chromatic number of unichord free graphs is one of (2,3, \omega(G)).
We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to produce a coloring with
\omega(G) colors."
"The rotor-router model is a deterministic process analogous to a simple
random walk on a graph. This paper is concerned with a generalized model,
functional-router model, which imitates a Markov chain possibly containing
irrational transition probabilities. We investigate the discrepancy of the
number of tokens at a single vertex between the functional-router model and its
corresponding Markov chain, and give an upper bound in terms of the mixing time
of the Markov chain."
"The manuscript generalizes several recent results of the 2nd author
concerning Markov-Chain Modelling of $(1,\lambda )$-ES Linear Optimization."
"A circular-arc hypergraph $H$ is a hypergraph admitting an arc ordering, that
is, a circular ordering of the vertex set $V(H)$ such that every hyperedge is
an arc of consecutive vertices. An arc ordering is tight if, for any two
hyperedges $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ is a nonempty subset of $B$ and $B$ is not
equal to $V(H)$, the corresponding arcs share a common endpoint. We give
sufficient conditions for $H$ to have, up to reversing, a unique arc ordering
and a unique tight arc ordering. These conditions are stated in terms of
connectedness properties of $H$.
  It is known that $G$ is a proper circular-arc graph exactly when its closed
neighborhood hypergraph $N[G]$ admits a tight arc ordering. We explore
connectedness properties of $N[G]$ and prove that, if $G$ is a connected,
twin-free, proper circular-arc graph with non-bipartite complement, then $N[G]$
has, up to reversing, a unique arc ordering. If the complement of $G$ is
bipartite and connected, then $N[G]$ has, up to reversing, two tight arc
orderings. As a corollary, we notice that in both of the two cases $G$ has an
essentially unique intersection representation. The last result also follows
from the work by Deng, Hell, and Huang based on a theory of local tournaments."
"A broadcast graph is a connected graph, $G=(V,E)$, $ |V |=n$, in which each
vertex can complete broadcasting of one message within at most $t=\lceil \log
n\rceil$ time units. A minimum broadcast graph on $n$ vertices is a broadcast
graph with the minimum number of edges over all broadcast graphs on $n$
vertices. The cardinality of the edge set of such a graph is denoted by $B(n)$.
In this paper we construct a new broadcast graph with
  $B(n) \le (k+1)N -(t-\frac{k}{2}+2)2^{k}+t-k+2$, for $n=N=(2^{k}-1)2^{t+1-k}$
and
  $B(n) \le (k+1-p)n -(t-\frac{k}{2}+p+2)2^{k}+t-k -(p-2)2^{p}$, for $2^{t} <
n<(2^{k}-1)2^{t+1-k}$, where $t \geq 7$, $2 \le k \le \lfloor t/2 \rfloor -1$
for even $n$ and $2 \le k \le \lceil t/2 \rceil -1$ for odd $n$, $d=N-n$, $x=
\lfloor \frac{d}{2^{t+1-k}} \rfloor$ and $ p = \lfloor \log_{2}{(x+1)} \rfloor$
if $x>0$ and $p=0$ if $x=0$.
  The new bound is an improvement upon the bound presented by Harutyunyan and
Liestman (2012) for odd values of $n$."
"In this article we give a new definition of direct product of two arbitrary
fuzzy graphs. We define the concepts of domination and total domination in this
new product graph. We obtain an upper bound for the total domination number of
the product fuzzy graph. Further we define the concept of total
alpha-domination number and derive a lower bound for the total domination
number of the product fuzzy graph in terms of the total alpha-domination number
of the component graphs. A lower bound for the domination number of the same
has also been found."
"Emergence is a concept that is easy to exhibit, but very hard to formally
handle. This paper is about cubic sand grains moving around on nicely packed
columns in one dimension (the physical sandpile is two dimensional, but the
support of sand columns is one dimensional). The Kadanoff Sandpile Model is a
discrete dynamical system describing the evolution of a finite number of
stacked grains --as they would fall from an hourglass-- to a stable
configuration (fixed point). Grains move according to the repeated application
of a simple local rule until reaching a fixed point. The main interest of the
model relies in the difficulty of understanding its behavior, despite the
simplicity of the rule. In this paper we prove the emergence of wave patterns
periodically repeated on fixed points. Remarkably, those regular patterns do
not cover the entire fixed point, but eventually emerge from a seemingly highly
disordered segment. The proof technique we set up associates arguments of
linear algebra and combinatorics, which interestingly allow to formally state
the emergence of regular patterns without requiring a precise understanding of
the chaotic initial segment's dynamic."
"The method for a problem solution of expenditures reduction of computing
resources and time is developed at a pattern recognition, with the way of
construction of the minimum tests sets or separate minimum tests on Boolean
matrixes is suggested"
"We define an $n$-gon to be any convex polygon with $n$ vertices. Let $V$
represent the set of vertices of the polygon. A proper $k$-coloring refers to a
function, $f$ : $V$ $\rightarrow$ $\{1, 2, 3, ... k\}$, such that for any two
vertices $u$ and $v$, if $f(u) = f(v)$, $u$ is not adjacent to $v$. The purpose
of this paper is to develop a recursive algorithm to compute the number of
proper $k$-colorings in an $n$-gon. The proposed algorithm can easily be solved
to obtain the explicit expression. This matches the explicit expression
obtained from the popular conventional solutions, which confirms the
correctness of the proposed algorithm. Often, for huge values of $n$ and $k$,
it becomes impractical to display the output numbers, which would consist of
thousands of digits. We report the answer modulo a certain number. In such
situations, the proposed algorithm is observed to run slightly faster than the
conventional recursive algorithm."
"Pairwise comparisons are a well-known method for modelling of the subjective
preferences of a decision maker. A popular implementation of the method is
based on solving an eigenvalue problem for M - the matrix of pairwise
comparisons. This does not take into account the actual values of preference.
The Heuristic Rating Estimation (HRE) approach is a modification of this method
in which allows modelling of the reference values. To determine the relative
order of preferences is to solve a certain linear equation system defined by
the matrix A and the constant term vector b (both derived from M). The article
explores the properties of these equation systems. In particular, it is proven
that for some small data inconsistency the A matrix is an M-matrix, hence the
equation proposed by the HRE approach has a unique strictly positive solution."
"The focus of this article is to develop computationally efficient
mathematical morphology operators on hypergraphs. To this aim we consider
lattice structures on hypergraphs on which we build morphological operators. We
develop a pair of dual adjunctions between the vertex set and the hyper edge
set of a hypergraph H, by defining a vertex-hyperedge correspondence. This
allows us to recover the classical notion of a dilation/erosion of a subset of
vertices and to extend it to subhypergraphs of H. Afterward, we propose several
new openings, closings, granulometries and alternate sequential filters acting
(i) on the subsets of the vertex and hyperedge set of H and (ii) on the
subhypergraphs of a hypergraph."
"The cops-and-robber (CR) game has been used in mobile robotics as a
discretized model (played on a graph G) of pursuit/evasion problems. The
""classic"" CR version is a perfect information game: the cops' (pursuer's)
location is always known to the robber (evader) and vice versa. Many variants
of the classic game can be defined: the robber can be invisible and also the
robber can be either adversarial (tries to avoid capture) or drunk (performs a
random walk). Furthermore, the cops and robber can reside in either nodes or
edges of G. Several of these variants are relevant as models or robotic pursuit
/ evasion. In this paper, we first define carefully several of the variants
mentioned above and related quantities such as the cop number and the capture
time. Then we introduce and study the cost of visibility (COV), a quantitative
measure of the increase in difficulty (from the cops' point of view) when the
robber is invisible. In addition to our theoretical results, we present
algorithms which can be used to compute capture times and COV of graphs which
are analytically intractable. Finally, we present the results of applying these
algorithms to the numerical computation of COV."
"In this article we deal with the problems of finding the disimplicial arcs of
a digraph and recognizing some interesting graph classes defined by their
existence. A diclique of a digraph is a pair $V \to W$ of sets of vertices such
that $v \to w$ is an arc for every $v \in V$ and $w \in W$. An arc $v \to w$ is
disimplicial when $N^-(w) \to N^+(v)$ is a diclique. We show that the problem
of finding the disimplicial arcs is equivalent, in terms of time and space
complexity, to that of locating the transitive vertices. As a result, an
efficient algorithm to find the bisimplicial edges of bipartite graphs is
obtained. Then, we develop simple algorithms to build disimplicial elimination
schemes, which can be used to generate bisimplicial elimination schemes for
bipartite graphs. Finally, we study two classes related to perfect disimplicial
elimination digraphs, namely weakly diclique irreducible digraphs and diclique
irreducible digraphs. The former class is associated to finite posets, while
the latter corresponds to dedekind complete finite posets."
"Consider a theatre consisting of $m$ rows each containing $n$ seats.
Theatregoers enter the theatre along aisles and pick a row which they enter
along one of its two entrances so as to occupy a seat. Assume they select their
seats uniformly and independently at random among the empty ones. A row of
seats is narrow and an occupant who is already occupying a seat is blocking
passage to new incoming theatregoers. As a consequence, occupying a specific
seat depends on the courtesy of theatregoers and their willingness to get up so
as to create free space that will allow passage to others. Thus, courtesy
facilitates and may well increase the overall seat occupancy of the theatre. We
say a theatregoer is courteous if (s)he will get up to let others pass.
Otherwise, the theatregoer is selfish. A set of theatregoers is $p$-courteous
if each theatregoer in the set is courteous with probability $p$, randomly and
independently. It is assumed that the behaviour of a theatregoer does not
change during the occupancy of the row.
  In this paper, we are interested in the following question: what is the
expected number of occupied seats as a function of the total number of seats in
a theatre, $n$, and the probability that a theatregoer is courteous, $p$? We
study and analyze interesting variants of this problem reflecting behaviour of
the theatregoers as entirely selfish, and $p$-courteous for a row of seats with
one or two entrances and as a consequence for a theatre with $m$ rows of seats
with multiple aisles. We also consider the case where seats in a row are chosen
according to the geometric distribution and the Zipf distibrution (as opposed
to the uniform distribution) and provide bounds on the occupancy of a row (and
thus the theatre) in each case."
"Biclustering has proved to be a powerful data analysis technique due to its
wide success in various application domains. However, the existing literature
presents efficient solutions only for enumerating maximal biclusters with
constant values, or heuristic-based approaches which can not find all
biclusters or even support the maximality of the obtained biclusters. Here, we
present a general family of biclustering algorithms for enumerating all maximal
biclusters with (i) constant values on rows, (ii) constant values on columns,
or (iii) coherent values. Versions for perfect and for perturbed biclusters are
provided. Our algorithms have four key properties (just the algorithm for
perturbed biclusters with coherent values fails to exhibit the first property):
they are (1) efficient (take polynomial time per pattern), (2) complete (find
all maximal biclusters), (3) correct (all biclusters attend the user-defined
measure of similarity), and (4) non-redundant (all the obtained biclusters are
maximal and the same bicluster is not enumerated twice). They are based on a
generalization of an efficient formal concept analysis algorithm called
In-Close2. Experimental results point to the necessity of having efficient
enumerative biclustering algorithms and provide a valuable insight into the
scalability of our family of algorithms and its sensitivity to user-defined
parameters."
"This is in some sense an addendum to the book Relational Mathematics by the
first-named author. It originated from work on diverse other topics during
which a lot of purely relational results with broad applicability have been
produced. These include results on domain construction with novel formulae for
existential and inverse image, a relational calculus for binary mappings, and
the development of a formally derived relational calculus of Kronecker-, strict
fork-, and strict join-operators. The many visualizations in this report make
it also a scrap- and picture book for examples."
"In this paper, it is shown that all programmes of all television channels can
be modelled as an interval graph. The programme slots are taken as the vertices
of the graph and if the time duration of two {programme slots} have non-empty
intersection, the corresponding vertices are considered to be connected by an
edge. The number of viewers of a programme is taken as the weight of the
vertex. A set of programmes that are mutually exclusive in respect of time
scheduling is called a session. We assume that a company sets the objective of
selecting the popular programmes in $k$ parallel sessions among different
channels so as to make its commercial advertisement reach the maximum number of
viewers, that is, a company selects $k$ suitable programme slots simultaneously
for advertisement. The aim of the paper is, therefore, to {help} the companies
to select the programme slots, which are mutually exclusive with respect to the
time schedule of telecasting time, in such a way that the total number of
viewers of the selected programme in $k$ parallel slots rises to the optimum
level. It is shown that the solution of this problem is obtained by solving the
maximum weight $k$-colouring problem on an interval {graph}. An algorithm is
designed to solve this just-in-time optimization problem using $O(kMn^2)$ time,
where $n$ and $M$ represent the total number of programmes of all channels and
the upper bound of the viewers of all programmes of all channels respectively.
The problem considered in this paper is a daily life problem which is modeled
by $k$-colouring problem on interval graph."
"We study generalisations of a simple, combinatorial proof of a Chernoff bound
similar to the one by Impagliazzo and Kabanets (RANDOM, 2010).
  In particular, we prove a randomized version of the hitting property of
expander random walks and apply it to obtain a concentration bound for expander
random walks which is essentially optimal for small deviations and a large
number of steps. At the same time, we present a simpler proof that still yields
a ""right"" bound settling a question asked by Impagliazzo and Kabanets.
  Next, we obtain a simple upper tail bound for polynomials with input
variables in $[0, 1]$ which are not necessarily independent, but obey a certain
condition inspired by Impagliazzo and Kabanets. The resulting bound is used by
Holenstein and Sinha (FOCS, 2012) in the proof of a lower bound for the number
of calls in a black-box construction of a pseudorandom generator from a one-way
function.
  We then show that the same technique yields the upper tail bound for the
number of copies of a fixed graph in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph,
matching the one given by Janson, Oleszkiewicz and Ruci\'nski (Israel J. Math,
2002)."
"This article present a application of Block Korkin---Zolotarev lattice

detecting by SIC."
"Especially in research areas of computer science such as data mining, image
segmentation, clustering image capturing and networking. The interval-valued
fuzzy graphs are more flexible and compatible than fuzzy graphs due to the fact
that they allowed the degree of membership of a vertex to an edge to be
represented by interval valued in [0,1] rather than the crisp real values
between 0 and 1."
"A Grundy k-coloring of a graph G, is a vertex k-coloring of G such that for
each two colors i and j with i < j, every vertex of G colored by j has a
neighbor with color i. The Grundy chromatic number (G), is the largest integer
k for which there exists a Grundy k-coloring for G. In this note we first give
an interpretation of (G) in terms of the total graph of G, when G is the
complement of a bipartite graph. Then we prove that determining the Grundy
number of the complement of bipartite graphs is an NP-Complete problem"
"A path in an edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow if no two edges of it are
colored the same. The graph $G$ is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path
between every pair of vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest path between
every pair of vertices, the graph $G$ is strongly rainbow-connected. The
minimum number of colors needed to make $G$ rainbow-connected is known as the
rainbow connection number of $G$, and is denoted by $\text{rc}(G)$. Similarly,
the minimum number of colors needed to make $G$ strongly rainbow-connected is
known as the strong rainbow connection number of $G$, and is denoted by
$\text{src}(G)$. We prove that for every $k \geq 3$, deciding whether
$\text{src}(G) \leq k$ is NP-complete for split graphs, which form a subclass
of chordal graphs. Furthermore, there exists no polynomial-time algorithm for
approximating the strong rainbow connection number of an $n$-vertex split graph
with a factor of $n^{1/2-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ unless P = NP. We
then turn our attention to block graphs, which also form a subclass of chordal
graphs. We determine the strong rainbow connection number of block graphs, and
show it can be computed in linear time. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time
characterization of bridgeless block graphs with rainbow connection number at
most 4."
"This paper describes an exact algorithm for the Equitable Coloring Problem,
based on the well known DSatur algorithm for the classic Coloring Problem with
new pruning rules specifically derived from the equity constraint.
Computational experiences show that our algorithm is competitive with those

"The Equitable Coloring Problem is a variant of the Graph Coloring Problem
where the sizes of two arbitrary color classes differ in at most one unit. This
additional condition, called equity constraints, arises naturally in several
applications. Due to the hardness of the problem, current exact algorithms can
not solve large-sized instances. Such instances must be addressed only via
heuristic methods. In this paper we present a tabu search heuristic for the
Equitable Coloring Problem. This algorithm is an adaptation of the dynamic
TabuCol version of Galinier and Hao. In order to satisfy equity constraints,
new local search criteria are given. Computational experiments are carried out
in order to find the best combination of parameters involved in the dynamic
tenure of the heuristic. Finally, we show the good performance of our heuristic
over known benchmark instances."
"The problem of the data routing management, it provides a method or a
strategy that guarantees at any time the connection between any pair of nodes
in the network. This routing method must be able to cope with frequent changes
in the topology and also other characteristics of the ad hoc network as
bandwidth, the number of links, network resources etc.. We also illustrate the
utility of the proposed algorithms: the problem of assignment or frequency
allotment in a radio network or mobile phones as in the following way: how to
attribute a frequency to every transmitter(issuer) or an unity(unit) of the
network, so that two broadcasting stations (issuers) which can interfere have
frequencies distant enough from each other ? Thus to affect the wavelengths
means finding a coloring of the graph, but because the network is not stable
and the topology is dynamic, we need a method which maintains the initial
allocation of the frequencies or to look for a new allocation to maintain the
stability of the network."
"This article presents a new approach to the real-time solution of inverse
problems on embedded systems. The class of problems addressed corresponds to
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with generalized linear constraints,
whereby the data from an array of sensors forms the forcing function. The
solution of the equation is formulated as a least squares (LS) problem with
linear constraints. The LS approach makes the method suitable for the explicit
solution of inverse problems where the forcing function is perturbed by noise.
The algebraic computation is partitioned into a initial preparatory step, which
precomputes the matrices required for the run-time computation; and the cyclic
run-time computation, which is repeated with each acquisition of sensor data.
The cyclic computation consists of a single matrix-vector multiplication, in
this manner computation complexity is known a-priori, fulfilling the definition
of a real-time computation. Numerical testing of the new method is presented on
perturbed as well as unperturbed problems; the results are compared with known
analytic solutions and solutions acquired from state-of-the-art implicit
solvers. The solution is implemented with model based design and uses only
fundamental linear algebra; consequently, this approach supports automatic code
generation for deployment on embedded systems. The targeting concept was tested
via software- and processor-in-the-loop verification on two systems with
different processor architectures. Finally, the method was tested on a
laboratory prototype with real measurement data for the monitoring of flexible
structures. The problem solved is: the real-time overconstrained reconstruction
of a curve from measured gradients. Such systems are commonly encountered in
the monitoring of structures and/or ground subsidence."
"Several authors modelled networks ad hoc by oriented or disoriented graphs,
whereby the problem of allowance (allocation) of the frequencies at the level
of the network was transformed into coloring problem of nodes in the graph.
Graph coloring is a tool to characterize the graphs. In our study, we were
interested in particular in the coloring of vertex. In this domain, a large
number of parameters of coloring were defined. A coloring for which two
neighboring summits do not have same color is called proper coloring. We
proposed to evaluate two other parameters vertex coloring maximizing the number
of colors to use: b-chromatic number and especially the number of Grundy. These
studies have focused on two types of graphs, which are the powers graphs and
Cartesian sum of graphs. In the first part, we determined borders among Grundy
for the Cartesian sum of graphs and finally we proposed algorithms for the
coloration of graphs. First of all, we gave some properties and results for
simple graphs (stable, chain, cycle, full, star, bipartisan). Secondly, we
studied the Cartesian sum of two graphs by giving exact values of the number of
Grundy for diverse classes of graphs (sum of a chain and a chain, a chain and a
cycle, a cycle and a cycle) then we estimated borders of this parameter for the
sum of a complete graph and any other graph. In the second part, we presented
the results of the Cartesian sum of several graphs and in the last part; we
also gave an algorithm for generating graphs with a given number of Grundy.
Thereafter, we studied another parameter namely the partial coloring Grundy.
The properties of this parameter are close to those of total Grundy. Finally,
we used parameters of coloring total Grundy and partial Grundy to generate
algorithms of coloring of graphs. We proposed algorithms of coloring basing on
the properties of certain graphs."
"The broadcasting models on trees arise in many contexts such as discrete
mathematics, biology statistical physics and cs. In this work, we consider the
colouring model. A basic question here is whether the root's assignment affects
the distribution of the colourings at the vertices at distance h from the root.
This is the so-called ""reconstruction problem"". For a d-ary tree it is well
known that d/ln (d) is the reconstruction threshold. That is, for
k=(1+eps)d/ln(d) we have non-reconstruction while for k=(1-eps)d/ln(d) we have.
  Here, we consider the largely unstudied case where the underlying tree is
chosen according to a predefined distribution. In particular, our focus is on
the well-known Galton-Watson trees. This model arises naturally in many
contexts, e.g. the theory of spin-glasses and its applications on random
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (rCSP). The aforementioned study focuses on
Galton-Watson trees with offspring distribution B(n,d/n), i.e. the binomial
with parameters n and d/n, where d is fixed. Here we consider a broader version
of the problem, as we assume general offspring distribution, which includes
B(n,d/n) as a special case.
  Our approach relates the corresponding bounds for (non)reconstruction to
certain concentration properties of the offspring distribution. This allows to
derive reconstruction thresholds for a very wide family of offspring
distributions, which includes B(n,d/n). A very interesting corollary is that
for distributions with expected offspring d, we get reconstruction threshold
d/ln(d) under weaker concentration conditions than what we have in B(n,d/n).
  Furthermore, our reconstruction threshold for the random colorings of
Galton-Watson with offspring B(n,d/n), implies the reconstruction threshold for
the random colourings of G(n,d/n)."
"We consider the problem of deterministically factoring a univariate
polynomial over a finite field under the assumption of the Extended Riemann
Hypothesis (ERH). This work builds upon the line of approach first explored by
Gao in $2001$. The general approach has been to implicitly construct a graph
with the roots as vertices and the edges formed by some polynomial time
computable relation. The algorithm then fails to factor a polynomial if this
associated graph turns out to be \emph{regular}. In the first part of our work
we strengthen the edge relation so that the resulting set of graphs we obtain
are subgraphs of Gao's graphs, all of which must be \emph{regular}.
  In the second part of our work we strengthen the regularity condition of
these graphs. This is accomplished by finding a parallel between their
algorithms and the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm for solving the
Graph Isomorphism problem. We observe that the general principle behind their
algorithms is to separate the roots by computing the $1$-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Leman approximation to the orbits of this graph. This leads us to
the natural question of whether this approximation may be improved. We then go
on to show how to implicitly compute the $2$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman
approximation of the orbits of these graphs. The polynomials that our algorithm
fails to factor form graphs that are \emph{strongly regular} and their set of
adjacency matrices forms a combinatorial structure called an \emph{Association
scheme}."
"Intuitionistic fuzzy relations on finite universes can be represent by
intuitionistic fuzzy matrices and the
  limiting behavior of the power matrices depends on the algebraic operation
employed on the matrices. In this
  paper, the power of intuitionistic fuzzy matrices with maxgeneralized
mean-mingeneralized mean operation have
  been studied. Here it is shown that the power of intuitionistic fuzzy
matrices with the said operations are
  always convergent. The convergence of powers for an intuitionistic fuzzy
matrix with convex combination of
  max-min and maxarithmetic mean-minarithmetic mean are also dicussed here."
"According to the Erd\H{o}s discrepancy conjecture, for any infinite $\pm 1$
sequence, there exists a homogeneous arithmetic progression of unbounded
discrepancy. In other words, for any $\pm 1$ sequence $(x_1,x_2,...)$ and a
discrepancy $C$, there exist integers $m$ and $d$ such that $|\sum_{i=1}^m x_{i
\cdot d}| > C$. This is an $80$-year-old open problem and recent development
proved that this conjecture is true for discrepancies up to $2$. Paul Erd\H{o}s
also conjectured that this property of unbounded discrepancy even holds for the
restricted case of completely multiplicative sequences (CMSs), namely sequences
$(x_1,x_2,...)$ where $x_{a \cdot b} = x_{a} \cdot x_{b}$ for any $a,b \geq 1$.
The longest CMS with discrepancy $2$ has been proven to be of size $246$. In
this paper, we prove that any completely multiplicative sequence of size
$127,646$ or more has discrepancy at least $4$, proving the Erd\H{o}s
discrepancy conjecture for CMSs of discrepancies up to $3$. In addition, we
prove that this bound is tight and increases the size of the longest known
sequence of discrepancy $3$ from $17,000$ to $127,645$. Finally, we provide
inductive construction rules as well as streamlining methods to improve the
lower bounds for sequences of higher discrepancies."
"Let $G$ be a finite undirected graph. A vertex {\em dominates} itself and all
its neighbors in $G$. A vertex set $D$ is an {\em efficient dominating set}
(\emph{e.d.}\ for short) of $G$ if every vertex of $G$ is dominated by exactly
one vertex of $D$. The \emph{Efficient Domination} (ED) problem, which asks for
the existence of an e.d.\ in $G$, is known to be \NP-complete even for very
restricted graph classes such as for claw-free graphs, for chordal graphs and
for $2P_3$-free graphs (and thus, for $P_7$-free graphs). We call a graph $F$ a
{\em linear forest} if $F$ is cycle- and claw-free, i.e., its components are
paths. Thus, the ED problem remains \NP-complete for $F$-free graphs, whenever
$F$ is not a linear forest. Let WED denote the vertex-weighted version of the
ED problem asking for an e.d. of minimum weight if one exists.
  In this paper, we show that WED is solvable in polynomial time for
$(P_5+kP_2)$-free graphs for every fixed $k$, which solves an open problem,
and, using modular decomposition, we improve known time bounds for WED on
$(P_4+P_2)$-free graphs, $(P_6,S_{1,2,2})$-free graphs, and on
$(2P_3,S_{1,2,2})$-free graphs and simplify proofs. For $F$-free graphs, the
only remaining open case is WED on $P_6$-free graphs."
"An L(2,1)-labelling of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is $\lambda_{2,1}(G)$ a function
$f$ from the vertex set V (G) to the set of non-negative integers such that
adjacent vertices get numbers at least two apart, and vertices at distance two
get distinct numbers. The L(2,1)-labelling number denoted by $\lambda_{2,1}(G)$
of $G$ is the minimum range of labels over all such labelling. In this article,
it is shown that, for a circular-arc graph $G$, the upper bound of
$\lambda_{2,1}(G)$ is $\Delta+3\omega$, where $\Delta$ and $\omega$ represents
the maximum degree of the vertices and size of maximum clique respectively."
"In this paper, we define irregular interval-valued fuzzy graphs and their
various classifications. Size of regular interval-valued fuzzy graphs is
derived. The relation between highly and neighbourly irregular interval-valued
fuzzy graphs are established. Some basic theorems related to the stated graphs
have also been presented."

"In a graph, a spanning tree is said to be a tree t-spanner of the graph if
the distance between any two vertices in is at most times their distance in .
The tree t-spanner has many applications in networks and distributed
environments. In this paper, an algorithm is presented to find a tree -spanner
on trapezoid graphs in time, where is the number of vertices of the graph."
"A perfect matching in an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of vertex
disjoint edges from $E$ that include all vertices in $V$. The perfect matching
problem is to decide if $G$ has such a matching. Recently Rothvo{\ss} proved
the striking result that the Edmonds' matching polytope has exponential
extension complexity. Here for each $n=|V|$ we describe a perfect matching
polytope that is different from Edmonds' polytope and define a weaker notion of
extended formulation. We show that the new polytope has a weak extended
formulation (WEF) $Q$ of polynomial size. For each graph $G$ with $n$ vertices
we can readily construct an objective function so that solving the resulting
linear program over $Q$ decides whether or not $G$ has a perfect matching. The
construction is uniform in the sense that, for each $n$, a single polytope is
defined for the class of all graphs with $n$ nodes. The method extends to solve
poly time optimization problems, such as the weighted matching problem. In this
case a logarithmic (in the weight of the optimum solution) number of
optimizations are made over the constructed WEF.
  The method described in the paper involves construction of a compiler that
converts an algorithm given in a prescribed pseudocode into a polytope. It can
therefore be used to construct a polytope for any decision problem in {\bf P}
which can be solved by a given algorithm. Compared with earlier results of
Dobkin-Lipton-Reiss and Valiant our method allows the construction of explicit
linear programs directly from algorithms written for a standard register model,
without intermediate transformations. We apply our results to obtain polynomial
upper bounds on the non-negative rank of certain slack matrices related to
membership testing of languages in {\bf P/Poly}."
"Different graph generalizations have been recently used in an ad-hoc manner
to represent multilayer networks, i.e. systems formed by distinct layers where
each layer can be seen as a network. Similar constructions have also been used
to represent time-varying networks. We introduce the concept of MultiAspect
Graph (MAG) as a graph generalization that we prove to be isomorphic to a
directed graph, and also capable of representing all previous generalizations.
In our proposal, the set of vertices, layers, time instants, or any other
independent features are considered as an aspect of the MAG. For instance, a
MAG is able to represent multilayer or time-varying networks, while both
concepts can also be combined to represent a multilayer time-varying network
and even other higher-order networks. Since the MAG structure admits an
arbitrary (finite) number of aspects, it hence introduces a powerful modelling
abstraction for networked complex systems. This paper formalizes the concept of
MAG and derives theoretical results useful in the analysis of complex networked
systems modelled using the proposed MAG abstraction. We also present an
overview of the MAG applicability."
"An \emph{arithmetic read-once formula} (ROF for short) is a formula (i.e. a
tree of computation) in which the operations are $\{+,\times\}$ and such that
every input variable labels at most one leaf. We give a simple characterization
of such formulae. Other than being interesting in its own right, our
characterization gives rise to a property testing algorithm for functions
computable by such formulae. To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work no
characterization and/or property testing algorithm was known for this kind of
formulae."
"We consider the unrestricted, minimal, and bounded representation problems
for unit interval (UIG) and unit circular-arc (UCA) graphs. In the unrestricted
version, a proper circular-arc (PCA) model $\cal M$ is given and the goal is to
obtain an equivalent UCA model $\cal U$. We show a linear time algorithm with
negative certification that can also be implemented to run in logspace. In the
bounded version, $\cal M$ is given together with some lower and upper bounds
that the beginning points of $\cal U$ must satisfy. We develop a linear space
$O(n^2)$ time algorithm for this problem. Finally, in the minimal version, the
circumference of the circle and the length of the arcs in $\cal U$ must be
simultaneously as minimum as possible. We prove that every UCA graph admits
such a minimal model, and give a polynomial time algorithm to find it. We also
consider the minimal representation problem for UIG graphs. As a bad result, we
show that the previous linear time algorithm fails to provide a minimal model
for some input graphs. We fix this algorithm but, unfortunately, it runs in
linear space $O(n^2)$ time. Finally, we apply the minimal representation
algorithms so as to find the minimum powers of paths and cycles that contain a
given UIG and UCA models, respectively."
"A cactus graph is a connected graph in which every block is either an edge or
a cycle. In this paper, we consider several problems of graph theory and
developed optimal algorithms to solve such problems on cactus graphs. The
running time of these algorithms is O(n), where n is the total number of
vertices of the graph. The cactus graph has many applications in real life
problems, especially in radio communication system."
"We consider the problem of identifying a subset of nodes in a network that
will enable the fastest spread of information in a decentralized environment.In
a model of communication based on a random walk on an undirected graph, the
optimal set over all sets of the same or smaller cardinality minimizes the sum
of the mean first arrival times to the set by walkers starting at nodes outside
the set. The problem originates from the study of the spread of information or
consensus in a network and was introduced in this form by V.Borkar et al. in
2010. More generally, the work of A. Clark et al. in 2012 showed that
estimating the fastest rate of convergence to consensus of so-called leader
follower systems leads to a consideration of the same optimization problem.
  The set function $F$ to be minimized is supermodular and therefore the greedy
algorithm is commonly used to construct optimal sets or their approximations.
In this paper, the problem is reformulated so that the search for solutions is
restricted to optimal and near optimal subsets of the graph. We prove
sufficient conditions for the existence of a greedoid structure that contains
feasible optimal and near optimal sets. It is therefore possible we conjecture,
to search for optimal or near optimal sets by local moves in a stepwise manner
to obtain near optimal sets that are better approximations than the factor
$(1-1/e)$ degree of optimality guaranteed by the use of the greedy algorithm. A
simple example illustrates aspects of the method."
"A biclique of a graph $G$ is a maximal induced complete bipartite subgraph of
$G$. The biclique graph of $G$ denoted by $KB(G)$, is the intersection graph of
all the bicliques of $G$. The biclique graph can be thought as an operator
between graphs. The iterated biclique graph of $G$ denoted by $KB^{k}(G)$, is
the graph obtained by applying the biclique operator $k$ successive times to
$G$. The associated problem is deciding whether an input graph converges,
diverges or is periodic under the biclique operator when $k$ grows to infinity.
All possible behaviors were characterized recently and an $O(n^4)$ algorithm
for deciding the behavior of any graph under the biclique operator was also
given. In this work we prove new structural results of biclique graphs. In
particular, we prove that every false-twin-free graph with at least $13$
vertices is divergent. These results lead to a linear time algorithm to solve
the same problem."
"An efficient dominating set (or perfect code) in a graph is a set of vertices
the closed neighborhoods of which partition the vertex set of the graph. The
minimum weight efficient domination problem is the problem of finding an
efficient dominating set of minimum weight in a given vertex-weighted graph;
the maximum weight efficient domination problem is defined similarly. We
develop a framework for solving the weighted efficient domination problems
based on a reduction to the maximum weight independent set problem in the
square of the input graph. Using this approach, we improve on several previous
results from the literature by deriving polynomial-time algorithms for the
weighted efficient domination problems in the classes of dually chordal and
AT-free graphs. In particular, this answers a question by Lu and Tang regarding
the complexity of the minimum weight efficient domination problem in strongly
chordal graphs."
"Exploring the power of linear programming for combinatorial optimization
problems has been recently receiving renewed attention after a series of
breakthrough impossibility results. From an algorithmic perspective, the
related questions concern whether there are compact formulations even for
problems that are known to admit polynomial-time algorithms.
  We propose a framework for proving lower bounds on the size of extended
formulations. We do so by introducing a specific type of extended relaxations
that we call product relaxations and is motivated by the study of the
Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy. Then we show that for every approximate
relaxation of a polytope P, there is a product relaxation that has the same
size and is at least as strong. We provide a methodology for proving lower
bounds on the size of approximate product relaxations by lower bounding the
chromatic number of an underlying hypergraph, whose vertices correspond to
gap-inducing vectors.
  We extend the definition of product relaxations and our methodology to mixed
integer sets. However in this case we are able to show that mixed product
relaxations are at least as powerful as a special family of extended
formulations. As an application of our method we show an exponential lower
bound on the size of approximate mixed product formulations for the metric
capacitated facility location problem, a problem which seems to be intractable
for linear programming as far as constant-gap compact formulations are
concerned."
"We explore relations between various variational problems for graphs like
Euler characteristic chi(G), characteristic length mu(G), mean clustering
nu(G), inductive dimension iota(G), edge density epsilon(G), scale measure
sigma(G), Hilbert action eta(G) and spectral complexity xi(G). A new insight in
this note is that the local cluster coefficient C(x) in a finite simple graph
can be written as a relative characteristic length L(x) of the unit sphere S(x)
within the unit ball B(x) of a vertex. This relation L(x) = 2-C(x) will allow
to study clustering in more general metric spaces like Riemannian manifolds or
fractals. If eta is the average of scalar curvature s(x), a formula mu ~
1+log(epsilon)/log(eta) of Newman, Watts and Strogatz relates mu with the edge
density epsilon and average scalar curvature eta telling that large curvature
correlates with small characteristic length. Experiments show that the
statistical relation mu ~ log(1/nu) holds for random or deterministic
constructed networks, indicating that small clustering is often associated to
large characteristic lengths and lambda=mu/log(nu) can converge in some graph
limits of networks. Mean clustering nu, edge density epsilon and curvature
average eta therefore can relate with characteristic length mu on a statistical
level. We also discovered experimentally that inductive dimension iota and
cluster-length ratio lambda correlate strongly on Erdos-Renyi probability
spaces."
"A graph is inductive $k$-independent if there exists and ordering of its
vertices $v_{1},...,v_{n}$ such that $\alpha(G[N(v_{i})\cap V_{i}])\leq k $
where $N(v_{i})$ is the neighborhood of $v_{i}$, $V_{i}=\{v_{i},...,v_{n}\}$
and $\alpha$ is the independence number. In this article, by answering to a
question of [Y.Ye, A.Borodin, Elimination graphs, ACM Trans. Algorithms 8 (2)
(2012) 14:1-14:23], we design a polynomial time approximation algorithm with
ratio {$\overline{\Delta} \slash log(log(\overline{ \Delta}) \slash k)$ for the
maximum clique and also show that the decision version of this problem is fixed
parameter tractable for this particular family of graphs with complexity
$O(1.2127^{(p+k-1)^{k}}n)$. Then we study a subclass of inductive
$k$-independent graphs, namely $k$-degenerate graphs. A graph is $k$-degenerate
if there exists an ordering of its vertices $v_{1},...,v_{n}$ such that
$|N(v_{i})\cap V_{i}|\leq k $. Our contribution is an algorithm computing a
maximum clique for this class of graphs in time $O(1.2127^{k}(n-k+1))$, thus
improving previous best results. We also prove some structural properties for
inductive $k$-independent graphs."
"Getting a labeling of vertices close to the structure of the graph has been
proved to be of interest in many applications e.g., to follow smooth signals
indexed by the vertices of the network. This question can be related to a graph
labeling problem known as the cyclic bandwidth sum problem. It consists in
finding a labeling of the vertices of an undirected and unweighted graph with
distinct integers such that the sum of (cyclic) difference of labels of
adjacent vertices is minimized. Although theoretical results exist that give
optimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum for standard graphs, there are neither
results in the general case, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result.
In addition to this lack of theoretical knowledge, only a few methods have been
proposed to approximately solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new
heuristic to find an approximate solution for the cyclic bandwidth sum problem,
by following the structure of the graph. The heuristic is a two-step algorithm:
the first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which
follow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the
Jaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the
merging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a
partial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the
cyclic bandwidth sum. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, both in
terms of performance and time execution, is shown through experiments on graphs
whose optimal value of CBS is known as well as on real-world networks, where
the consistence between labeling and topology is highlighted. An extension to
weighted graphs is also proposed."
"We investigate the problem of modifying a graph into a connected graph in
which the degree of each vertex satisfies a prescribed parity constraint. Let
$ea$, $ed$ and $vd$ denote the operations edge addition, edge deletion and
vertex deletion respectively. For any $S\subseteq \{ea,ed,vd\}$, we define
Connected Degree Parity Editing$(S)$ (CDPE($S$)) to be the problem that takes
as input a graph $G$, an integer $k$ and a function $\delta\colon
V(G)\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, and asks whether $G$ can be modified into a connected
graph $H$ with $d_{H}(v)\equiv\delta(v)~(\bmod~2)$ for each $v\in V(H)$, using
at most $k$ operations from $S$. We prove that
  1. if $S=\{ea\}$ or $S=\{ea,ed\}$, then CDPE($S$) can be solved in polynomial
time;
  2. if $\{vd\} \subseteq S\subseteq \{ea,ed,vd\}$, then CDPE($S$) is
NP-complete and W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k$, even if $\delta\equiv 0$.
  Together with known results by Cai and Yang and by Cygan, Marx, Pilipczuk,
Pilipczuk and Schlotter, our results completely classify the classical and
parameterized complexity of the CDPE($S$) problem for all $S\subseteq
\{ea,ed,vd\}$. We obtain the same classification for a natural variant of the
CDPE($S$) problem on directed graphs, where the target is a weakly connected
digraph in which the difference between the in- and out-degree of every vertex
equals a prescribed value. As an important implication of our results, we
obtain polynomial-time algorithms for the Eulerian Editing problem and its
directed variant."
"For a set $A$ of $n$ people and a set $B$ of $m$ items, with each person
having a preference list that ranks all items from most wanted to least wanted,
we consider the problem of matching every person with a unique item. A matching
$M$ is called $\epsilon$-popular if for any other matching $M'$, the number of
people who prefer $M'$ to $M$ is at most $\epsilon n$ plus the number of those
who prefer $M$ to $M'$. In 2006, Mahdian showed that when randomly generating
people's preference lists, if $m/n > 1.42$, then a 0-popular matching exists
with $1-o(1)$ probability; and if $m/n < 1.42$, then a 0-popular matching
exists with $o(1)$ probability. The ratio 1.42 can be viewed as a transition
point, at which the probability rises from asymptotically zero to
asymptotically one, for the case $\epsilon=0$. In this paper, we introduce an
upper bound and a lower bound of the transition point in more general cases. In
particular, we show that when randomly generating each person's preference
list, if $\alpha(1-e^{-1/\alpha}) > 1-\epsilon$, then an $\epsilon$-popular
matching exists with $1-o(1)$ probability (upper bound); and if
$\alpha(1-e^{-(1+e^{1/\alpha})/\alpha}) < 1-2\epsilon$, then an
$\epsilon$-popular matching exists with $o(1)$ probability (lower bound)."
"One of the questions addressed here is How can a twisted thread correct
itself?. We consider a theoretical model where the studied mathematical object
represents a 2D twisted discrete thread linking two points. This thread is made
of a chain of agents which are lost, i.e. they have no knowledge of the global
setting and no sense of direction. Thus, the modifications made by the agents
are local and all the decisions use only minimal information about the local
neighborhood. We introduce a random process such that the thread reorganizes
itself efficiently to become a discrete line between these two points. The
second question addressed here is to reorder a word by local flips in order to
scatter the letters to avoid long successions of the same letter. These two
questions are equivalent. The work presented here is at the crossroad of many
different domains such as modeling cooling process in crystallography [2, 3,
8], stochastic cellular automata [6, 7], organizing a line of robots in
distributed algorithms (the robot chain problem [5, 11]), and Christoffel words
in language theory [1]."
"We developed a procedure of reducing the number of vertices and edges of a
given tree, which we call the ""tree simplification procedure,"" without changing
its topological information. Our motivation for developing this procedure was
to reduce computational costs of graph Laplacian eigenvalues of such trees.
When we applied this procedure to a set of trees representing dendritic
structures of retinal ganglion cells of a mouse and computed their graph
Laplacian eigenvalues, we observed two ""plateaux"" (i.e., two sets of multiple
eigenvalues) in the eigenvalue distribution of each such simplified tree. In
this article, after describing our tree simplification procedure, we analyze
why such eigenvalue plateaux occur in a simplified tree, and explain such
plateaux can occur in a more general graph if it satisfies a certain condition,
identify these two eigenvalues specifically as well as the lower bound to their
multiplicity."
"Given an undirected graph, each of the two end-vertices of an edge can own
the edge. Call a vertex poor, if it owns at most one edge. We give a polynomial
time algorithm for the problem of finding an assignment of owners to the edges
which minimizes the number of poor vertices. In the terminology of graph
orientation, this means finding an orientation for the edges of a graph
minimizing the number of edges with out-degree at most 1, and answers a
question of Asahiro Jansson, Miyano, Ono (2014)."
"We study the following geometry problem: given a $2^n-1$ dimensional vector
$\pi=\{\pi_S\}_{S\subseteq [n], S\ne \emptyset}$, is there an object
$T\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\log(\mathsf{vol}(T_S))= \pi_S$, for all
$S\subseteq [n]$, where $T_S$ is the projection of $T$ to the subspace spanned
by the axes in $S$? If $\pi$ does correspond to an object in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we
say that $\pi$ is {\em constructible}. We use $\Psi_n$ to denote the
constructible region, i.e., the set of all constructible vectors in
$\mathbb{R}^{2^n-1}$. In 1995, Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason showed that $\Psi_n$
is contained in a polyhedral cone, defined a class of so called uniform cover
inequalities. We propose a new set of natural inequalities, called
nonuniform-cover inequalities, which generalize the BT inequalities. We show
that any linear inequality that all points in $\Psi_n$ satisfy must be a
nonuniform-cover inequality. Based on this result and an example by
Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason, we show that constructible region $\Psi_n$ is not
even convex, and thus cannot be fully characterized by linear inequalities. We
further show that some subclasses of the nonuniform-cover inequalities are not
correct by various combinatorial constructions, which refutes a previous
conjecture about $\Psi_n$. Finally, we conclude with an interesting conjecture
regarding the convex hull of $\Psi_n$."
"Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$. For every $v\in V(G)$, let $E_G(v)$ denote
the set of all edges incident with $v$. A signed $k$-submatching of $G$ is a
function $f:E(G)\longrightarrow \{-1,1\}$, satisfying $f(E_G(v))\leq 1$ for at
least $k$ vertices, where $f(S)=\sum_{e\in S}f(e)$, for each $ S\subseteq
E(G)$. The maximum of the value of $f(E(G))$, taken over all signed
$k$-submatching $f$ of $G$, is called the signed $k$-submatching number and is
denoted by $\beta ^k_S(G)$. In this paper, we prove that for every graph $G$ of
order $n$ and for any positive integer $k \leq n$, $\beta ^k_S (G) \geq n-k -
\omega(G)$, where $w(G)$ is the number of components of $G$. This settles a
conjecture proposed by Wang. Also, we present a formula for the computation of
$\beta_S^n(G)$."
"In this paper, we propose algorithms for the graph isomorphism (GI) problem
that are based on the eigendecompositions of the adjacency matrices. The
eigenvalues of isomorphic graphs are identical. However, two graphs $ G_A $ and
$ G_B $ can be isospectral but non-isomorphic. We first construct a graph
isomorphism testing algorithm for friendly graphs and then extend it to
unambiguous graphs. We show that isomorphisms can be detected by solving a
linear assignment problem. If the graphs possess repeated eigenvalues, which
typically correspond to graph symmetries, finding isomorphisms is much harder.
By repeatedly perturbing the adjacency matrices and by using properties of
eigenpolytopes, it is possible to break symmetries of the graphs and
iteratively assign vertices of $ G_A $ to vertices of $ G_B $, provided that an
admissible assignment exists. This heuristic approach can be used to construct
a permutation which transforms $ G_A $ into $ G_B $ if the graphs are
isomorphic. The methods will be illustrated with several guiding examples."
"Spectral methods have proven to be a highly effective tool in understanding
the intrinsic geometry of a high-dimensional data set $\left\{x_i
\right\}_{i=1}^{n} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. The key ingredient is the
construction of a Markov chain on the set, where transition probabilities
depend on the distance between elements, for example where for every $1 \leq j
\leq n$ the probability of going from $x_j$ to $x_i$ is proportional to $$
p_{ij} \sim \exp \left( -\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\|x_i
-x_j\|^2_{\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^d)}\right) \qquad
\mbox{where}~\varepsilon>0~\mbox{is a free parameter}.$$ We propose a method
which increases the self-consistency of such Markov chains before spectral
methods are applied. Instead of directly using a Markov transition matrix $P$,
we set $p_{ii} = 0$ and rescale, thereby obtaining a transition matrix $P^*$
modeling a non-lazy random walk. We then create a new transition matrix $Q =
(q_{ij})_{i,j=1}^{n}$ by demanding that for fixed $j$ the quantity $q_{ij}$ be
proportional to $$ q_{ij} \sim \min((P^*)_{ij}, ((P^*)^2)_{ij}, \dots,
((P^*)^k)_{ij}) \qquad \mbox{where usually}~ k=2.$$ We consider several
classical data sets, show that this simple method can increase the efficiency
of spectral methods and prove that it can correct randomly introduced errors in
the kernel."
"Spiders are arthropods that can be distinguished from their closest
relatives, the insects, by counting their legs. Spiders have 8, insects just 6.
Spider graphs are a very restricted class of graphs that naturally appear in
the context of cograph editing. The vertex set of a spider (or its complement)
is naturally partitioned into a clique (the body), an independent set (the
legs), and a rest (serving as the head). Here we show that spiders can be
recognized directly from their degree sequences through the number of their
legs (vertices with degree 1). Furthermore, we completely characterize the
degree sequences of spiders."
"In this paper, we discover that any univariate Niho bent function is a sum of
functions having the form of Leander-Kholosha bent functions with extra
coefficients of the power terms. This allows immediately, knowing the terms of
an o-polynomial, to obtain the powers of the additive terms in the polynomial
representing corresponding bent function. However, the coefficients are
calculated ambiguously. The explicit form is given for the bent functions
obtained from quadratic and cubic o-polynomials. We also calculate the
algebraic degree of any bent function in the Leander-Kholosha class."
"Berwanger et al. show that for every graph $G$ of size $n$ and DAG-width $k$
there is a DAG decomposition of width $k$ and size $n^{O(k)}$. This gives a
polynomial time algorithm for determining the DAG-width of a graph for any
fixed $k$. However, if the DAG-width of the graphs from a class is not bounded,
such algorithms become exponential. This raises the question whether we can
always find a DAG decomposition of size polynomial in $n$ as it is the case for
tree width and all generalisations of tree width similar to DAG-width.
  We show that there is an infinite class of graphs such that every DAG
decomposition of optimal width has size super-polynomial in $n$ and, moreover,
there is no polynomial size DAG decomposition which would approximate an
optimal decomposition up to an additive constant.
  In the second part we use our construction to prove that deciding whether the
DAG-width of a given graph is at most a given constant is PSPACE-complete."
"We study the {\sc Clique} problem in classes of intersection graphs of convex
sets in the plane. The problem is known to be NP-complete in convex-set
intersection graphs and straight-line-segment intersection graphs, but solvable
in polynomial time in intersection graphs of homothetic triangles. We extend
the latter result by showing that for every convex polygon $P$ with sides
parallel to $k$ directions, every $n$-vertex graph which is an intersection
graph of homothetic copies of $P$ contains at most $n^{k}$ inclusion-wise
maximal cliques. We actually prove this result for a more general class of
graphs, the so called $k_{\text{DIR}}-\text{CONV}$, which are intersection
graphs of convex polygons whose sides are parallel to some fixed $k$
directions. Moreover, we provide some lower bounds on the numbers of maximal
cliques, discuss the complexity of recognizing these classes of graphs and
present a relationship with other classes of convex-set intersection graphs.
Finally, we generalize the upper bound on the number of maximal cliques to
intersection graphs of higher-dimensional convex polytopes in Euclidean space."
"We study the Neighbor Aided Network Installation Problem (NANIP) introduced
previously which asks for a minimal cost ordering of the vertices of a graph,
where the cost of visiting a node is a function of the number of neighbors that
have already been visited. This problem has applications in resource management
and disaster recovery. In this paper we analyze the computational hardness of
NANIP. In particular we show that this problem is NP-hard even when restricted
to convex decreasing cost functions, give a linear approximation lower bound
for the greedy algorithm, and prove a general sub-constant approximation lower
bound. Then we give a new integer programming formulation of NANIP and
empirically observe its speedup over the original integer program."
"We present a new, dynamical way to study powers (that is, repetitions) in
Sturmian words based on results from Diophantine approximation theory. As a
result, we provide an alternative and shorter proof of a result by Damanik and
Lenz characterizing powers in Sturmian words [Powers in Sturmian sequences,
Eur. J. Combin. 24 (2003), 377--390]. Further, as a consequence, we obtain a
previously known formula for the fractional index of a Sturmian word based on
the continued fraction expansion of its slope."
"Different Boolean networks may reveal similar dynamics although their
definition differs, then preventing their distinction from the observations.
This raises the question about the sufficiency of a particular Boolean network
for properly reproducing a modeled phenomenon to make realistic predictions.
The question actually depends on the invariant properties of behaviorally
similar Boolean networks. In this article, we address this issue by considering
that the similarity is formalized by isomorphism on graphs modeling their
dynamics. The similarity also depends on the parameter governing the updating
policy, called the mode. We define a general characterization of the group of
isomorphism preserving the mode. From this characterization, we deduce
invariant structural properties of the interaction graph and conditions to
maintain an equivalence through mode variation."
"This paper presents the classification of digital n-manifolds based on the
notion of complexity and homotopy equivalence. We introduce compressed
n-manifolds and study their properties. We show that any n-manifold with p
points is homotopy equivalent to a compressed n-manifold with m points, m<p. We
design an algorithm for the classification of digital n-manifolds of any
dimension n."
"A necessary and sufficient condition is found for a graph $G$, which
satisfies the equality $\mu_{21}(G)=|V(G)|$."
"In this paper we modify an algorithm for updating a maximal clique
enumeration after an edge insertion to provide an algorithm that runs in linear
time with respect to the number of cliques containing one of the edge's
endpoints, whereas existing algorithms take quadratic time."
"We develop a new notion called $(1-\epsilon)$-tester for a set $M$ of
functions $f:A\to C$. A $(1-\epsilon)$-tester for $M$ maps each element $a\in
A$ to a finite number of elements $B_a=\{b_1,\ldots,b_t\}\subset B$ in a
smaller sub-domain $B\subset A$ where for every $f\in M$ if $f(a)\not=0$ then
$f(b)\not=0$ for at least $(1-\epsilon)$ fraction of the elements $b$ of $B_a$.
I.e., if $f(a)\not=0$ then $\Pr_{b\in B_a}[f(b)\not=0]\ge 1-\epsilon$. The {\it
size} of the $(1-\epsilon)$-tester is $\max_{a\in A}|B_a|$ and the goal is to
minimize this size, construct $B_a$ in deterministic almost linear time and
access and compute each map in poly-log time.
  We use tools from elementary algebra and algebraic function fields to build
$(1-\epsilon)$-testers of small size in deterministic almost linear time. We
also show that our constructions are locally explicit, i.e., one can find any
entry in the construction in time poly-log in the size of the construction and
the field size. We also prove lower bounds that show that the sizes of our
testers and the densities are almost optimal.
  Testers were used in [Bshouty, Testers and its application, ITCS 2014] to
construct almost optimal perfect hash families, universal sets, cover-free
families, separating hash functions, black box identity testing and hitting
sets. The dense testers in this paper shows that such constructions can be done
in almost linear time, are locally explicit and can be made to be dense."
"The generalized conductance $\phi(G,H)$ between two graphs $G$ and $H$ on the
same vertex set $V$ is defined as the ratio $$
  \phi(G,H) = \min_{S\subseteq V} \frac{cap_G(S,\bar{S})}{ cap_H(S,\bar{S})},
$$ where $cap_G(S,\bar{S})$ is the total weight of the edges crossing from $S$
to $\bar{S}=V-S$. We show that the minimum generalized eigenvalue
$\lambda(L_G,L_H)$ of the pair of Laplacians $L_G$ and $L_H$ satisfies $$
  \lambda(L_G,L_H) \geq \phi(G,H) \phi(G)/8, $$ where $\phi(G)$ is the usual
conductance of $G$. A generalized cut that meets this bound can be obtained
from the generalized eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda(L_G,L_H)$. The
inequality complements a recent proof that $\phi(G)$ cannot be replaced by
$\Theta(\phi(G,H))$ in the above inequality, unless the Unique Games Conjecture
is false."
"At the heart of the Conway-Kochen Free Will theorem and Kochen and Specker's
argument against non-contextual hidden variable theories is the existence of a
Kochen-Specker (KS) system: a set of points on the sphere that has no
0,1-coloring such that at most one of two orthogonal points are colored 1 and
of three pairwise orthogonal points exactly one is colored 1. In public
lectures, Conway encouraged the search for small KS systems. At the time of
writing, the smallest known KS system has 31 vectors. Arends, Ouaknine and
Wampler have shown that a KS system has at least 18 vectors, by reducing the
problem to the existence of graphs with a topological embeddability and
non-colorability property. The bottleneck in their search proved to be the
sheer number of graphs on more than 17 vertices and deciding embeddability.
  Continuing their effort, we prove a restriction on the class of graphs we
need to consider and develop a more practical decision procedure for
embeddability to improve the lower bound to 22."
"A spanning subgraph $F$ of a graph $G$ is called perfect if $F$ is a forest,
the degree $d_F(x)$ of each vertex $x$ in $F$ is odd, and each tree of $F$ is
an induced subgraph of $G$. We provide a short proof of the following theorem
of A.D. Scott (Graphs & Combin., 2001): a connected graph $G$ contains a
perfect forest if and only if $G$ has an even number of vertices."
"A common question from students on the usual diagonalization proof for the
uncountability of the set of real numbers is: when a representation of real
numbers, such as the decimal expansions of real numbers, allows us to use the
diagonalization argument to prove that the set of real numbers is uncountable,
why can't we similarly apply the diagonalization argument to rational numbers
in the same representation? why doesn't the argument similarly prove that the
set of rational numbers is uncountable too? We consider two answers to this
question. We first discuss an answer that is based on the familiar decimal
expansions. We then present an unconventional answer that is based on continued
fractions."
"A graph is $k$-degenerate if any induced subgraph has a vertex of degree at
most $k$. In this paper we prove new algorithms for cliques and similar
structures for these graphs. We design linear time Fixed-Parameter Tractable
algorithms for induced and non induced bicliques. We prove an algorithm listing
all maximal bicliques in time $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}(n-k)2^{k})$, improving the
result of [D. Eppstein, Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms,
Information Processing Letters, (1994)]. We construct an algorithm listing all
cliques of size $l$ in time $\mathcal{O}(l(n-k)k(k-1)^{l-2})$, improving a
result of [N. Chiba and T. Nishizeki, Arboricity and subgraph listing
algorithms, SIAM, (1985)]. As a consequence we can list all triangles in such
graphs in time $\mathcal{O}((n-k)k^{2})$ improving the previous bound of
$\mathcal{O}(nk^2)$. We show another optimal algorithm listing all maximal
cliques in time $\mathcal{O}(k(n-k)3^{k/3})$, matching the best possible
complexity proved in [D. Eppstein, M. L\""offler, and D. Strash, Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs, JEA, (2013)]. Finally we
prove $(2-\frac{1}{k})$ and $\mathcal{O}(k(\log\log k)^{2}\slash (\log
k)^{3})$-approximation algorithms for the minimum vertex cover and the maximum
clique problems, respectively."
"It is well known that if a function from set A to set B has a right inverse
then the function is a surjection and the right inverse is an injection. For
finite sets, the number of functions, injections, and surjections can also be
counted. Relations generalize functions: do similar results exist for
relations? This paper proves several new results concerning binary relations.
For finite sets, we derive formulas for the number of right total, right
unique, left total, and left unique relations. We also provide formulas that
count the number of relations that are both right unique and left unique; right
unique and right total; and left unique and left total. We conclude by
discussing the probability that a relation selected at random is right unique
or right total."
"Symbolic ultrametrics define edge-colored complete graphs K_n and yield a
simple tree representation of K_n. We discuss, under which conditions this idea
can be generalized to find a symbolic ultrametric that, in addition,
distinguishes between edges and non-edges of arbitrary graphs G=(V,E) and thus,
yielding a simple tree representation of G. We prove that such a symbolic
ultrametric can only be defined for G if and only if G is a so-called cograph.
A cograph is uniquely determined by a so-called cotree. As not all graphs are
cographs, we ask, furthermore, what is the minimum number of cotrees needed to
represent the topology of G. The latter problem is equivalent to find an
optimal cograph edge k-decomposition {E_1,...,E_k} of E so that each subgraph
(V,E_i) of G is a cograph. An upper bound for the integer k is derived and it
is shown that determining whether a graph has a cograph 2-decomposition, resp.,
2-partition is NP-complete."
"We study the dynamics of majority automata networks when the vertices are
updated according to a block sequential updating scheme. In particular, we show
that the complexity of the problem of predicting an eventual state change in
some vertex, given an initial configuration, is PSPACE-complete."
"In this paper we show how to solve the \emph{Maximum Weight Stable Set
Problem} in a claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ with $\alpha(G) \le 3$ in time ${\cal
O}(|E|\log|V|)$. More precisely, in time ${\cal O}(|E|)$ we check whether
$\alpha(G) \le 3$ or produce a stable set with cardinality at least $4$;
moreover, if $\alpha(G) \le 3$ we produce in time ${\cal O}(|E|\log|V|)$ a
maximum stable set of $G$. This improves the bound of ${\cal O}(|E||V|)$ due to
Faenza et al."
"A claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ is said to be basic if there exists a matching $M
\subseteq E$ whose edges are strongly bisimplicial and such that each connected
component $C$ of $G - M$ is either a clique or a {claw, net}-free graph or
satisfies $\alpha(G[C \setminus V(M)]) \le 3$. The Maximum Weight Stable Set
(MWSS) Problem in a basic claw-free graph can be easily solved by first solving
at most four MWSS problems in each connected component of $G - M$ in ${\cal
O}(|V|^2 \log(|V|))$ time (\cite{NobiliSassano15a,NobiliSassano15b}) and then
solving the MWSS Problem on a suitable line graph constructed from $G$ in
${\cal O}(|V|^2 \log(|V|))$ time. In this paper we show that, by means of
lifting operations, every claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ can be transformed, in
${\cal O}(|V|^2)$ time, into a basic claw-free graph $\bar G(\bar V, \bar E)$
such that $|\bar V| = {\cal O}(|V|)$ and a MWSS of $G$ can be obtained from a
MWSS of $\bar G$. This shows that the complexity of solving the MWSS Problem in
a claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ is ${\cal O}(|V|^2 \log(|V|))$, the same as in line
graphs."
"In this paper we show that a connected {claw, net}-free graph $G(V, E)$ with
$\alpha(G) \ge 4$ is the union of a strongly bisimplicial clique $Q$ and at
most two clique-strips. A clique is strongly bisimplicial if its neighborhood
is partitioned into two cliques which are mutually non-adjacent and a
clique-strip is a sequence of cliques $\{H_0, \dots, H_p\}$ with the property
that $H_i$ is adjacent only to $H_{i-1}$ and $H_{i+1}$. By exploiting such a
structure we show how to solve the Maximum Weight Stable Set Problem in such a
graph in time ${\cal O}(|V|\sqrt{|E|})$."
"Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a \emph{perfect dominating set} is a subset of
vertices $V' \subseteq V(G)$ such that each vertex $v \in V(G)\setminus V'$ is
dominated by exactly one vertex $v' \in V'$. An \emph{efficient dominating set}
is a perfect dominating set $V'$ where $V'$ is also an independent set. These
problems are usually posed in terms of edges instead of vertices. Both
problems, either for the vertex or edge variant, remains NP-Hard, even when
restricted to certain graphs families. We study both variants of the problems
for the circular-arc graphs, and show efficient algorithms for all of them."
"Let ${\cal F}$ be a set of blocks of a $t$-set $X$. $(X,{\cal F})$ is called
$(w,r)$-cover-free family ($(w,r)-$CFF) provided that, the intersection of any
$w$ blocks in ${\cal F}$ is not contained in the union of any other $r$ blocks
in ${\cal F}$. We give new asymptotic lower bounds for the number of minimum
points $t$ in a $(w,r)$-CFF when $w\le r=|{\cal F}|^\epsilon$ for some constant
$\epsilon\ge 1/2$."
"In the paper we consider the problem of scheduling $n$ identical jobs on 3
uniform machines with speeds $s_1, s_2,$ and $s_3$ to minimize the schedule
length. We assume that jobs are subjected to some kind of mutual exclusion
constraints, modeled by a cubic incompatibility graph. We show that if the
graph is 2-chromatic then the problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time. If the
graph is 3-chromatic, the problem becomes NP-hard even if $s_1>s_2=s_3$.
However, in this case there exists a $4/3$-approximation algorithm running in
$O(n^3)$ time. Moreover, this algorithm solves the problem almost surely to
optimality if $3s_1/4 \leq s_2 = s_3$."
"In this work we consider \emph{temporal networks}, i.e. networks defined by a
\emph{labeling} $\lambda$ assigning to each edge of an \emph{underlying graph}
$G$ a set of \emph{discrete} time-labels. The labels of an edge, which are
natural numbers, indicate the discrete time moments at which the edge is
available. We focus on \emph{path problems} of temporal networks. In
particular, we consider \emph{time-respecting} paths, i.e. paths whose edges
are assigned by $\lambda$ a strictly increasing sequence of labels. We begin by
giving two efficient algorithms for computing shortest time-respecting paths on
a temporal network. We then prove that there is a \emph{natural analogue of
Menger's theorem} holding for arbitrary temporal networks. Finally, we propose
two \emph{cost minimization parameters} for temporal network design. One is the
\emph{temporality} of $G$, in which the goal is to minimize the maximum number
of labels of an edge, and the other is the \emph{temporal cost} of $G$, in
which the goal is to minimize the total number of labels used. Optimization of
these parameters is performed subject to some \emph{connectivity constraint}.
We prove several lower and upper bounds for the temporality and the temporal
cost of some very basic graph families such as rings, directed acyclic graphs,
and trees."
"We study the design of small cost temporally connected graphs, under various
constraints. We mainly consider undirected graphs of $n$ vertices, where each
edge has an associated set of discrete availability instances (labels). A
journey from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is a path from $u$ to $v$ where
successive path edges have strictly increasing labels. A graph is temporally
connected iff there is a $(u,v)$-journey for any pair of vertices $u,v,~u\not=
v$. We first give a simple polynomial-time algorithm to check whether a given
temporal graph is temporally connected. We then consider the case in which a
designer of temporal graphs can \emph{freely choose} availability instances for
all edges and aims for temporal connectivity with very small \emph{cost}; the
cost is the total number of availability instances used. We achieve this via a
simple polynomial-time procedure which derives designs of cost linear in $n$.
We also show that the above procedure is (almost) optimal when the underlying
graph is a tree, by proving a lower bound on the cost for any tree. However,
there are pragmatic cases where one is not free to design a temporally
connected graph anew, but is instead \emph{given} a temporal graph design with
the claim that it is temporally connected, and wishes to make it more
cost-efficient by removing labels without destroying temporal connectivity
(redundant labels). Our main technical result is that computing the maximum
number of redundant labels is APX-hard, i.e., there is no PTAS unless $P=NP$.
On the positive side, we show that in dense graphs with random edge
availabilities, there is asymptotically almost surely a very large number of
redundant labels. A temporal design may, however, be \emph{minimal}, i.e., no
redundant labels exist. We show the existence of minimal temporal designs with
at least $n \log{n}$ labels."
"Given a finite set $N$ of feasible points of a multi-objective optimization
(MOO) problem, the search region corresponds to the part of the objective space
containing all the points that are not dominated by any point of $N$, i.e. the
part of the objective space which may contain further nondominated points. In
this paper, we consider a representation of the search region by a set of tight
local upper bounds (in the minimization case) that can be derived from the
points of $N$. Local upper bounds play an important role in methods for
generating or approximating the nondominated set of an MOO problem, yet few
works in the field of MOO address their efficient incremental determination. We
relate this issue to the state of the art in computational geometry and provide
several equivalent definitions of local upper bounds that are meaningful in
MOO. We discuss the complexity of this representation in arbitrary dimension,
which yields an improved upper bound on the number of solver calls in
epsilon-constraint-like methods to generate the nondominated set of a discrete
MOO problem. We analyze and enhance a first incremental approach which operates
by eliminating redundancies among local upper bounds. We also study some
properties of local upper bounds, especially concerning the issue of redundant
local upper bounds, that give rise to a new incremental approach which avoids
such redundancies. Finally, the complexities of the incremental approaches are
compared from the theoretical and empirical points of view."
"This study presents an abelian group approach to analyzing inconsistency in
pairwise comparisons. A notion of an inconsistency indicator map on a group,
taking values in an abelian linearly ordered group, is introduced. For it,
metrics and generalized metrics are utilized. Every inconsistency indicator map
generates both a metric on a group and an inconsistency indicator of an
arbitrary pairwise comparisons matrix over the group."
"Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $G$ be a graph. A function $f: V(G)
\rightarrow 2^{[k]}$ is a rainbow function if, for every vertex $x$ with
$f(x)=\emptyset$, $f(N(x)) =[k]$. The rainbow domination number
$\gamma_{kr}(G)$ is the minimum of $\sum_{x \in V(G)} |f(x)|$ over all rainbow
functions. We investigate the rainbow domination problem for some classes of
perfect graphs."
"For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $D\subseteq V$ is called a \emph{disjunctive
dominating set} of $G$ if for every vertex $v\in V\setminus D$, $v$ is either
adjacent to a vertex of $D$ or has at least two vertices in $D$ at distance $2$
from it. The cardinality of a minimum disjunctive dominating set of $G$ is
called the \emph{disjunctive domination number} of graph $G$, and is denoted by
$\gamma_{2}^{d}(G)$. The \textsc{Minimum Disjunctive Domination Problem} (MDDP)
is to find a disjunctive dominating set of cardinality $\gamma_{2}^{d}(G)$.
Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G$, the \textsc{Disjunctive
Domination Decision Problem} (DDDP) is to decide whether $G$ has a disjunctive
dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. In this article, we first propose a
linear time algorithm for MDDP in proper interval graphs. Next we tighten the
NP-completeness of DDDP by showing that it remains NP-complete even in chordal
graphs. We also propose a $(\ln(\Delta^{2}+\Delta+2)+1)$-approximation
algorithm for MDDP in general graphs and prove that MDDP can not be
approximated within $(1-\epsilon) \ln(|V|)$ for any $\epsilon>0$ unless NP
$\subseteq$ DTIME$(|V|^{O(\log \log |V|)})$. Finally, we show that MDDP is
APX-complete for bipartite graphs with maximum degree $3$."
"In the study of random structures we often face a trade-off between realism
and tractability, the latter typically enabled by assuming some form of
independence. In this work we initiate an effort to bridge this gap by
developing tools that allow us to work with independence without assuming it.
Let $\mathcal{G}_{n}$ be the set of all graphs on $n$ vertices and let $S$ be
an arbitrary subset of $\mathcal{G}_{n}$, e.g., the set of graphs with $m$
edges. The study of random networks can be seen as the study of properties that
are true for most elements of $S$, i.e., that are true with high probability
for a uniformly random element of $S$. With this in mind, we pursue the
following question: What are general sufficient conditions for the uniform
measure on a set of graphs $S \subseteq \mathcal{G}_{n}$ to be approximable by
a product measure?"
"In this paper, we study the contribution of the theory of grossone to the
study of infinigons in the hyperbolic plane. We can see that the theory of
grossone can help us to obtain much more classification for these objects than
in the traditional setting."
"Let $G$ be a finite undirected graph. A vertex {\em dominates} itself and all
its neighbors in $G$. A vertex set $D$ is an {\em efficient dominating set}
(\emph{e.d.}\ for short) of $G$ if every vertex of $G$ is dominated by exactly
one vertex of $D$. The \emph{Efficient Domination} (ED) problem, which asks for
the existence of an e.d.\ in $G$, is known to be \NP-complete even for very
restricted graph classes such as $P_7$-free chordal graphs. The ED problem on a
graph $G$ can be reduced to the Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem
on the square of $G$. The complexity of the ED problem is an open question for
$P_6$-free graphs and was open even for the subclass of $P_6$-free chordal
graphs. In this paper, we show that squares of $P_6$-free chordal graphs that
have an e.d. are chordal; this even holds for the larger class of ($P_6$,
house, hole, domino)-free graphs. This implies that ED/WeightedED is solvable
in polynomial time for ($P_6$, house, hole, domino)-free graphs; in particular,
for $P_6$-free chordal graphs. Moreover, based on our result that squares of
$P_6$-free graphs that have an e.d. are hole-free and some properties
concerning odd antiholes, we show that squares of ($P_6$, house)-free graphs
(($P_6$, bull)-free graphs, respectively) that have an e.d. are perfect. This
implies that ED/WeightedED is solvable in polynomial time for ($P_6$,
house)-free graphs and for ($P_6$, bull)-free graphs (the time bound for
($P_6$, house, hole, domino)-free graphs is better than that for ($P_6$,
house)-free graphs). The complexity of the ED problem for $P_6$-free graphs
remains an open question."
"A path $P = v_1, ..., v_t$ is a {\em triangle path} (respectively, {\em
monophonic path}) of $G$ if no edges exist joining vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ of
$P$ such that $|j - i| > 2$; (respectively, $|j - i| > 1$). A set of vertices
$S$ is {\em convex} in the triangle path convexity (respectively, monophonic
convexity) of $G$ if the vertices of every triangle path (respectively,
monophonic path) joining two vertices of $S$ are in $S$. The cardinality of a
maximum proper convex set of $G$ is the {\em convexity number of $G$} and the
cardinality of a minimum set of vertices whose convex hull is $V(G)$ is the
{\em hull number of $G$}. Our main results are polynomial time algorithms for
determining the convexity number and the hull number of a graph in the triangle
path convexity."
"Given a vertex-coloured graph, a dominating set is said to be tropical if
every colour of the graph appears at least once in the set. Here, we study
minimum tropical dominating sets from structural and algorithmic points of
view. First, we prove that the tropical dominating set problem is NP-complete
even when restricted to a simple path. Then, we establish upper bounds related
to various parameters of the graph such as minimum degree and number of edges.
We also give upper bounds for random graphs. Last, we give approximability and
inapproximability results for general and restricted classes of graphs, and
establish a FPT algorithm for interval graphs."
"In this paper we propose an efficient solution for the problem of generating
k-labeling forest VNS. This problem is an extension of the Minimum Spanning
Tree Problem Labelling problem with important applications in
telecommunications networks and multimodal transport. It is, given an
undirected graph whose links are labeled, and an integer positive number k,
find the spanning forest with the lowest number of connected components using
at most k different labels. To address the problem a Basic Variable
Neighbourhood Search is proposed where the maximum amplitude of the
neighbourhood space, n, is a key parameter. Different strategies are studied to
establish the value of n. BVNS with the best selected strategy is
experimentally compared with other metaheuristics that have appeared in the
literature applied to this type of problem."
"We show that determining the chromatic number of a $\{P_5,\bar{P_5}\}$-free
graph or a $\{P_5,K_p-e\}$-free graph can be done in polynomial time"
"The uncertainty principle states that a signal cannot be localized both in
time and frequency. With the aim of extending this result to signals on graphs,
Agaskar&Lu introduce notions of graph and spectral spreads. They show that a
graph uncertainty principle holds for some families of unweighted graphs. This
principle states that a signal cannot be simultaneously localized both in graph
and spectral domains. In this paper, we aim to extend their work to weighted
graphs. We show that a naive extension of their definitions leads to
inconsistent results such as discontinuity of the graph spread when regarded as
a function of the graph structure. To circumvent this problem, we propose
another definition of graph spread that relies on an inverse similarity matrix.
We also discuss the choice of the distance function that appears in this
definition. Finally, we compute and plot uncertainty curves for families of
weighted graphs."
"Matrices are the most common representations of graphs. They are also used
for the representation of algebras and cluster algebras. This paper shows some
properties of matrices in order to facilitate the understanding and locating
symmetrizable matrices with specific characteristics, called positive
quasi-Cartan companion matrices. Here, symmetrizable matrix are those which are
symmetric when multiplied by a diagonal matrix with positive entries called
symmetrizer matrix. Four algorithms are developed: one to decide whether there
is a symmetrizer matrix; second to find such symmetrizer matrix; another to
decide whether the matrix is positive or not; and the last to find a positive
quasi-Cartan companion matrix, if there exists. The third algorithm is used to
prove that the problem to decide if a matrix has a positive quasi-Cartan
companion is NP."
"A Fast algorithm for the Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT) is presented, which
resembles radix-2 fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Although fast DHTs are already
known, this new approach bring some light about the deep relationship between
fast DHT algorithms and a multiplication-free fast algorithm for the Hadamard
Transform."
"A graph that contains a spanning tree of diameter at most $t$ clearly admits
a tree $t$-spanner, since a tree $t$-spanner of a graph $G$ is a sub tree of
$G$ such that the distance between pairs of vertices in the tree is at most $t$
times their distance in $G$. In this paper, graphs that admit a tree
$t$-spanner of diameter at most $t+1$ are studied. For $t$ equal to 1 or 2 the
problem has been solved. For $t=3$ we present an algorithm that determines if a
graph admits a tree 3-spanner of diameter at most 4. For $t\geq4$ it is proved
that it is an NP-complete problem to decide whether a graph admits a tree
$t$-spanner of diameter at most $t+1$."
"How low can the joint entropy of $n$ $d$-wise independent (for $d\ge2$)
discrete random variables be, subject to given constraints on the individual
distributions (say, no value may be taken by a variable with probability
greater than $p$, for $p<1$)? This question has been posed and partially
answered in a recent work of Babai.
  In this paper we improve some of his bounds, prove new bounds in a wider
range of parameters and show matching upper bounds in some special cases. In
particular, we prove tight lower bounds for the min-entropy (as well as the
entropy) of pairwise and three-wise independent balanced binary variables for
infinitely many values of $n$."
"We give the exact upper and lower bounds of the M{\""o}bius inverse of
monotone and normalized set functions (a.k.a. normalized capacities) on a
finite set of n elements. We find that the absolute value of the bounds tend to
4 n/2 $\sqrt$ $\pi$n/2 when n is large. We establish also the exact bounds of
the interaction transform and Banzhaf interaction transform, as well as the
exact bounds of the M{\""o}bius inverse for the subfamilies of k-additive
normalized capacities and p-symmetric normalized capacities."
"We consider a new probabilistic graph searching game played on graphs,
inspired by the familiar game of Cops and Robbers. In Zombies and Survivors, a
set of zombies attempts to eat a lone survivor loose on a given graph. The
zombies randomly choose their initial location, and during the course of the
game, move directly toward the survivor. At each round, they move to the
neighbouring vertex that minimizes the distance to the survivor; if there is
more than one such vertex, then they choose one uniformly at random. The
survivor attempts to escape from the zombies by moving to a neighbouring vertex
or staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if eventually one of them
eats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise, the survivor wins. The
zombie number of a graph is the minimum number of zombies needed to play such
that the probability that they win is strictly greater than 1/2. We present
asymptotic results for the zombie numbers of several graph families, such as
cycles, hypercubes, incidence graphs of projective planes, and Cartesian and
toroidal grids."
"We present a PTAS for computing the maximum a posteriori assignment on
Pairwise Markov Random Fields with non-negative weights in planar graphs. This
algorithm is practical and not far behind state-of-the-art techniques in image
processing. MAP on Pairwise Markov Random Fields with (possibly) negative
weights cannot be approximated unless P = NP, even on planar graphs. We also
show via reduction that this yields a PTAS for one scoring function of
Correlation Clustering in planar graphs."
"A line-broadcasting model in a connected graph $G=(V,E)$, $|V|=n$, is a model
in which one vertex, called the {\it originator} of the broadcast holds a
message that has to be transmitted to all vertices of the graph through
placement of a series of calls over the graph. In this model, an informed
vertex can transmit a message through a path of any length in a single time
unit, as long as two transmissions do not use the same edge at the same time.
Farley \cite{f} has shown that the process is completed within at most $\lceil
\log_{2}n \rceil$ time units from any originator in a tree (and thus in any
connected undirected graph). and that the cost of broadcasting one message from
any vertex is at most $(n-1) \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil$.
  In this paper, we present lower and upper bounds for the cost to broadcast
one message in a complete $k-$tree, from any vertex using the line-broadcasting
model. We prove that if $B(u)$ is the minimum cost to broadcast in a graph
$G=(V,E)$ from a vertex $u \in V$ using the line-broadcasting model, then
$(1+o(1))n \le B(u) \le (2+o(1))n$, where $u$ is any vertex in a complete
$k$-tree. Furthermore, for certain conditions, $B(u) \le (2-o(1))n$."
"We study tilings of the plane that combine strong properties of different
nature: combinatorial and algorithmic. We prove existence of a tile set that
accepts only quasiperiodic and non-recursive tilings. Our construction is based
on the fixed point construction; we improve this general technique and make it
enforce the property of local regularity of tilings needed for
quasiperiodicity. We prove also a stronger result: any effectively closed set
can be recursively transformed into a tile set so that the Turing degrees of
the resulted tilings consists exactly of the upper cone based on the Turing
degrees of the later."
"A graph G=(V,E) is a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists an
edge-weighted tree T and two non-negative real numbers `d' and `D' such that
each leaf `u' of T is a node of V and the edge `(u,v) belongs to E' iff `d <=
d_T(u, v) <= D' where d_T(u, v) is the sum of weights of the edges on the
unique path from `u' to `v' in T. The main issue on these graphs consists in
characterizing them.
  In this note we prove the inclusion in the PCG class of threshold tolerance
graphs and the non-inclusion of a number of intersection graphs, such as disk
and grid intersection graphs, circular arc and tolerance graphs. The
non-inclusion of some superclasses (trapezoid, permutation and rectangle
intersection graphs) follows."
"Suppose you are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with a weight assignment
$w:V\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ and that your objective is to modify $w$ using legal
steps such that all vertices will have the same weight, where in each legal
step you are allowed to choose an edge and increment the weights of its end
points by $1$.
  In this paper we study several variants of this problem for graphs and
hypergraphs. On the combinatorial side we show connections with fundamental
results from matching theory such as Hall's Theorem and Tutte's Theorem. On the
algorithmic side we study the computational complexity of associated decision
problems.
  Our main results are a characterization of the graphs for which any initial
assignment can be balanced by edge-increments and a strongly polynomial-time
algorithm that computes a balancing sequence of increments if one exists."
"We present the algebraic representation and basic algorithms for MultiAspect
Graphs (MAGs). A MAG is a structure capable of representing multilayer and
time-varying networks, as well as higher-order networks, while also having the
property of being isomorphic to a directed graph. In particular, we show that,
as a consequence of the properties associated with the MAG structure, a MAG can
be represented in matrix form. Moreover, we also show that any possible MAG
function (algorithm) can be obtained from this matrix-based representation.
This is an important theoretical result since it paves the way for adapting
well-known graph algorithms for application in MAGs. We present a set of basic
MAG algorithms, constructed from well-known graph algorithms, such as degree
computing, Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Search (DFS). These
algorithms adapted to the MAG context can be used as primitives for building
other more sophisticated MAG algorithms. Therefore, such examples can be seen
as guidelines on how to properly derive MAG algorithms from basic algorithms on
directed graph. We also make available Python implementations of all the
algorithms presented in this paper."
"We introduce the notion of specular sets which are subsets of groups called
here specular and which form a natural generalization of free groups. These
sets are an abstract generalization of the natural codings of linear
involutions. We prove several results concerning the subgroups generated by
return words and by maximal bifix codes in these sets."
"Sensitivity is an important complexity measure of Boolean functions. In this
paper we present properties of the minimal and maximal sensitivity of the
simplified weighted sum function. A simple close formula of the minimal
sensitivity of the simplified weighted sum function is obtained. A phenomenon
is exhibited that the minimal sensitivity of the weighted sum function is
indeed an indicator of large primes, that is, for large prime number p, the
minimal sensitivity of the weighted sum function is always equal to one."
"This study investigates a powerful model, targeted to subjective assessments,
based on pairwise comparisons. It provides a proof that a distance-based
inconsistency reduction transforms an inconsistent pairwise comparisons (PC)
matrix into a consistent PC matrix which is generated by the geometric means of
rows of a given inconsistent PC matrix. The distance-based inconsistency
indicator was defined in 1993 for pairwise comparisons. Its convergence was
analyzed in 1996 (regretfully, with an incomplete proof; finally completed in
2010). However, there was no clear interpretation of the convergence limit
which is of considerable importance for applications and this study does so."
"We show that every trace monoid is isomorphic to a sub-monoid of a monoid of
word vectors. It provides a concrete representation of the elements of a trace
monoid as processes associated with a resource sharing mechanism. We illustrate
this representation by obtaining some results on the ordering structure of the
left divisibility relation on trace monoids."
"Boxicity of a graph G(V, E) is the minimum integer k such that G can be
represented as the intersection graph of axis parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^k$.
Cubicity is a variant of boxicity, where the axis parallel boxes in the
intersection representation are restricted to be of unit length sides. Deciding
whether boxicity (resp. cubicity) of a graph is at most k is NP-hard, even for
k=2 or 3. Computing these parameters is inapproximable within $O(n^{1 -
\epsilon})$-factor, for any $\epsilon >0$ in polynomial time unless NP=ZPP,
even for many simple graph classes.
  In this paper, we give a polynomial time $\kappa(n)$ factor approximation
algorithm for computing boxicity and a $\kappa(n)\lceil \log \log n\rceil$
factor approximation algorithm for computing the cubicity, where $\kappa(n)
=2\left\lceil\frac{n\sqrt{\log \log n}}{\sqrt{\log n}}\right\rceil$. These o(n)
factor approximation algorithms also produce the corresponding box (resp. cube)
representations. As a special case, this resolves the question paused by
Spinrad about polynomial time construction of o(n) dimensional box
representations for boxicity 2 graphs. Other consequences of our approximation
algorithm include $O(\kappa(n))$ factor approximation algorithms for computing
the following parameters: the partial order dimension of finite posets, the
interval dimension of finite posets, minimum chain cover of bipartite graphs,
threshold dimension of split graphs and Ferrer's dimension of digraphs. Each of
these parameters is inapproximable within an $O(n^{1 - \epsilon})$-factor, for
any $\epsilon >0$ in polynomial time unless NP=ZPP and the algorithms we derive
seem to be the first o(n) factor approximation algorithms known for all these
problems."
"Processing information, acquired by subjective assessments, involves
inconsistency analysis in most (if not all) applications of which some are of
considerable importance at a national level (see, Koczkodaj/Kulakowski/Ligenza,
Scientometrics, 99(3): 911-926, 2014)A triad inconsistency axiomatization in
pairwise comparisons was informally proposed in Koczkodaj/Szwarc, FUNDAMENTA
INFORMATICAE, 132(4): 485-500, 2014. This study, rectifies it by the use of the
distance and theoretical proofs. Three key properties of the indicator are
presented in this study and illustrated by several examples."
"The problem of maximizing non-negative submodular functions has been studied
extensively in the last few years. However, most papers consider submodular set
functions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case
of submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a
deterministic $\frac{1}{3}$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function
on a bounded integer lattice $\{0, \ldots, C\}^n$ using a Double Greedy
framework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas
used for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to
set functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the
so-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown
that many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer
lattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the
integer lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and
assume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that
some approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular,
we can obtain a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a
$(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality
constraint and a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for a poset matroid constraint. On
the other hand, for a knapsack constraint, the problem becomes significantly
harder: even for monotone DR-submodular functions, we show that there is no
$2^{(\log (n^{1/2} - 1))^\delta - 1}$-approximation for every $\delta > 0$
under the assumption that $3-SAT$ cannot be solved in time $2^{n^{3/4 +
\epsilon}}$."
"Gy{\'a}rf{\'a}s et al. and Zaker have proven that the Grundy number of a
graph $G$ satisfies $\Gamma(G)\ge t$ if and only if $G$ contains an induced
subgraph called a $t$-atom.The family of $t$-atoms has bounded order and
contains a finite number of graphs.In this article, we introduce equivalents of
$t$-atoms for b-coloring and partial Grundy coloring.This concept is used to
prove that determining if $\varphi(G)\ge t$ and $\partial\Gamma(G)\ge t$ (under
conditions for the b-coloring), for a graph $G$, is in XP with parameter $t$.We
illustrate the utility of the concept of $t$-atoms by giving results on
b-critical vertices and edges, on b-perfect graphs and on graphs of girth at
least $7$."
"We completely determine the complexity status of the dominating set problem
for hereditary graph classes defined by forbidden induced subgraphs with at
most five vertices."
"When we try to solve a system of linear equations, we can consider a simple
iterative algorithm in which an equation including only one variable is chosen
at each step, and the variable is fixed to the value satisfying the equation.
The dynamics of this algorithm is captured by the peeling algorithm. Analyses
of the peeling algorithm on random hypergraphs are required for many problems,
e.g., the decoding threshold of low-density parity check codes, the inverting
threshold of Goldreich's pseudorandom generator, the load threshold of cuckoo
hashing, etc. In this work, we deal with random hypergraphs including
superlinear number of hyperedges, and derive the tight threshold for the
succeeding of the peeling algorithm. For the analysis, Wormald's method of
differential equations, which is commonly used for analyses of the peeling
algorithm on random hypergraph with linear number of hyperedges, cannot be used
due to the superlinear number of hyperedges. A new method called the evolution
of the moment generating function is proposed in this work."
"We give a new bound on the sum of the linear Fourier coefficients of a
Boolean function in terms of its parity decision tree complexity. This result
generalizes an inequality of O'Donnell and Servedio for regular decision trees.
We use this bound to obtain the first non-trivial lower bound on the parity
decision tree complexity of the recursive majority function."
"CVT and XOR are two binary operations together used to calculate the sum of
two non-negative integers on using a recursive mechanism. In this present study
the convergence behaviors of this recursive mechanism has been captured through
a tree like structure named as CVT-XOR Tree. We have analyzed how to identify
the parent nodes, leaf nodes and internal nodes in the CVT-XOR Tree. We also
provide the parent information, depth information and the number of children of
a node in different CVT-XOR Trees on defining three different matrices. Lastly,
one observation is made towards very old Mathematical problem of Goldbach
Conjecture."
"This paper proposes a new cubical space model for the representation of
continuous objects and surfaces in the n-dimensional Euclidean space by
discrete sets of points. The cubical space model concerns the process of
converting a continuous object in its digital counterpart, which is a graph,
enabling us to apply notions and operations used in digital imaging to cubical
spaces. We formulate a definition of a simple n-cube and prove that deleting or
attaching a simple n-cube does not change the homotopy type of a cubical space.
Relying on these results, we design a procedure, which preserves basic
topological properties of an n-dimensional object, for constructing compressed
cubical and digital models."
"In this paper we study the concurrent cops and robber (CCCR) game. CCCR
follows the same rules as the classical, turn-based game, except for the fact
that the players move simultaneously. The cops' goal is to capture the robber
and the concurrent cop number of a graph is defined the minimum number of cops
which guarantees capture. For the variant in which it it required to capture
the robber in the shortest possible time, we let time to capture be the payoff
function of CCCR; the (game theoretic) value of CCCR is the optimal capture
time and (cop and robber) time optimal strategies are the ones which achieve
the value. In this paper we prove the following.
  (1) For every graph G, the concurrent cop number is equal to the ""classical""
cop number.
  (2) For every graph G, CCCR has a value, the cops have an optimal strategy
and, for every epsilon>0, the robber has an epsilon-optimal strategy."
"Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a well-founded method for data analysis and
has many applications in data mining. Pattern structures is an extension of FCA
for dealing with complex data such as sequences or graphs. However the
computational complexity of computing with pattern structures is high and
projections of pattern structures were introduced for simplifying computation.
In this paper we introduce o-projections of pattern structures, a
generalization of projections which defines a wider class of projections
preserving the properties of the original approach. Moreover, we show that
o-projections form a semilattice and we discuss the correspondence between
o-projections and the representation contexts of o-projected pattern
structures.

"We consider a variant of Dickson lemma, where each entry of a vector can be
reseted or incremented by 1 in respect to the previous one. We give an example
of non dominating sequence of length $2^{2^{\theta (n)}}$. It perfectly match
the previously known upperbound."
"The packing chromatic number $\pcn(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer
$k$ such that its set of vertices $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $k$ disjoint
subsets $V\_1$, \ldots, $V\_k$, in such a way that every two distinct vertices
in $V\_i$ are at distance greater than $i$ in $G$ for every $i$, $1\le i\le k$.
For a given integer $p \ge 1$, the generalized corona $G\odot pK\_1$ of a graph
$G$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by adding $p$ degree-one neighbors to every
vertex of $G$. In this paper, we determine the packing chromatic number of
generalized coronae of paths and cycles. Moreover, by considering digraphs and
the (weak) directed distance between vertices, we get a natural extension of
the notion of packing coloring to digraphs. We then determine the packing
chromatic number of orientations of generalized coronae of paths and cycles."
"We investigate a new oriented variant of the Firefighter Problem. In the
traditional Firefighter Problem, a fire breaks out at a given vertex of a
graph, and at each time interval spreads to neighbouring vertices that have not
been protected, while a constant number of vertices are protected at each time
interval. In the version of the problem considered here, the firefighters are
able to orient the edges of the graph before the fire breaks out, but the fire
could start at any vertex. We consider this problem when played on a graph in
one of several graph classes, and give upper and lower bounds on the number of
vertices that can be saved. In particular, when one firefighter is available at
each time interval, and the given graph is a complete graph, or a complete
bipartite graph, we present firefighting strategies that are provably optimal.
We also provide lower bounds on the number of vertices that can be saved as a
function of the chromatic number, of the maximum degree, and of the treewidth
of a graph. For a subcubic graph, we show that the firefighters can save all
but two vertices, and this is best possible."
"This work introduces a multidimensional generalization of the maximum
bisection problem. A mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed
with the proof of its correctness. The numerical tests, made on the randomly
generated graphs, indicates that the multidimensional generalization is more
difficult to solve than the original problem."
"An unexpected difference between online and offline algorithms is observed.
The natural greedy algorithms are shown to be worst case online optimal for
Online Independent Set and Online Vertex Cover on graphs with 'enough' isolated
vertices, Freckle Graphs. For Online Dominating Set, the greedy algorithm is
shown to be worst case online optimal on graphs with at least one isolated
vertex. These algorithms are not online optimal in general. The online
optimality results for these greedy algorithms imply optimality according to
various worst case performance measures, such as the competitive ratio. It is
also shown that, despite this worst case optimality, there are Freckle graphs
where the greedy independent set algorithm is objectively less good than
another algorithm. It is shown that it is NP-hard to determine any of the
following for a given graph: the online independence number, the online vertex
cover number, and the online domination number."
"It is well known by analysts that a concept lattice has an exponential size
in the data. Thus, as soon as he works with real data, the size of the concept
lattice is a fundamental problem. In this chapter, we propose to investigate
factor lattices as a tool to get meaningful parts of the whole lattice. These
factor lattices have been widely studied from the early theory of lattices to
more recent work in the FCA field. This chapter is divided into three parts. In
the first part, we present pieces of lattice theory and formal concept
analysis, namely compatible sub-contexts, arrow-closed sub-contexts and
congruence relations, all three notions used for the sub-direct decomposition
and the doubling convex construction used for the second decomposition, also
based on congruence relations. In the second part, the subdirect decomposition
into subdirectly irreducible factor is given, polynomial algorithms to compute
such a decomposition are given and an example is detailled to illustrate the
theory. Then in the third section, a new decomposition named ""revese doubling
construction"" is given. An example is given to explain this decomposition.
Theoretical results are given and proofs for the new ones also."
"We compute the exact number, L(n), of solutions to the Langford pairings
problem for any positive integer n<29 and the exact number of solutions to the
Nickerson variant of the problem, N(n), for any positive integer n<26. These
numbers correspond to the sequences A014552, A059106 in Sloane's Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The exact value of these numbers were known
for any positive integer n<27 for the A014552 sequence and for any positive
integer n<24 for the A059106 sequence. First we report that the number of
Langford pairings for n=27 is L(27)=111,683,611,098,764,903,232, and for n=28
it is L(28)=1,607,383,260,609,382,393,152. Next we report that the number of
solutions for the Nickerson variant of Langford pairings for n=24 is
N(24)=102,388,058,845,620,672 and for n=25 it is
N(25)=1,317,281,759,888,482,688."
"We study computational complexity of the class of distance-constrained graph
labeling problems from the fixed parameter tractability point of view. The
parameters studied are neighborhood diversity and clique width.
  We rephrase the distance constrained graph labeling problem as a specific
uniform variant of the Channel Assignment problem and show that this problem is
fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity
together with the largest weight. Consequently, every $L(p_1, p_2, \dots,
p_k)$-labeling problem is FPT when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity,
the maximum $p_i$ and $k.$
  Our results yield also FPT algorithms for all $L(p_1, p_2, \dots,
p_k)$-labeling problems when parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex
cover, answering an open question of Fiala et al.: Parameterized complexity of
coloring problems: Treewidth versus vertex cover. The same consequence applies
on Channel Assignment when the maximum weight is additionally included among
the parameters.
  Finally, we show that the uniform variant of the Channel Assignment problem
becomes NP-complete when generalized to graphs of bounded clique width."
"Consider the distance between two i.i.d. Poisson processes with arrival rate
$\lambda>0$ and respective arrival times $X_1,X_2,\dots$ and $Y_1,Y_2,\dots$ on
a line. We give a closed analytical formula for the %expected distance to the
power $a$ $\E{|X_{k+r}-Y_k|^a}, $ for any integer $k\ge 1, r\ge 0,$ when $a$ is
natural number. The expected distance to the power $a$ between two i.i.d.
Poisson processes we represent as the combination of the Pochhammer
polynomials. Especially, for $r=0,$ the following identity is valid $$
\E{|X_k-Y_k|^a}=\frac{a!}{\lambda^a}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{a}{2}+k\right)}{\Gamma(k)\Gamma\left(\frac{a}{2}+1\right)},
$$ where $\Gamma(z)$ is Gamma function. %Hence, we generalize the results of
\cite{dam_2014} to any power $a,$ when $a$ is natural number.
  As an application to sensor networks, we derive that the expected
transportation cost to the power $b$ of the bicolored matching with edges
$\{X_k,Y_k\}$ between two i.i.d. Poisson processes with arrival rate
$\lambda=n$ and respective arrival times $X_1,X_2,\dots$ and $Y_1,Y_2,\dots$ is
in $\Theta\left(n^{1-\frac{b}{2}}\right),$ when $b\ge 1,$ and in
$O\left(n^{1-\frac{b}{2}}\right),$ when $0 <b< 1.$"
"Let $G(V,E)$ be a $k$-uniform hypergraph. A hyperedge $e \in E$ is said to be
properly $(r,p)$ colored by an $r$-coloring of vertices in $V$ if $e$ contains
vertices of at least $p$ distinct colors in the $r$-coloring. An $r$-coloring
of vertices in $V$ is called a {\it strong $(r,p)$ coloring} if every hyperedge
$e \in E$ is properly $(r,p)$ colored by the $r$-coloring. We study the maximum
number of hyperedges that can be properly $(r,p)$ colored by a single
$r$-coloring and the structures that maximizes number of properly $(r,p)$
colored hyperedges."
"We introduce a variation of the scheduling with precedence constraints
problem that has applications to molecular folding and production management.
We are given a bipartite graph $H=(B,S)$. Vertices in $B$ are thought of as
goods or services that must be \emph{bought} to produce items in $S$ that are
to be \emph{sold}. An edge from $j\in S$ to $i\in B$ indicates that the
production of $j$ requires the purchase of $i$. Each vertex in $B$ has a cost,
and each vertex in $S$ results in some gain. The goal is to obtain an ordering
of $B\cup S$ that respects the precedence constraints and maximizes the minimal
net profit encountered as the vertices are processed. We call this optimal
value the \emph{budget} or \emph{capital} investment required for the bipartite
graph, and refer to our problem as \emph{the bipartite graph ordering problem}.
  The problem is equivalent to a version of an NP-complete molecular folding
problem that has been studied recently [12]. Work on the molecular folding
problem has focused on heuristic algorithms and exponential-time exact
algorithms for the un-weighted problem where costs are $\pm 1$ and when
restricted to graphs arising from RNA folding.
  The bipartite graph present work seeks exact algorithms for solving the
bipartite ordering problem. We demonstrate an algorithm that computes the
optimal ordering in time $O^*(2^n)$ when $n$ is the number of vertices in the
input bipartite graph. Our main result is a general strategy that can be used
to find an optimal ordering in polynomial time for bipartite graphs that
satisfy certain properties. We apply the technique to a variety of graph
classes, obtaining polynomial-time solutions to the bipartite graph ordering
problem for bipartite permutation graphs, trivially perfect, co-bipartite
graphs, and trees."
"Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite undirected graph. An edge set $E' \subseteq E$ is a
dominating induced matching (d.i.m.) in $G$ if every edge in $E$ is intersected
by exactly one edge of $E'$. The Dominating Induced Matching (DIM) problem asks
for the existence of a d.i.m. in $G$; this problem is also known as the
Efficient Edge Domination problem.
  The DIM problem is related to parallel resource allocation problems, encoding
theory and network routing. It is NP-complete even for very restricted graph
classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree three and is
solvable in linear time for $P_7$-free graphs. However, its complexity was open
for $P_k$-free graphs for any $k \ge 8$; $P_k$ denotes the chordless path with
$k$ vertices and $k-1$ edges. We show in this paper that the weighted DIM
problem is solvable in polynomial time for $P_8$-free graphs."
"In a finite undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a vertex $v \in V$ {\em dominates}
itself and its neighbors. A vertex set $D \subseteq V$ in $G$ is an {\em
efficient dominating set} ({\em e.d.} for short) of $G$ if every vertex of $G$
is dominated by exactly one vertex of $D$. The {\em Efficient Domination} (ED)
problem, which asks for the existence of an e.d. in $G$, is known to be
NP-complete for $P_7$-free graphs but solvable in polynomial time for
$P_5$-free graphs. Very recently, it has been shown by Lokshtanov et al. and
independently by Mosca that ED is solvable in polynomial time for $P_6$-free
graphs.
  In this note, we show that, based on modular decomposition, ED is solvable in
linear time for $P_5$-free graphs."
"A Hamilton cycle is a cycle containing every vertex of a graph. A graph is
called Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamilton cycle. The Hamilton cycle problem
is to find the sufficient and necessary condition that a graph is Hamiltonian.
In this paper, we give out some new kind of definitions of the subgraphs and
determine the Hamiltoncity of edges according to the existence of the subgraphs
in a graph, and then obtain a new property of Hamilton graphs as being a
necessary and sufficient condition characterized in the connectivity of the
subgraph that induced from the cycle structure of a given graph."
"Given a bipartite graph G = (A u B, E) with strict preference lists and and
edge e*, we ask if there exists a popular matching in G that contains the edge
e*. We call this the popular edge problem. A matching M is popular if there is
no matching M' such that the vertices that prefer M' to M outnumber those that
prefer M to M'. It is known that every stable matching is popular; however G
may have no stable matching with the edge e* in it. In this paper we identify
another natural subclass of popular matchings called ""dominant matchings"" and
show that if there is a popular matching that contains the edge e*, then there
is either a stable matching that contains e* or a dominant matching that
contains e*. This allows us to design a linear time algorithm for the popular
edge problem. We also use dominant matchings to efficiently test if every
popular matching in G is stable or not."
"The problem of Distance Edge Labeling is a variant of Distance Vertex
Labeling (also known as $L_{2,1}$ labeling) that has been studied for more than
twenty years and has many applications, such as frequency assignment.
  The Distance Edge Labeling problem asks whether the edges of a given graph
can be labeled such that the labels of adjacent edges differ by at least two
and the labels of edges of distance two differ by at least one. Labels are
chosen from the set $\{0,1,\dots,\lambda\}$ for $\lambda$ fixed.
  We present a full classification of its computational complexity - a
dichotomy between the polynomially solvable cases and the remaining cases which
are NP-complete. We characterise graphs with $\lambda \le 4$ which leads to a
polynomial-time algorithm recognizing the class and we show NP-completeness for
$\lambda \ge 5$ by several reductions from Monotone Not All Equal 3-SAT."
"The overlap graphs of subtrees of a tree are equivalent to subtree filament
graphs, the overlap graphs of subtrees of a star are cocomparability graphs,
and the overlap graphs of subtrees of a caterpillar are interval filament
graphs. In this paper, we show the equivalence of many more classes of subtree
overlap and subtree filament graphs, and equate them to classes of complements
of cochordal-mixed graphs. Our results generalize the previously known results
mentioned above."
"The Schelling model of segregation looks to explain the way in which a
population of agents or particles of two types may come to organise itself into
large homogeneous clusters, and can be seen as a variant of the Ising model in
which the system is subjected to rapid cooling. While the model has been very
extensively studied, the unperturbed (noiseless) version has largely resisted
rigorous analysis, with most results in the literature pertaining to versions
of the model in which noise is introduced into the dynamics so as to make it
amenable to standard techniques from statistical mechanics or stochastic
evolutionary game theory. We rigorously analyse the one-dimensional version of
the model in which one of the two types is in the minority, and establish
various forms of threshold behaviour. Our results are in sharp contrast with
the case when the distribution of the two types is uniform (i.e. each agent has
equal chance of being of each type in the initial configuration), which was
studied by Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg."
"A hole is a chordless cycle with at least four vertices. A pan is a graph
which consists of a hole and a single vertex with precisely one neighbor on the
hole. An even hole is a hole with an even number of vertices. We prove that a
(pan, even hole)-free graph can be decomposed by clique cutsets into
essentially unit circular-arc graphs. This structure theorem is the basis of
our $O(nm)$-time certifying algorithm for recognizing (pan, even hole)-free
graphs and for our $O(n^{2.5}+nm)$-time algorithm to optimally color them.
Using this structure theorem, we show that the tree-width of a (pan, even
hole)-free graph is at most 1.5 times the clique number minus 1, and thus the
chromatic number is at most 1.5 times the clique number."
"Motivated by a derandomization of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), this paper
investigates deterministic random walks, which is a deterministic process
analogous to a random walk. While there are several progresses on the analysis
of the vertex-wise discrepancy (i.e., $L_\infty$ discrepancy), little is known
about the {\em total variation discrepancy} (i.e., $L_1$ discrepancy), which
plays a significant role in the analysis of an FPRAS based on MCMC. This paper
investigates upper bounds of the $L_1$ discrepancy between the expected number
of tokens in a Markov chain and the number of tokens in its corresponding
deterministic random walk. First, we give a simple but nontrivial upper bound
${\rm O}(mt^*)$ of the $L_1$ discrepancy for any ergodic Markov chains, where
$m$ is the number of edges of the transition diagram and $t^*$ is the mixing
time of the Markov chain. Then, we give a better upper bound ${\rm
O}(m\sqrt{t^*\log t^*})$ for non-oblivious deterministic random walks, if the
corresponding Markov chain is ergodic and lazy. We also present some lower
bounds."
"We introduce recursive corona graphs as a model of small-world networks. We
investigate analytically the critical characteristics of the model, including
order and size, degree distribution, average path length, clustering
coefficient, and the number of spanning trees, as well as Kirchhoff index.
Furthermore, we study the spectra for the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian
matrix for the model. We obtain explicit results for all the quantities of the
recursive corona graphs, which are similar to those observed in real-life
networks."
"We study the Induced $H$ Partition problem from the parameterized complexity
point of view. In the Induced $H$ Partition problem the task is to partition
vertices of a graph $G$ into sets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_n$ such that the graph $H$
is isomorphic to the subgraph of $G$ induced by each set $V_i$ for $i =
1,2,\dots,n.$ The pattern graph $H$ is fixed.
  For the parametrization we consider three distinct structural parameters of
the graph $G$ - namely the tree-width, the neighborhood diversity, and the
modular-width. For the parametrization by the neighborhood diversity we obtain
an FPT algorithm for every graph $H.$ For the parametrization by the tree-width
we obtain an FPT algorithm for every connected graph $H.$ Finally, for the
parametrization by the modular-width we derive an FPT algorithm for every prime
graph $H.$"
"We characterize trees as median algebras and semilattices by relaxing
conservativeness. Moreover, we describe median homomorphisms between products
of median algebras and show that Arrow type impossibility theorems for mappings
from a product $\mathbf{A}_1\times \cdots \times \mathbf{A}_n$ of median
algebras to a median algebra $\mathbf{B}$ are possible if and only if
$\mathbf{B}$ is a tree, when thought of as an ordered structure."
"An m-clique hole is a sequence $\phi=(\Phi_1,\Phi_2,\dots,\Phi_m)$ of $m$
distinct cliques such that $|\Phi_i| \leq m$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots,m$, and
whose clique graph is a hole on $m$ vertices. That is, $\phi$ is an m-clique
hole if for all $i\neq j$, $i,j=1,2,\ldots,m$, $\Phi_i \cap \Phi_{j} \neq
\emptyset$ if and only if $(j-1)~\mbox{mod}~m = (j+1)~\mbox{mod}~m =
i~\mbox{mod}~m$. This paper derives a sufficient and necessary condition on
m-colorability of m-clique holes, and proposes a coloring algorithm that colors
m-clique holes with exactly m colors."
"Cartesian products of graphs and hypergraphs have been studied since the
1960s. For (un)directed hypergraphs, unique \emph{prime factor decomposition
(PFD)} results with respect to the Cartesian product are known. However, there
is still a lack of algorithms, that compute the PFD of directed hypergraphs
with respect to the Cartesian product.
  In this contribution, we focus on the algorithmic aspects for determining the
Cartesian prime factors of a finite, connected, directed hypergraph and present
a first polynomial time algorithm to compute its PFD. In particular, the
algorithm has time complexity $O(|E||V|r^2)$ for hypergraphs $H=(V,E)$, where
the rank $r$ is the maximum number of vertices contained in an hyperedge of
$H$. If $r$ is bounded, then this algorithm performs even in
$O(|E|\log^2(|V|))$ time. Thus, our method additionally improves also the time
complexity of PFD-algorithms designed for undirected hypergraphs that have time
complexity $O(|E||V|r^6\Delta^6)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum number of
hyperedges a vertex is contained in."
"An oriented graph is a directed graph without any cycle of length at most 2.
To push a vertex of a directed graph is to reverse the orientation of the arcs
incident to that vertex. Klostermeyer and MacGillivray defined push graphs
which are equivalence class of oriented graphs with respect to vertex pushing
operation. They studied the homomorphism of the equivalence classes of oriented
graphs with respect to push operation. In this article, we further study the
same topic and answer some of the questions asked in the above mentioned work.
The anti-twinned graph of an oriented graph is obtained by adding and pushing a
copy of each of its vertices. In particular, we show that two oriented graphs
are in a push relation if and only if they have isomorphic anti-twinned graphs.
Moreover, we study oriented homomorphisms of outerplanar graphs with girth at
least five, planar graphs and planar graphs with girth at least eight with
respect to the push operation."
"An $(m,n)$-colored mixed graph $G$ is a graph with its arcs having one of the
$m$ different colors and edges having one of the $n$ different colors. A
homomorphism $f$ of an $(m,n)$-colored mixed graph $G$ to an $(m,n)$-colored
mixed graph $H$ is a vertex mapping such that if $uv$ is an arc (edge) of color
$c$ in $G$, then $f(u)f(v)$ is an arc (edge) of color $c$ in $H$. The
\textit{$(m,n)$-colored mixed chromatic number} $\chi_{(m,n)}(G)$ of an
$(m,n)$-colored mixed graph $G$ is the order (number of vertices) of the
smallest homomorphic image of $G$. This notion was introduced by
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Raspaud (2000, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B 80, 147--155).
They showed that $\chi_{(m,n)}(G) \leq k(2m+n)^{k-1}$ where $G$ is a
$k$-acyclic colorable graph. We proved the tightness of this bound. We also
showed that the acyclic chromatic number of a graph is bounded by $k^2 + k^{2 +
\lceil log_{(2m+n)} log_{(2m+n)} k \rceil}$ if its $(m,n)$-colored mixed
chromatic number is at most $k$.
  Furthermore, using probabilistic method, we showed that for graphs with
maximum degree $\Delta$ its $(m,n)$-colored mixed chromatic number is at most
$2(\Delta-1)^{2m+n} (2m+n)^{\Delta-1}$. In particular, the last result directly
improves the upper bound $2\Delta^2 2^{\Delta}$ of oriented chromatic number of
graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, obtained by Kostochka, Sopena and Zhu
(1997, J. Graph Theory 24, 331--340) to $2(\Delta-1)^2 2^{\Delta -1}$. We also
show that there exists a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and $(m,n)$-colored
mixed chromatic number at least $(2m+n)^{\Delta / 2}$."
"In a finite undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a vertex $v \in V$ {\em dominates}
itself and its neighbors in $G$. A vertex set $D \subseteq V$ is an {\em
efficient dominating set} ({\em e.d.} for short) of $G$ if every $v \in V$ is
dominated in $G$ by exactly one vertex of $D$. The {\em Efficient Domination}
(ED) problem, which asks for the existence of an e.d. in $G$, is known to be
NP-complete for $P_7$-free graphs but solvable in polynomial time for
$P_5$-free graphs. The $P_6$-free case was the last open question for the
complexity of ED on $F$-free graphs.
  Recently, Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk and van Leeuwen showed that weighted ED is
solvable in polynomial time for $P_6$-free graphs, based on their
sub-exponential algorithm for the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem for
$P_6$-free graphs. Independently, at the same time, Mosca found a polynomial
time algorithm for weighted ED on $P_6$-free graphs using a direct approach. In
this paper, we describe the details of this approach which is simpler and much
faster, namely its time bound is ${\cal O}(n^6 m)$."
"We initiate a general study of what we call orientation completion problems.
For a fixed class C of oriented graphs, the orientation completion problem asks
whether a given partially oriented graph P can be completed to an oriented
graph in C by orienting the (non-oriented) edges in P. Orien- tation completion
problems commonly generalize several existing problems including recognition of
certain classes of graphs and digraphs as well as extending representations of
certain geometrically representable graphs. We study orientation completion
problems for various classes of oriented graphs, including k-arc- strong
oriented graphs, k-strong oriented graphs, quasi-transitive oriented graphs,
local tournament, acyclic local tournaments, locally transitive tournaments,
locally transitive local tournaments, in- tournaments, and oriented graphs
which have directed cycle factors. We show that the orientation completion
problem for each of these classes is either polynomial time solvable or
NP-complete. We also show that some of the NP-complete problems become
polynomial time solvable when the input oriented graphs satisfy certain extra
conditions. Our results imply that the representation extension problems for
proper interval graphs and for proper circular arc graphs are polynomial time
solvable, which generalize a previous result."
"Lexicographic Breadth First Search (LBFS) is one of fundamental graph search
algorithms that has numerous applications, including recognition of graph
classes, computation of graph parameters, and detection of certain graph
structures. The well-known result of Rose, Tarjan and Lueker on the
end-vertices of LBFS of chordal graphs has tempted researchers to study the
end-vertices of LBFS of various classes of graphs, including chordal graphs,
split graphs, interval graphs, and asteroidal triple-free (AT-free) graphs. In
this paper we study the end-vertices of LBFS of bipartite graphs. We show that
deciding whether a vertex of a bipartite graph is the end-vertex of an LBFS is
an NP-complete problem. In contrast we characterize the end-vertices of LBFS of
AT-free bipartite graphs. Our characterization implies that the problem of
deciding whether a vertex of an AT-free bipartite graph is the end-vertex of an
LBFS is solvable in polynomial time. Key words: Lexicographic breadth first
search, end-vertex, bipartite graphs, AT-free, proper interval bigraph,
characterization, algorithm."
"In normal version of combinatorial game theory, all games are invertible,
whereas only the empty game is invertible in mis\`ere version. For this reason,
several restricted universes were earlier considered for their study, in which
more games are invertible. We here study combinatorial games in mis\`ere
version, in particular universes where no player would like to pass their turn
In these universes, we prove that having one extra condition makes all games
become invertible. We then focus our attention on a specific quotient, called
Q_Z, and show that all sums of universes whose quotient is Q_Z also have Q_Z as
their quotient."
"How to quantify the distance between any two partitions of a finite set is an
important issue in statistical classification, whenever different clustering
results need to be compared. Developing from the traditional Hamming distance
between subsets or cardinality of their symmetric difference, this work
considers alternative metric distances between partitions. With one exception,
all of them obtain as minimum-weight paths in the undirected graph
corresponding to the Hasse diagram of the partition lattice. Firstly, by
focusing on the atoms of the lattice, one well-known partition distance is
recognized to be in fact the analog of the Hamming distance between subsets,
with weights on edges of the Hasse diagram determined through the number of
atoms in the unique maximal join-decomposition of partitions. Secondly, another
partition distance known as ""variation of information"" is seen to correspond to
a minimum-weight path with edge weights determined by the entropy of
partitions. These two distances are next compared in terms of their upper and
lower bounds over all pairs of partitions that are complements of one another.
What emerges is that the two distances share the same minimizers and
maximizers, while a much rawer behavior is observed for the partition distance
which does not correspond to a minimum-weight path. The idea of measuring the
distance between partitions by means of minimum-weight paths in the Hasse
diagram is further explored by considering alternative symmetric and
order-preserving/inverting partition functions (such as the the rank, in the
simplest case) for assigning weights to edges. What matters most, in such a
general setting, turns out to be whether the weighting function is supermodular
or else submodular, as this makes any minimum-weight path visit the meet or
else the join of the two partitions, depending on order preserving/inverting."
"In a study on the structure--dependency of the total $\pi$-electron energy
from 1972, Trinajsti\'c and one of the present authors have shown that it
depends on the sums $\sum_{v\in V}d(v)^2$ and $\sum_{v\in V}d(v)^3$, where
$d(v)$ is the degree of a vertex $v$ of the underling molecular graph $G$. The
first sum was later named {\it first Zagreb index} and over the years became
one of the most investigated graph--based molecular structure descriptors. On
the other hand, the second sum, except in very few works on the general first
Zagreb index and the zeroth--order general Randi\'c index, has been almost
completely neglected. Recently, this second sum was named {\em forgotten
index}, or shortly the $F$-{\em index}, and shown to have an exceptional
applicative potential. In this paper we examine the trees extremal with respect
to the $F$-index."
"Given two finite sets of integers $S\subseteq\NNN\setminus\{0\}$ and
$D\subseteq\NNN\setminus\{0,1\}$,the impartial combinatorial game $\IMARK(S,D)$
is played on a heap of tokens. From a heap of $n$ tokens, each player can
moveeither to a heap of $n-s$ tokens for some $s\in S$, or to a heap of $n/d$
tokensfor some $d\in D$ if $d$ divides $n$.Such games can be considered as an
integral variant of \MARK-type games, introduced by Elwyn Berlekamp and Joe
Buhlerand studied by Aviezri Fraenkel and Alan Guo, for which it is allowed to
move from a heap of $n$ tokensto a heap of $\lfloor n/d\rfloor$ tokens for any
$d\in D$.Under normal convention, it is observed that the Sprague-Grundy
sequence of the game $\IMARK(S,D)$ is aperiodic for any sets $S$ and
$D$.However, we prove that, in many cases, this sequence is almost periodic and
that the set of winning positions is periodic.Moreover, in all these cases, the
Sprague-Grundy value of a heap of $n$ tokens can be computed in time $O(\log
n)$.We also prove that, under mis\`ere convention, the outcome sequence of
these games is purely periodic."
"We study convexity properties of graphs. In this paper we present a
linear-time algorithm for the geodetic number in tree-cographs. Settling a
10-year-old conjecture, we prove that the Steiner number is at least the
geodetic number in AT-free graphs. Computing a maximal and proper monophonic
set in $\AT$-free graphs is NP-complete. We present polynomial algorithms for
the monophonic number in permutation graphs and the geodetic number in $P_4$-
sparse graphs."
"Tree representations of (sets of) symmetric binary relations, or equivalently
edge-colored undirected graphs, are of central interest, e.g.\ in
phylogenomics. In this context symbolic ultrametrics play a crucial role.
Symbolic ultrametrics define an edge-colored complete graph that allows to
represent the topology of this graph as a vertex-colored tree. Here, we are
interested in the structure and the complexity of certain combinatorial
problems resulting from considerations based on symbolic ultrametrics, and on
algorithms to solve them.
  This includes, the characterization of symbolic ultrametrics that
additionally distinguishes between edges and non-edges of \emph{arbitrary}
edge-colored graphs $G$ and thus, yielding a tree representation of $G$, by
means of so-called cographs. Moreover, we address the problem of finding
""closest"" symbolic ultrametrics and show the NP-completeness of the three
problems: symbolic ultrametric editing, completion and deletion. Finally, as
not all graphs are cographs, and hence, don't have a tree representation, we
ask, furthermore, what is the minimum number of cotrees needed to represent the
topology of an arbitrary non-cograph $G$. This is equivalent to find an optimal
cograph edge $k$-decomposition $\{E_1,\dots,E_k\}$ of $E$ so that each subgraph
$(V,E_i)$ of $G$ is a cograph. We investigate this problem in full detail,
resulting in several new open problems, and NP-hardness results.
  For all optimization problems proven to be NP-hard we will provide integer
linear program (ILP) formulations to efficiently solve them."
"This paper presents a group-theoretical vector space model (VSM) that extends
the VSM with a group action on a vector space of the VSM. We use group and its
representation theory to represent a dynamic transformation of information
objects, in which each information object is represented by a vector in a
vector space of the VSM. Several groups and their matrix representations are
employed for representing different kinds of dynamic transformations of
information objects used in the VSM. We provide concrete examples of how a
dynamic transformation of information objects is performed and discuss
algebraic properties involving certain dynamic transformations of information
objects used in the VSM."
"There is a common theme to research questions in additive combinatorics and
noise stability. Both study the following basic question: Let $P$ be a
probability distribution over a space $\Omega^\ell$ with all $\ell$ marginals
equal. Let $X^{(1)}, \ldots, X^{(\ell)}$ where $X^{(j)} = (X_1^{(j)}, \ldots,
X_n^{(j)})$, be random vectors such that for every coordinate $i \in [n]$ the
tuples $(X_i^{(1)}, \ldots, X_i^{(\ell)})$ are i.i.d.~according to $P$.
  A central question that is addressed in both areas is: Does there exist a
function $c()$ independent of $n$ such that for every $f: \Omega^n \to [0, 1]$
with $E[f(X^{(1)})] = \mu > 0$: \begin{align*}
  E \left[ \prod_{j=1}^\ell f(X^{(j)}) \right]
  \ge c(\mu) > 0 \; ? \end{align*} Instances of this question include the
Finite Field Model version of Roth's and
  Szemeredi's theorems as well as Borell's result about the optimality of noise
stability of half-spaces.
  Our goal in this paper is to interpolate between the noise stability theory
and the finite field additive combinatorics theory and address the question
above in further generality than considered before. In particular, we settle
the question for $\ell = 2$ and when $\ell > 2$ and $P$ has bounded correlation
$\rho(P) < 1$. Under the same conditions we also characterize the {\em
obstructions} for a similar lower bounds in the case of $k$ different
functions. Part of the novelty in our proof is the combination of analytic
arguments from the theories of influences and hyper-contraction with arguments
from additive combinatorics."
"In this paper we identify some inaccuracies in the paper by R.R. Saxena and
S.R. Arora, A Linearization technique for solving the Quadratic Set Covering
Problem, Optimization, 39 (1997) 33-42. In particular, we observe that their
algorithm need not guarantee optimality, contrary to what is claimed.
Experimental analysis with the algorithm has been carried out to evaluate its
merit as a heuristic and compared with CPLEX. The results disclose that for
some class of problems the algorithm is reasonably effective while for some
other class, it's performance is very poor. we also discussion similar
inaccuracies in another related paper."
"We introduce a square root map on Sturmian words and study its properties.
Given a Sturmian word of slope $\alpha$, there exists exactly six minimal
squares in its language (a minimal square does not have a square as a proper
prefix). A Sturmian word $s$ of slope $\alpha$ can be written as a product of
these six minimal squares: $s = X_1^2 X_2^2 X_3^2 \cdots$. The square root of
$s$ is defined to be the word $\sqrt{s} = X_1 X_2 X_3 \cdots$. The main result
of this paper is that that $\sqrt{s}$ is also a Sturmian word of slope
$\alpha$. Further, we characterize the Sturmian fixed points of the square root
map, and we describe how to find the intercept of $\sqrt{s}$ and an occurrence
of any prefix of $\sqrt{s}$ in $s$. Related to the square root map, we
characterize the solutions of the word equation $X_1^2 X_2^2 \cdots X_n^2 =
(X_1 X_2 \cdots X_n)^2$ in the language of Sturmian words of slope $\alpha$
where the words $X_i^2$ are minimal squares of slope $\alpha$.
  We also study the square root map in a more general setting. We explicitly
construct an infinite set of non-Sturmian fixed points of the square root map.
We show that the subshifts $\Omega$ generated by these words have a curious
property: for all $w \in \Omega$ either $\sqrt{w} \in \Omega$ or $\sqrt{w}$ is
periodic. In particular, the square root map can map an aperiodic word to a
periodic word."
"The reassembling of a simple connected graph G = (V,E) is an abstraction of a
problem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. Its simplest
formulation is in two steps: (1) We cut every edge of G into two halves, thus
obtaining a collection of n=|V| one-vertex components. (2) We splice the two
halves of every edge together, not of all the edges at once, but in some
ordering \Theta of the edges that minimizes two measures that depend on the
edge-boundary degrees of assembled components.
  The edge-boundary degree of a component A (subset of V) is the number of
edges in G with one endpoint in A and one endpoint in V-A. We call the maximum
edge-boundary degree encountered during the reassembling process the
alpha-measure of the reassembling, and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is
its beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp. beta-optimization) of the
reassembling of G is to determine an order \Theta for splicing the edges that
minimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure).
  There are different forms of reassembling. We consider only cases satisfying
the condition that if the an edge between disjoint components A and B is
spliced, then all the edges between A and B are spliced at the same time. In
this report, we examine the particular case of linear reassembling, which
requires that the next edge to be spliced must be adjacent to an already
spliced edge. We delay other forms of reassembling to follow-up reports.
  We prove that alpha-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cutwidth
linear arrangment (CutWidth) are polynomially reducible to each other, and that
beta-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cost linear arrangement
(MinArr) are polynomially reducible to each other."
"Cographs are graphs in which no four vertices induce a simple connected path
$P_4$. Cograph editing is to find for a given graph $G = (V,E)$ a set of at
most $k$ edge additions and deletions that transform $G$ into a cograph. This
combinatorial optimization problem is NP-hard. It has, recently found
applications in the context of phylogenetics, hence good heuristics are of
practical importance.
  It is well-known that the cograph editing problem can be solved independently
on the so-called strong prime modules of the modular decomposition of $G$. We
show here that editing the induced $P_4$'s of a given graph is equivalent to
resolving strong prime modules by means of a newly defined merge operation on
the submodules. This observation leads to a new exact algorithm for the cograph
editing problem that can be used as a starting point for the construction of
novel heuristics."
"The global packing number problem arises from the investigation of optimal
wavelength allocation in an optical network that employs Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM). Consider an optical network that is represented by a
connected, simple graph $G$. We assume all communication channels are
bidirectional, so that all links and paths are undirected. It follows that
there are ${|G|\choose 2}$ distinct node pairs associated with $G$, where $|G|$
is the number of nodes in $G$. A path system $\mathcal{P}$ of $G$ consists of
${|G|\choose 2}$ paths, one path to connect each of the node pairs. The global
packing number of a path system $\mathcal{P}$, denoted by
$\Phi(G,\mathcal{P})$, is the minimum integer $k$ to guarantee the existence of
a mapping $\omega:\mathcal{P}\to\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$, such that
$\omega(P)\neq\omega(P')$ if $P$ and $P'$ have common edge(s). The global
packing number of $G$, denoted by $\Phi(G)$, is defined to be the minimum
$\Phi(G,\mathcal{P})$ among all possible path systems $\mathcal{P}$. If there
is no wavelength conversion along any optical transmission path for any node
pair in the network, the global packing number signifies the minimum number of
wavelengths required to support simultaneous communication for all pairs in the
network.
  In this paper, the focus is on ring networks, so that $G$ is a cycle.
Explicit formulas for the global packing number of a cycle is derived. The
investigation is further extended to chain networks. A path system,
$\mathcal{P}$, that enjoys $\Phi(G,\mathcal{P})=\Phi(G)$ is called ideal. A
characterization of ideal path systems is also presented. We also describe an
efficient heuristic algorithm to assign wavelengths that can be applied to a
general network with more complicated traffic load."
"In this paper we introduce extensions and modifications of the classical
degree sequence graphic realization problem studied by Erd\H{o}s-Gallai and
Havel-Hakimi, as well as of the corresponding connected graphic realization
version. We define the joint-degree matrix graphic (resp. connected graphic)
realization problem, where in addition to the degree sequence, the exact number
of desired edges between vertices of different degree classes is also
specified. We give necessary and sufficient conditions, and polynomial time
decision and construction algorithms for the graphic and connected graphic
realization problems. These problems arise naturally in the current topic of
graph modeling for complex networks. From the technical point of view, the
joint-degree matrix realization algorithm is straightforward. However, the
connected joint-degree matrix realization algorithm involves a novel recursive
search of suitable local graph modifications. Also, we outline directions for
further work of both theoretical and practical interest. In particular, we give
a Markov chain which converges to the uniform distribution over all
realizations. We show that the underline state space is connected, and we leave
the question of the mixing rate open."
"We are interested in the relationships between the number fixed points in a
Boolean network $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$ and its interaction graph, which is
the arc-signed digraph $G$ on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ that describes the positive and
negative influences between the components of the network. A fundamental
theorem of Aracena says that if $G$ has no positive (resp. negative) cycle,
then $f$ has at most (resp. at least) one fixed point; the sign of a cycle
being the product of the signs of its arcs. In this note, we generalize this
result by taking into account the influence of connections between positive and
negative cycles. In particular, we prove that if every positive (resp.
negative) cycle of $G$ has an arc $a$ such that $G\setminus a$ has a
non-trivial initial strongly connected component containing the terminal vertex
of $a$ and only negative (resp. positive) cycles, then $f$ has at most (resp.
at least) one fixed point. This is, up to our knowledge, the first
generalization of Aracena's theorem where the conditions are expressed with $G$
only."
"Given a family of feasible subsets of a ground set, the packing problem is to
find a largest subfamily of pairwise disjoint family members.
Non-approximability renders heuristics attractive viable options, while
efficient methods with worst-case guarantee are a key concern in computational
complexity. This work proposes a novel near-Boolean optimization method relying
on a polynomial multilinear form with variables ranging each in a
high-dimensional unit simplex, rather than in the unit interval as usual. The
variables are the elements of the ground set, and distribute each a unit
membership over those feasible subsets where they are included. The given
problem is thus translated into a continuous version where the objective is to
maximize a function taking values on collections of points in a unit hypercube.
Maximizers are shown to always include collections of hypercube disjoint
vertices, i.e. partitions of the ground set, which constitute feasible
solutions for the original discrete version of the problem. A gradient-based
local search in the expanded continuous domain is designed. Approximations with
polynomial multilinear form of bounded degree and near-Boolean games are also
finally discussed."
"We study the Optimal Linear Arrangement (OLA) problem of Halin graphs, one of
the simplest classes of non-outerplanar graphs. We present several properties
of OLA of general Halin graphs. We prove a lower bound on the cost of OLA of
any Halin graph, and define classes of Halin graphs for which the cost of OLA
matches this lower bound. We show for these classes of Halin graphs, OLA can be
computed in O(n log n), where n is the number of vertices."
"The input of most clustering algorithms is a symmetric matrix quantifying
similarity within data pairs. Such a matrix is here turned into a quadratic set
function measuring cluster score or similarity within data subsets larger than
pairs. In general, any set function reasonably assigning a cluster score to
data subsets gives rise to an objective function-based clustering problem. When
considered in pseudo-Boolean form, cluster score enables to evaluate fuzzy
clusters through multilinear extension MLE, while the global score of fuzzy
clusterings simply is the sum over constituents fuzzy clusters of their MLE
score. This is shown to be no greater than the global score of hard clusterings
or partitions of the data set, thereby expanding a known result on extremizers
of pseudo-Boolean functions. Yet, a multilinear objective function allows to
search for optimality in the interior of the hypercube. The proposed method
only requires a fuzzy clustering as initial candidate solution, for the
appropriate number of clusters is implicitly extracted from the given data set."
"In this paper, we present a cyclically time-expanded network model for
simultaneous optimization of traffic assignment and traffic signal parameters,
in particular offsets, split times, and phase orders. Since travel times are of
great importance for developing realistic solutions for traffic assignment and
traffic signal coordination in urban road networks, we perform an extensive
analysis of the model. We show that a linear time-expanded model can reproduce
realistic travel times especially for use with traffic signals and we verify
this by simulation. Furthermore, we show how exact mathematical programming
techniques can be used for optimizing the control of traffic signals. We
provide computational results for real world instances and demonstrate the
capabilities of the cyclically time-expanded by simulation results obtained
with state-of-the-art traffic simulation tools."
"Spectral clustering is a popular and successful approach for partitioning the
nodes of a graph into clusters for which the ratio of outside connections
compared to the volume (sum of degrees) is small. In order to partition into
$k$ clusters, one first computes an approximation of the first $k$ eigenvectors
of the (normalized) Laplacian of $G$, uses it to embed the vertices of $G$ into
$k$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$, and then partitions the
resulting points via a $k$-means clustering algorithm. It is an important task
for theory to explain the success of spectral clustering.
  Peng et al. (COLT, 2015) made an important step in this direction. They
showed that spectral clustering provably works if the gap between the
$(k+1)$-th and the $k$-th eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian is
sufficiently large. They prove a structural and an algorithmic result. The
algorithmic result needs a considerably stronger gap assumption and does not
analyze the standard spectral clustering paradigm; it replaces spectral
embedding by heat kernel embedding and $k$-means clustering by locality
sensitive hashing.
  We extend their work in two directions. Structurally, we improve the quality
guarantee for spectral clustering by a factor of $k$ and simultaneously weaken
the gap assumption. Algorithmically, we show that the standard paradigm for
spectral clustering works. Moreover, it even works with the same gap assumption
as required for the structural result."
"A \emph{biclique} is a maximal bipartite complete induced subgraph of $G$.
Bicliques have been studied in the last years motivated by the large number of
applications. In particular, enumeration of the maximal bicliques has been of
interest in data analysis. Associated with this issue, bounds on the maximum
number of bicliques were given. In this paper we study bounds on the minimun
number of bicliques of a graph. Since adding false-twin vertices to $G$ does
not change the number of bicliques, we restrict to false-twin-free graphs. We
give a tight lower bound on the minimum number bicliques for a subclass of
$\{C_4$,false-twin$\}$-free graphs and for the class of
$\{K_3$,false-twin$\}$-free graphs. Finally we discuss the problem for general
graphs."
"Graphs are very important mathematical structures used in many applications,
one of which is transportation science. When dealing with transportation
networks, one deals not only with the network structure, but also with
information related to the utilization of the elements of the network, which
can be shown using flow and origin-destination matrices. This paper extends an
algebraic model used to relate all these components by deriving additional
relationships and constructing a more structured understanding of the model.
Specifically, the paper introduces the concept of mutually exclusive matrices,
and shows their effect when decomposing the components of a Hadamard product on
matrices"
"There has been recent work [Louis STOC 2015] to analyze the spectral
properties of hypergraphs with respect to edge expansion. In particular, a
diffusion process is defined on a hypergraph such that within each hyperedge,
measure flows from nodes having maximum weighted measure to those having
minimum. The diffusion process determines a Laplacian, whose spectral
properties are related to the edge expansion properties of the hypergraph.
  It is suggested that in the above diffusion process, within each hyperedge,
measure should flow uniformly in the complete bipartite graph from nodes with
maximum weighted measure to those with minimum. However, we discover that this
method has some technical issues. First, the diffusion process would not be
well-defined. Second, the resulting Laplacian would not have the claimed
spectral properties.
  In this paper, we show that the measure flow between the above two sets of
nodes must be coordinated carefully over different hyperedges in order for the
diffusion process to be well-defined, from which a Laplacian can be uniquely
determined. Since the Laplacian is non-linear, we have to exploit other
properties of the diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning
the ""second eigenvalue"" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that
higher order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current
framework."
"Boolean automata networks (BANs) are a well established model for biological
regulation systems such as neural networks or genetic networks. Studies on the
dynamics of BANs, whether it is synchronous or asynchronous, have mainly
focused on monotonic networks, where fundamental questions on the links
relating their static and dynamical properties have been raised and addressed.
This paper explores analogous questions on asynchronous non-monotonic networks,
xor-BANs, that are BANs where all the local transition functions are
xor-functions. Using algorithmic tools, we give a general characterisation of
the asynchronous transition graphs for most of the cactus xor-BANs and strongly
connected xor-BANs. As an illustration of the results, we provide a complete
description of the asynchronous dynamics of two particular classes of xor-BAN,
namely xor-Flowers and xor-Cycle Chains. This work also leads to new
bisimulation equivalences specific to xor-BANs."
"We propose a new arithmetic for non-empty rooted unordered trees simply
called trees. After discussing tree representation and enumeration, we define
the operations of tree addition, multiplication and stretch, prove their
properties, and show that all trees can be generated from a starting tree of
one vertex. We then show how a given tree can be obtained as the sum or product
of two trees, thus defining prime trees with respect to addition and
multiplication. In both cases we show how primality can be decided in time
polynomial in the number of vertices and we prove that factorization is unique.
We then define negative trees and suggest dealing with tree equations, giving
some preliminary results. Finally we comment on how our arithmetic might be
useful, and discuss preceding studies that have some relations with our. To the
best of our knowledge our approach and results are completely new aside for an
earlier version of this work submitte as an arXiv manuscript."
"The packing chromatic number $\chi_\rho(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest
integer $k$ needed to proper color the vertices of $G$ in such a way the
distance between any two vertices having color $i$ be at least $i+1$. We obtain
$\chi_\rho(H_{q,m})$ for $m=3$, where $H_{q,m}$ is the Hamming graph of words
of length $m$ and alphabet with $q$ symbols, and tabulate bounds of them for $m
\geq 4$ up to 10000 vertices. We also give a polynomial reduction from the
problem of finding $\chi_\rho(G)$ to the Maximum Stable Set problem."
"The minimum number of NOT gates in a logic circuit computing a Boolean
function is called the inversion complexity of the function. In 1957, A. A.
Markov determined the inversion complexity of every Boolean function and proved
that $\lceil\log_{2}(d(f)+1)\rceil$ NOT gates are necessary and sufficient to
compute any Boolean function $f$ (where $d(f)$ is the maximum number of value
changes from greater to smaller over all increasing chains of tuples of
variables values). This result is extended to $k$-valued functions computing in
this paper. Thereupon one can use monotone functions ""for free"" like in the
Boolean case. It is shown that the minimum sufficient number of non-monotone
gates for the realization of the arbitrary $k$-valued logic function $f$ is
equal to $\lceil\log_{2}(d(f)+1)\rceil$ if Post negation (function $x+1
\pmod{k}$) is used in NOT nodes and is also equal to
$\lceil\log_{k}(d(f)+1)\rceil$, if {\L}ukasiewicz negation (function $k-1-x$)
is used in NOT nodes. Similar extension for another classical result of A. A.
Markov for the inversion complexity of a system of Boolean functions to
$k$-valued logic functions has been obtained."
"The max-k-cut problem is to partition the vertices of a weighted graph $G =
(V,E)$ into $k\geq2$ disjoint subsets such that the weight sum of the edges
crossing the different subsets is maximized. The problem is referred as the
max-cut problem when $k=2$. In this work, we present a multiple operator
heuristic (MOH) for the general max-k-cut problem. MOH employs five distinct
search operators organized into three search phases to effectively explore the
search space. Experiments on two sets of 91 well-known benchmark instances show
that the proposed algorithm is highly effective on the max-k-cut problem and
improves the current best known results (new lower bounds) of most of the
tested instances. For the popular special case $k=2$ (i.e., the max-cut
problem), MOH also performs remarkably well by discovering 6 improved best
known results. We provide additional studies to shed light on the alternative
combinations of the employed search operators."
"A gossip protocol is a procedure for spreading secrets among a group of
agents, using a connection graph. We consider distributed gossip protocols
wherein the agents themselves instead of a global scheduler determine whom to
call. In this paper the problem of designing and analyzing gossip protocols is
given a dynamic twist by assuming that when a call is established not only
secrets are exchanged but also telephone numbers. Both numbers and secrets can
be represented by edges in a gossip graph. Thus, each call may change both the
number relation and the secret relation of the graph. We define various such
distributed dynamic gossip protocols, and we characterize them in terms of the
class of graphs where they terminate successfully."
"Given a connected graph $G$ and a terminal set $R \subseteq V(G)$, {\em
Steiner tree} asks for a tree that includes all of $R$ with at most $r$ edges
for some integer $r \geq 0$. It is known from [ND12,Garey et. al
\cite{steinernpc}] that Steiner tree is NP-complete in general graphs. {\em
Split graph} is a graph which can be partitioned into a clique and an
independent set. K. White et. al \cite{white} has established that Steiner tree
in split graphs is NP-complete. In this paper, we present an interesting
dichotomy: we show that Steiner tree on $K_{1,4}$-free split graphs is
polynomial-time solvable, whereas, Steiner tree on $K_{1,5}$-free split graphs
is NP-complete. We investigate $K_{1,4}$-free and $K_{1,3}$-free (also known as
claw-free) split graphs from a structural perspective. Further, using our
structural study, we present polynomial-time algorithms for Steiner tree in
$K_{1,4}$-free and $K_{1,3}$-free split graphs. Although, polynomial-time
solvability of $K_{1,3}$-free split graphs is implied from $K_{1,4}$-free split
graphs, we wish to highlight our structural observations on $K_{1,3}$-free
split graphs which may be used in other combinatorial problems."
"For a connected labelled graph $G$, a {\em spanning tree} $T$ is a connected
and an acyclic subgraph that spans all vertices of $G$. In this paper, we
consider a classical combinatorial problem which is to list all spanning trees
of $G$. A Halin graph is a graph obtained from a tree with no degree two
vertices and by joining all leaves with a cycle. We present a sequential and
parallel algorithm to enumerate all spanning trees in Halin graphs. Our
approach enumerates without repetitions and we make use of $O((2pd)^{p})$
processors for parallel algorithmics, where $d$ and $p$ are the depth, the
number of leaves, respectively, of the Halin graph. We also prove that the
number of spanning trees in Halin graphs is $O((2pd)^{p})$."
"Solitaire {\sc Flood-it}, or {\sc Honey-Bee}, is a game played on a colored
graph. The player resides in a source vertex. Originally his territory is the
maximal connected, monochromatic subgraph that contains the source. A move
consists of calling a color. This conquers all the nodes of the graph that can
be reached by a monochromatic path of that color from the current territory of
the player. It is the aim of the player to add all vertices to his territory in
a minimal number of moves. We show that the minimal number of moves can be
computed in polynomial time when the game is played on AT-free graphs."
"We investigate the Minimum Eccentricity Shortest Path problem in some
structured graph classes. It asks for a given graph to find a shortest path
with minimum eccentricity. Although it is NP-hard in general graphs, we
demonstrate that a minimum eccentricity shortest path can be found in linear
time for distance-hereditary graphs (generalizing the previous result for
trees) and give a generalised approach which allows to solve the problem in
polynomial time for other graph classes. This includes chordal graphs, dually
chordal graphs, graphs with bounded tree-length, and graphs with bounded
hyperbolicity. Additionally, we give a simple algorithm to compute an additive
approximation for graphs with bounded tree-length and graphs with bounded
hyperbolicity."
"A b-coloring of the vertices of a graph is a proper coloring where each color
class contains a vertex which is adjacent to at least one vertex in each other
color class. The b-chromatic number of $G$ is the maximum integer $b(G)$ for
which $G$ has a b-coloring with $b(G)$ colors. This problem was introduced by
Irving and Manlove in 1999, where they showed that computing $b(G)$ is
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard in general and polynomial-time solvable for trees. Since
then, a number of complexity results were shown, including NP-hardness results
for chordal graphs (Havet et. al., 2011) and line graphs (Campos et. al.,
2015). In this article, we present a polynomial time algorithm that solves the
problem restricted to claw-free block graphs, an important subclass of chordal
graphs and line graphs. This is equivalent to solving the edge coloring version
of the problem restricted to trees."
"Ruskey and Savage in 1993 asked whether every matching in a hypercube can be
extended to a Hamiltonian cycle. A positive answer is known for perfect
matchings, but the general case has been resolved only for matchings of linear
size. In this paper we show that there is a quadratic function $q(n)$ such that
every matching in the $n$-dimensional hypercube of size at most $q(n)$ may be
extended to a cycle which covers at least $\frac34$ of the vertices."
"The Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem on finite undirected graphs
with vertex weights asks for a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices of maximum
weight sum. MWIS is one of the most investigated and most important algorithmic
graph problems; it is well known to be NP-complete, and it remains NP-complete
even under various strong restrictions such as for triangle-free graphs. Its
complexity was an open problem for $P_k$-free graphs, $k \ge 5$. Recently,
Lokshtanov, Vatshelle, and Villanger proved that MWIS can be solved in
polynomial time for $P_5$-free graphs, and Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, and van
Leeuwen proved that MWIS can be solved in quasi-polynomial time for $P_6$-free
graphs. It still remains an open problem whether MWIS can be solved in
polynomial time for $P_k$-free graphs, $k \geq 6$ or in quasi-polynomial time
for $P_k$-free graphs, $k \geq 7$. Some characterizations of $P_k$-free graphs
and some progress are known in the literature but so far did not solve the
problem. In this paper, we show that MWIS can be solved in polynomial time for
($P_7$,triangle)-free graphs. This extends the corresponding result for
($P_6$,triangle)-free graphs and may provide some progress in the study of MWIS
for $P_7$-free graphs."
"Optical orthogonal signature pattern codes (OOSPCs) play an important role in
a novel type of optical code-division multiple-access (CDMA) network for
2-dimensional image transmission. There is a one-to-one correspondence between
an $(m, n, w, \lambda)$-OOSPC and a $(\lambda+1)$-$(mn,w,1)$ packing design
admitting an automorphism group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_m\times
\mathbb{Z}_n$. In 2010, Sawa gave the first infinite class of $(m, n, 4,
2)$-OOSPCs by using $S$-cyclic Steiner quadruple systems. In this paper, we use
various combinatorial designs such as strictly $\mathbb{Z}_m\times
\mathbb{Z}_n$-invariant $s$-fan designs, strictly $\mathbb{Z}_m\times
\mathbb{Z}_n$-invariant $G$-designs and rotational Steiner quadruple systems to
present some constructions for $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPCs. As a consequence, our new
constructions yield more infinite families of optimal $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPCs.
Especially, we shall see that in some cases an optimal $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPC can
not achieve the Johnson bound."
"Large real-world networks are typically scale-free. Recent research has shown
that such graphs are described best in a geometric space. More precisely, the
internet can be mapped to a hyperbolic space such that geometric greedy routing
performs close to optimal (Bogun\'a, Papadopoulos, and Krioukov. Nature
Communications, 1:62, 2010). This observation pushed the interest in hyperbolic
networks as a natural model for scale-free networks. Hyperbolic random graphs
follow a power-law degree distribution with controllable exponent $\beta$ and
show high clustering (Gugelmann, Panagiotou, and Peter. ICALP, pp. 573-585,
2012).
  For understanding the structure of the resulting graphs and for analyzing the
behavior of network algorithms, the next question is bounding the size of the
diameter. The only known explicit bound is $\mathcal O((\log
n)^{32/((3-\beta)(5-\beta)) + 1})$ (Kiwi and Mitsche. ANALCO, pp. 26-39, 2015).
We present two much simpler proofs for an improved upper bound of $\mathcal
O((\log n)^{2/(3-\beta)})$ and a lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$."
"The maximum graph bisection problem is a well known graph partition problem.
The problem has been proven to be NP-hard. In the maximum graph bisection
problem it is required that the set of vertices is divided into two partition
with equal number of vertices, and the weight of the edge cut is maximal.
  This work introduces a connected multidimensional generalization of the
maximum bisection problem. In this problem the weights on edges are vectors of
positive numbers rather than numbers and partitions should be connected. A
mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed with the proof of its
correctness. The MILP formulation of the problem has polynomial number of
variables and constraints."
"In this paper we provide some sufficient conditions for the existence of an
odd or even cycle that passing a given vertex or an edge in $2$-connected or
$2$-edge connected graphs. We provide some similar conditions for the existence
of an odd or even circuit that passing a given vertex or an edge in 2-edge
connected graphs. We show that if $G$ is a $2$-connected $k$-regular graph, $k
\geq 3$, then every edge of $G$ is contained in an even cycle. We also prove
that in a $2$-edge connected graph, if a vertex has odd degree, then there is
an even cycle containing this vertex."
"The graph isomorphism problem is considered. We assign modified
characteristic polynomials for graphs and reduce the graph isomorphism problem
to the following one. It is required to find out, is there such an enumeration
of the graphs vertices that the polynomials of the graphs are equal. We present
algorithms for the graph isomorphism problem that use the reduction. We prove
the propositions that justify the possibility of a numerical realization of the
algorithms for the general case of the graph isomorphism problem. The
algorithms perform equality checking of graphs modified $n$-variables
characteristic polynomials. We show that probability of obtaining a wrong
solution of the graph isomorphism problem using recursive modification of the
algorithm is negligible if the algorithm parameter is sufficiently large. In
the course of its implementation, the algorithm checks the equality of the
graphs modified characteristic polynomials in predefined points. For
$n$-vertices graph, the polynomial has $2^n$ coefficients so its value in some
point cannot be evaluated directly for large enough $n$. We show that we may
check the equality of the polynomials in predefined points without direct
evaluation of the polynomials values in these points. We prove that, for the
graphs on $n$ vertices, it is required $O(n^4)$ elementary machine operations
and it is requred machine numbers with mantissa's length $O(n^2)$ to check
equality of the graphs polynomials values in predefined points. In general, it
needs an exponential time to solve the $GI$ instance using the presented
approach, but in practice, it is efficient even for compuationally hard
instances of the graph isomorphism problem."
"What is a least integer upper bound on van der Waerden number $W(r, k)$ among
the powers of the integer $r$? We show how this can be found by expanding the
integer $W(r, k)$ into powers of $r$. Doing this enables us to find both a
least upper bound and a greatest lower bound on $W(r, k)$ that are some powers
of $r$ and where the greatest lower bound is equal to or smaller than $W(r,
k)$. A finite series expansion of each $W(r, k)$ into integer powers of $r$
then helps us to find also a greatest real lower bound on any $k$ for which a
conjecture posed by R. Graham is true, following immediately as a particular
case of the overall result."
"Co-clustering, that is, partitioning a numerical matrix into homogeneous
submatrices, has many applications ranging from bioinformatics to election
analysis. Many interesting variants of co-clustering are NP-hard. We focus on
the basic variant of co-clustering where the homogeneity of a submatrix is
defined in terms of minimizing the maximum distance between two entries. In
this context, we spot several NP-hard as well as a number of relevant
polynomial-time solvable special cases, thus charting the border of tractabil-
ity for this challenging data clustering problem. For instance, we provide
polynomial-time solvability when having to partition the rows and columns into
two subsets each (meaning that one obtains four submatrices). When partitioning
rows and columns into three subsets each, however, we encounter NP-hardness
even for input matrices containing only values from {0, 1, 2}."
"It is known that the maximum cardinality cut problem is NP-hard even in
chordal graphs. In this paper, we consider the time complexity of the problem
in proper interval graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs, and propose a dynamic
programming algorithm which runs in polynomial-time."
"(i) We provide a short and simple proof of the first selection lemma. (ii) We
also prove a selection lemma of a new type in $\Re^d$. For example, when $d=2$
assuming $n$ is large enough we prove that for any set $P$ of $n$ points in
general position there are $\Omega(n^4)$ pairs of segments spanned by $P$ all
of which intersect in some fixed triangle spanned by $P$. (iii) Finally, we
extend the weak $\frac{1}{r}$-net theorem to a kinetic setting where the
underlying set of points is moving polynomially with bounded description
complexity. We establish that one can find a kinetic analog $N$ of a weak
$\frac{1}{r}$-net of cardinality $O(r^{\frac{d(d+1)}{2}}\log^{d}r)$ whose
points are moving with coordinates that are rational functions with bounded
description complexity. Moreover, each member of $N$ has one polynomial
coordinate."
"In this paper we present a novel methodology based on a topological entropy,
the so-called persistent entropy, for addressing the comparison between
discrete piecewise linear functions. The comparison is certified by the
stability theorem for persistent entropy. The theorem is used in the
implementation of a new algorithm. The algorithm transforms a discrete
piecewise linear function into a filtered simplicial complex that is analyzed
with persistent homology and persistent entropy. Persistent entropy is used as
discriminant feature for solving the supervised classification problem of real
long length noisy signals of DC electrical motors. The quality of
classification is stated in terms of the area under receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC=94.52%)."
"We present a simple algorithm for estimating the cardinality of a set $I$,
based on a $RandomSample(I)$ primitive that returns an element of $I$ uniformly
at random. Our algorithm with probability $(1-p_{err})$ returns an estimate of
$|I|$ accurate within a factor $(1\pm\delta_{err})$ invoking $RandomSample(I)$
at most
$O\big(\frac{1}{\delta_{err}}\sqrt{\log(\frac{1}{p_{err}})}\sqrt{|I|}\big)$
times (for
$\frac{1}{\delta_{err}}\sqrt{\log(\frac{1}{p_{err}})}=O(\sqrt{|I|})$)."
"An arbitrary $m\times n$ Boolean matrix $M$ can be decomposed {\em exactly}
as $M =U\circ V$, where $U$ (resp. $V$) is an $m\times k$ (resp. $k\times n$)
Boolean matrix and $\circ$ denotes the Boolean matrix multiplication operator.
We first prove an exact formula for the Boolean matrix $J$ such that $M =M\circ
J^T$ holds, where $J$ is maximal in the sense that if any 0 element in $J$ is
changed to a 1 then this equality no longer holds. Since minimizing $k$ is
NP-hard, we propose two heuristic algorithms for finding suboptimal but good
decomposition. We measure the performance (in minimizing $k$) of our algorithms
on several real datasets in comparison with other representative heuristic
algorithms for Boolean matrix decomposition (BMD). The results on some popular
benchmark datasets demonstrate that one of our proposed algorithms performs as
well or better on most of them. Our algorithms have a number of other
advantages: They are based on exact mathematical formula, which can be
interpreted intuitively. They can be used for approximation as well with
competitive ""coverage."" Last but not least, they also run very fast. Due to
interpretability issues in data mining, we impose the condition, called the
""column use condition,"" that the columns of the factor matrix $U$ must form a
subset of the columns of $M$."
"Given a complete graph $K_{n}=(V, E)$ with non-negative edge costs $c\in
{\mathbb R}^{E}$, the problem $2EC$ is that of finding a 2-edge connected
spanning multi-subgraph of $K_{n}$ of minimum cost. The integrality gap
$\alpha\text{2EC}$ of the linear programming relaxation
$\text{2EC}^{\text{LP}}$ for $2EC$ has been conjectured to be $\frac{6}{5}$,
although currently we only know that
$\frac{6}{5}\leq\alpha\text{2EC}\leq\frac{3}{2}$. In this paper, we explore the
idea of using the structure of solutions for $\text{2EC}^{\text{LP}}$ and the
concept of convex combination to obtain improved bounds for $\alpha\text{2EC}$.
We focus our efforts on a family $J$ of half-integer solutions that appear to
give the largest integrality gap for $\text{2EC}^{\text{LP}}$. We successfully
show that the conjecture $\alpha\text{2EC} = \frac{6}{5}$ is true for any cost
functions optimized by some $x^{*}\in J$."
"We propose general separation procedures for generating cuts for the stable
set polytope, inspired by a procedure by Rossi and Smriglio and applying a
lifting method by Xavier and Camp\^{e}lo. In contrast to existing
cut-generating procedures, ours generate both rank and non-rank valid
inequalities, hence they are of a more general nature than existing methods.
This is accomplished by iteratively solving a lifting problem, which consists
of a maximum weighted stable set problem on a smaller graph. Computational
experience on DIMACS benchmark instances shows that the proposed approach may
be a useful tool for generating cuts for the stable set polytope."
"We consider the problem of online graph colouring. Whenever a node is
requested, a colour must be assigned to the node, and this colour must be
different from the colours of any of its neighbours. According to the greedy
algorithm the node is coloured by the colour with the smallest possible $k$.
  The goal is to use as few colours as possible. We propose an algorithm, where
the node is coloured not immediately, but only after the collection of next
requests stored in the buffer of size $j$. In other words, the first node in
the buffer is coloured definitively taking into account all possible
colourisations of the remaining nodes in the buffer. If there are $r$ possible
corrected colourings, then the one with the probability $1/r$ is chosen. The
first coloured node is removed from the buffer to enable the entrance of the
next request. A number of colours in a two examples of graphs: crown graphs and
Kneser graphs have been analysed."
"We consider a constrained shortest path problem with two resources. These two
resources can be converted into each other in a particular manner. Our
practical application is the energy optimal routing of hybrid vehicles. Due to
the possibility of converting fuel into electric energy this setting adds new
characteristics and new combinatorial possibilities to the common constrained
shortest path problem (CSP). We formulate the resulting problem as a
generalization of CSP. We show that optimal paths in this model may contain
cycles and we state conditions to prevent them. The main contribution is a
polynomial-time approximation scheme and a simpler approximation algorithm for
computing energy-optimal paths in graphs."
"A permutation on an alphabet $ \Sigma $, is a sequence where every element in
$ \Sigma $ occurs precisely once. Given a permutation $ \pi $= ($\pi_{1} $, $
\pi_{2} $, $ \pi_{3} $,....., $ \pi_{n} $) over the alphabet $ \Sigma $ =$\{
$0, 1, . . . , n$-$1 $\}$ the elements in two consecutive positions in $ \pi $
e.g. $ \pi_{i} $ and $ \pi_{i+1} $ are said to form an \emph{adjacency} if $
\pi_{i+1} $ =$ \pi_{i} $+1. The concept of adjacencies is widely used in
computation. The set of permutations over $ \Sigma $ forms a symmetric group,
that we call P$ _{n} $. The identity permutation, I$ _{n}$ $\in$ P$_{n}$ where
I$_{n}$ =(0,1,2,...,n$-$1) has exactly n$ - $1 adjacencies. Likewise, the
reverse order permutation R$_{n} (\in P_{n})$=(n$-$1, n$-$2, n$-$3, n$-$4,
...,0) has no adjacencies. We denote the set of permutations in P$_{n} $ with
exactly k adjacencies with P$_{n} $(k). We study variations of adjacency. % A
transposition exchanges adjacent sublists; when one of the sublists is
restricted to be a prefix (suffix) then one obtains a prefix (suffix)
transposition. We call the operations: transpositions, prefix transpositions
and suffix transpositions as block-moves. A particular type of adjacency and a
particular block-move are closely related. In this article we compute the
cardinalities of P$_{n}$(k) i.e. $ \forall_k \mid $P$ _{n} $ (k) $ \mid $ for
each type of adjacency in $O(n^2)$ time. Given a particular adjacency and the
corresponding block-move, we show that $\forall_{k} \mid P_{n}(k)\mid$ and the
expected number of moves to sort a permutation in P$_{n} $ are closely related.
Consequently, we propose a model to estimate the expected number of moves to
sort a permutation in P$_{n} $ with a block-move. We show the results for
prefix transposition. Due to symmetry, these results are also applicable to
suffix transposition."
"The GAI (Generalized Additive Independence) model proposed by Fishburn is a
generalization of the additive utility model, which need not satisfy mutual
preferential independence. Its great generality makes however its application
and study difficult. We consider a significant subclass of GAI models, namely
the discrete 2-additive GAI models, and provide for this class a decomposition
into nonnegative monotone terms. This decomposition allows a reduction from
exponential to quadratic complexity in any optimization problem involving
discrete 2-additive models, making them usable in practice."
"In this article we prove that, restricted to the row-constrained case,
effective sets of colourings in the $2$-fold horocyclic tessellations of the
hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ are sofic."
"In this paper we give a detailed analysis of deterministic and randomized
algorithms that enumerate any number of irreducible polynomials of degree $n$
over a finite field and their roots in the extension field in quasilinear where
$N=n^2$ is the size of the output.} time cost per element.
  Our algorithm is based on an improved algorithm for enumerating all the
Lyndon words of length $n$ in linear delay time and the known reduction of
Lyndon words to irreducible polynomials."
"The Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem is a well-known NP-hard
problem. For graphs $G_1, G_2$, $G_1+G_2$ denotes the disjoint union of $G_1$
and $G_2$, and for a constant $l \ge 2$, $lG$ denotes the disjoint union of $l$
copies of $G$. A {\em claw} has vertices $a,b,c,d$, and edges $ab,ac,ad$. MWIS
can be solved for claw-free graphs in polynomial time; the first two polynomial
time algorithms were introduced in 1980 by \cite{Minty1980,Sbihi1980}, then
revisited by \cite{NakTam2001}, and recently improved by
\cite{FaeOriSta2011,FaeOriSta2014}, and by \cite{NobSas2011,NobSas2015} with
the best known time bound in \cite{NobSas2015}. Furthermore MWIS can be solved
for the following extensions of claw-free graphs in polynomial time: fork-free
graphs \cite{LozMil2008}, $K_2$+claw-free graphs \cite{LozMos2005}, and
apple-free graphs \cite{BraLozMos2010,BraKleLozMos2008}.
  This manuscript shows that for any constant $l$, MWIS can be solved for
$l$claw-free graphs in polynomial time. Our approach is based on Farber's
approach showing that every $2K_2$-free graph has ${\cal O}(n^2)$ maximal
independent sets \cite{Farbe1989}, which directly leads to a polynomial time
algorithm for MWIS on $2K_2$-free graphs by dynamic programming.
  Solving MWIS for $l$claw-free graphs in polynomial time extends known results
for claw-free graphs, for $lK_2$-free graphs for any constant $l$
\cite{Aleks1991,FarHujTuz1993,Prisn1995,TsuIdeAriShi1977}, for $K_2$+claw-free
graphs, for $2P_3$-free graphs \cite{LozMos2012}, and solves the open questions
for $2K_2+P_3$-free graphs and for $P_3$+claw-free graphs being two of the
minimal graph classes, defined by forbidding one induced subgraph, for which
the complexity of MWIS was an open problem."
"Motivated by the fact that in several cases a matching in a graph is stable
if and only if it is produced by a greedy algorithm, we study the problem of
computing a maximum weight greedy matching on weighted graphs, termed
GreedyMatching. In wide contrast to the maximum weight matching problem, for
which many efficient algorithms are known, we prove that GreedyMatching is
strongly NP-hard and APX-complete, and thus it does not admit a PTAS unless
P=NP, even on graphs with maximum degree at most 3 and with at most three
different integer edge weights. Furthermore we prove that GreedyMatching is
strongly NP-hard if the input graph is in addition bipartite. Moreover we
consider two natural parameters of the problem, for which we establish a sharp
threshold behavior between NP-hardness and tractability. On the positive side,
we present a randomized approximation algorithm (RGMA) for GreedyMatching on a
special class of weighted graphs, called bush graphs. We highlight an
unexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality
matching in unweighted graphs via randomized greedy algorithms. We show that,
if the approximation ratio of RGMA is $\rho$, then for every $\epsilon>0$ the
randomized MRG algorithm of [Aronson et al., Rand. Struct. Alg. 1995] gives a
$(\rho-\epsilon)$-approximation for the maximum cardinality matching. We
conjecture that a tight bound for $\rho$ is $\frac{2}{3}$; we prove our
conjecture true for two subclasses of bush graphs. Proving a tight bound for
the approximation ratio of MRG on unweighted graphs (and thus also proving a
tight value for $\rho$) is a long-standing open problem [Poloczek and Szegedy;
FOCS 2012]. This unexpected relation of our RGMA algorithm with the MRG
algorithm may provide new insights for solving this problem."
"A difference equation based method of determining two factors of a composite
is presented. The feasibility of P-complexity is shown. Presentation of
material is non-theoretical; intended to be accessible to a broader audience of
non academic and theoretical practitioners."
"Triadic Formal Concept Analysis (3FCA) was introduced by Lehman and Wille
almost two decades ago. And many researchers work in Data Mining and Formal
Concept Analysis using the notions of closed sets, Galois and closure
operators, closure systems, but up-to-date even though that different
researchers actively work on mining triadic and n-ary relations, a proper
closure operator for enumeration of triconcepts, i.e. maximal triadic cliques
of tripartite hypergaphs, was not introduced. In this paper we show that the
previously introduced operators for obtaining triconcepts and maximal connected
and complete sets (MCCSs) are not always consistent and provide the reader with
a definition of valid closure operator and associated set system. Moreover, we
study the difficulties of related problems from order-theoretic and
combinatorial point view as well as provide the reader with justifications of
the complexity classes of these problems."
"The deterministic random walk is a deterministic process analogous to a
random walk. While there are some results on the cover time of the rotor-router
model, which is a deterministic random walk corresponding to a simple random
walk, nothing is known about the cover time of deterministic random walks
emulating general transition probabilities. This paper is concerned with the
SRT-router model with multiple tokens, which is a deterministic process coping
with general transition probabilities possibly containing irrational numbers.
For the model, we give an upper bound of the cover time, which is the first
result on the cover time of deterministic random walks for general transition
probabilities. Our upper bound also improves the existing bounds for the
rotor-router model in some cases."
"A graph with n vertices is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane such that
each edge is crossed at most once, and is optimal if it has the maximum of 4n-8
edges.
  We show that optimal 1-planar graphs can be recognized in linear time. Our
algorithm implements a graph reduction system with two rules, which can be used
to reduce every optimal 1-planar graph to an irreducible extended wheel graph.
The graph reduction system is non-deterministic, constraint, and non-confluent."
"We revisit a concept that has been central in some early stages of computer
science, that of structured programming: a set of rules that an algorithm must
follow in order to acquire a structure that is desirable in many aspects. While
much has been written about structured programming, an important issue has been
left unanswered: given an arbitrary, compiled program, describe an algorithm to
decide whether or not it is structured, that is, whether it conforms to the
stated principles of structured programming. We refer to the classical concept
of structured programming, as described by Dijkstra. By employing a graph model
and graph-theoretic techniques, we formulate an efficient algorithm for
answering this question. To do so, we first introduce the class of graphs which
correspond to structured programs, which we call Dijkstra Graphs. Our problem
then becomes the recognition of such graphs, for which we present a greedy
$O(n)$-time algorithm. Furthermore, we describe an isomorphism algorithm for
Dijkstra graphs, whose complexity is also linear in the number of vertices of
the graph. Both the recognition and isomorphism algorithms have potential
important applications, such as in code similarity analysis."
"A 2-distance k-coloring of a graph G is a mapping from V (G) to the set of
colors {1,. .. , k} such that every two vertices at distance at most 2 receive
distinct colors. The 2-distance chromatic number $\chi$ 2 (G) of G is then the
mallest k for which G admits a 2-distance k-coloring. For any finite set of
positive integers D = {d 1 ,. .. , d k }, the integer distance graph G = G(D)
is the infinite graph defined by V (G) = Z and uv $\in$ E(G) if and only if |v
-- u| $\in$ D. We study the 2-distance chromatic number of integer distance
graphs for several types of sets D. In each case, we provide exact values or
upper bounds on this parameter and characterize those graphs G(D) with $\chi$ 2
(G(D)) = {\Delta}(G(D)) + 1."
"Weighted independent domination is an NP-hard graph problem, which remains
computationally intractable in many restricted graph classes. In particular,
the problem is NP-hard in the classes of sat-graphs and chordal graphs. We
strengthen these results by showing that the problem is NP-hard in a proper
subclass of the intersection of sat-graphs and chordal graphs. On the other
hand, we identify two new classes of graphs where the problem admits
polynomial-time solutions."
"A graph $G$ is \emph{equimatchable} if every maximal matching of $G$ has the
same cardinality. We are interested in equimatchable graphs such that the
removal of any edge from the graph preserves the equimatchability. We call an
equimatchable graph $G$ \emph{edge-stable} if $G\setminus {e}$ is equimatchable
for any $e \in E(G)$. After noticing that edge-stable equimatchable graphs are
either 2-connected factor-critical or bipartite, we characterize edge-stable
equimatchable graphs. This characterization yields an $O(\min(n^{3.376},
n^{1.5}m))$ time recognition algorithm. We also define \emph{vertex-stable}
equimatchable graphs and show that they admit a simpler characterization.
Lastly, we introduce and shortly discuss the related notions of
\emph{edge-critical} and \emph{vertex-critical} equimatchable graphs, pointing
out the most interesting case in their characterization as an open question."
"Despite its long history, the classical game of peg solitaire continues to
attract the attention of the scientific community. In this paper, we consider
two problems with an algorithmic flavour which are related with this game,
namely Solitaire-Reachability and Solitaire-Army. In the first one, we show
that deciding whether there is a sequence of jumps which allows a given initial
configuration of pegs to reach a target position is NP-complete. Regarding
Solitaire-Army, the aim is to successfully deploy an army of pegs in a given
region of the board in order to reach a target position. By solving an
auxiliary problem with relaxed constraints, we are able to answer some open
questions raised by Cs\'ak\'any and Juh\'asz (Mathematics Magazine, 2000). To
appreciate the combinatorial beauty of our solutions, we recommend to visit the
gallery of animations provided at http://solitairearmy.isnphard.com."
"In this paper we introduce k-laminar graphs a new class of graphs which
extends the idea of Asteroidal triple free graphs. Indeed a graph is k-laminar
if it admits a diametral path that is k-dominating. This bio-inspired class of
graphs was motivated by a biological application dealing with sequence
similarity networks of reads (called hereafter read networks for short). We
briefly develop the context of the biological application in which this graph
class appeared and then we consider the relationships of this new graph class
among known graph classes and then we study its recognition problem. For the
recognition of k-laminar graphs, we develop polynomial algorithms when k is
fixed. For k=1, our algorithm improves a Deogun and Krastch's algorithm (1999).
We finish by an NP-completeness result when k is unbounded."
"There is a sizable literature on investigating the minimum and maximum
numbers of cycles in a class of graphs. However, the answer is known only for
special classes. This paper presents a result on the smallest number of cycles
in hamiltonian 3-connected cubic graphs. Further, it describes a proof
technique that could improve an upper bound of the largest number of cycles in
a hamiltonian graph."
"We consider network models where information items flow %are sent from a
source to a sink node. We start with a model where routing is constrained by
energy available on nodes in finite supply (like in Smartdust) and efficiency
is related to energy consumption. We characterize graph topologies ensuring
that every saturating flow under every energy-to-node assignment is maximum and
provide a polynomial-time algorithm for checking this property. We then
consider the standard flow networks with capacity on edges, where again
efficiency is related to maximality of saturating flows, and a traffic model
for selfish routing, where efficiency is related to latency at a Wardrop
equilibrium. Finally, we show that all these forms of inefficiency yield
different classes of graphs (apart from the acyclic case, where the last two
forms generate the same class). Interestingly, in all cases inefficient graphs
can be made efficient by removing edges; this resembles a well-known
phenomenon, called Braess's paradox."
"The concepts of orthology, paralogy, and xenology play a key role in
molecular evolution. Orthology and paralogy distinguish whether a pair of genes
originated by speciation or duplication. The corresponding binary relations on
a set of genes form complementary cographs. Allowing more than two types of
ancestral event types leads to symmetric symbolic ultrametrics. Horizontal gene
transfer, which leads to xenologous gene pairs, however, is inherent asymmetric
since one offspring copy ""jumps"" into another genome, while the other continues
to be inherited vertically. We therefore explore here the mathematical
structure of the non-symmetric generalization of symbolic ultrametrics. Our
main results tie non-symmetric ultrametrics together with di-cographs (the
directed generalization of cographs), so-called uniformly non-prime
2-structures, and hierarchical structures on the set of strong modules. This
yields a characterization of relation structures that can be explained in terms
of trees and types of ancestral events. This framework accommodates a
horizontal-transfer relation in terms of an ancestral event and thus, is
slightly different from the the most commonly used definition of xenology."
"Reconstructing the evolutionary past of a family of genes is an important
aspect of many genomic studies. To help with this, simple operations on a set
of sequences called orthology relations may be employed. In addition to being
interesting from a practical point of view they are also attractive from a
theoretical perspective in that e. g. a characterization is known for when such
a relation is representable by a certain type of phylogenetic tree. For an
orthology relation inferred from real biological data it is however generally
too much to hope for that it satisfies that characterization. Rather than
trying to correct the data in some way or another which has its own drawbacks,
as an alternative, we propose to represent an orthology relation $\delta$ in
terms of a structure more general than a phylogenetic tree called a
phylogenetic network. To compute such a network in the form of a level-1
representation for $\delta$, we introduce the novel {\sc Network-Popping}
algorithm which has several attractive properties. In addition, we characterize
orthology relations $\delta$ on some set $X$ that have a level-1 representation
in terms of eight natural properties for $\delta$ as well as in terms for
level-1 representations of orthology relations on certain subsets of $X$."
"Measures for the overall similarity of partitions
$\mathcal{P}=\{P_1,\dots,P_{\vert\mathcal{P}\vert}\}$ and
$\mathcal{P}'=\{P'_1,\dots,P'_{\vert\mathcal{P}'\vert}\}$ of the same set $V$
do not provide specifics on how $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}'$ correspond,
e.g., when the union of two parts in $\mathcal{P}$ is similar to that of three
parts in $\mathcal{P}'$.
  We think of a good correspondence between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}'$ as
a pair $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{S}')$ with $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{P}$,
$\mathcal{S}'\subseteq \mathcal{P}'$ and a low value of
$\vert(\bigcup_{S\in\mathcal{S}}S)\triangle(\bigcup_{S'\in\mathcal{S}'}S')\vert$,
where $\triangle$ and $\vert\cdot\vert$ denote symmetric difference and
cardinality [total weight] if the elements of $V$ are unweighted [weighted].
Such an objective function is essentially one for
$\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{P}$ only and yields the weight of the cut
$(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{P} \setminus \mathcal{S})$ w.r.t. $\mathcal{P}'$}.
  Thus, we can derive a hierarchy of the $\vert\mathcal{P}-1\vert$ best
correspondences from a minimal cut basis of $\mathcal{P}$. A minimal
$P_s$-$P_t$ cut can be computed in time $O(\vert
V\vert+\vert\mathcal{P}\vert^4\vert\mathcal{P}'\vert)$.
  To reduce the running time in practice, we present a branch-and-bound
algorithm for finding minimal $P_s$-$P_t$ cuts. When the entire cut basis needs
to be computed, the algorithm is feasible up to
$\vert\mathcal{P}\vert,\vert\mathcal{P}'\vert$ around 1000. The number of
elements in $V$ can be neglected.
  Finally, we use correspondences to gain insight into a parallel community
detection algorithm that is non-deterministic due to race conditions and that
has an optional refinement phase. It turns out that the race conditions
frequently entail unions or break-ups of communities, while the refinement
leaves most communities intact."
"We present novel families of wavelets and associated filterbanks for the
analysis and representation of functions defined on circulant graphs. In this
work, we leverage the inherent vanishing moment property of the circulant graph
Laplacian operator, and by extension, the e-graph Laplacian, which is
established as a parameterization of the former with respect to the degree per
node, for the design of vertex-localized and critically-sampled higher-order
graph (e-)spline wavelet filterbanks, which can reproduce and annihilate
classes of (exponential) polynomial signals on circulant graphs. In addition,
we discuss similarities and analogies of the detected properties and resulting
constructions with splines and spline wavelets in the Euclidean domain.
Ultimately, we consider generalizations to arbitrary graphs in the form of
graph approximations, with focus on graph product decompositions. In
particular, we proceed to show how the use of graph products facilitates a
multi-dimensional extension of the proposed constructions and properties."
"We are given a bipartite graph $G = (A \cup B, E)$ where each vertex has a
preference list ranking its neighbors: in particular, every $a \in A$ ranks its
neighbors in a strict order of preference, whereas the preference lists of $b
\in B$ may contain ties. A matching $M$ is popular if there is no matching $M'$
such that the number of vertices that prefer $M'$ to $M$ exceeds the number of
vertices that prefer $M$ to~$M'$. We show that the problem of deciding whether
$G$ admits a popular matching or not is NP-hard. This is the case even when
every $b \in B$ either has a strict preference list or puts all its neighbors
into a single tie. In contrast, we show that the problem becomes polynomially
solvable in the case when each $b \in B$ puts all its neighbors into a single
tie. That is, all neighbors of $b$ are tied in $b$'s list and $b$ desires to be
matched to any of them. Our main result is an $O(n^2)$ algorithm (where $n = |A
\cup B|$) for the popular matching problem in this model. Note that this model
is quite different from the model where vertices in $B$ have no preferences and
do not care whether they are matched or not."
"An $n$-bit Gray code is a sequence of all $n$-bit strings such that
consecutive strings differ in a single bit. It is well-known that given
$\alpha,\beta\in\{0,1\}^n$, an $n$-bit Gray code between $\alpha$ and $\beta$
exists iff the Hamming distance $d(\alpha,\beta)$ of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is
odd. We generalize this classical result to $k$ pairwise disjoint pairs
$\alpha_i, \beta_i\in\{0,1\}^n$: if $d(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ is odd for all $i$
and $k<n$, then the set of all $n$-bit strings can be partitioned into $k$
sequences such that the $i$-th sequence leads from $\alpha_i$ to $\beta_i$ and
consecutive strings differ in a single bit. This holds for every $n>1$ with one
exception in the case when $n = k + 1 = 4$. Our result is optimal in the sense
that for every $n>2$ there are $n$ pairwise disjoint pairs
$\alpha_i,\beta_i\in\{0,1\}^n$ with $d(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ odd for which such
sequences do not exist."
"We define and study a class of graphs, called 2-stab interval graphs (2SIG),
with boxicity 2 which properly contains the class of interval graphs. A 2SIG is
an axes-parallel rectangle intersection graph where the rectangles have unit
height (that is, length of the side parallel to $Y$-axis) and intersects either
of the two fixed lines, parallel to the $X$-axis, distance $1+\epsilon$ ($0 <
\epsilon < 1$) apart. Intuitively, 2SIG is a graph obtained by putting some
edges between two interval graphs in a particular rule. It turns out that for
these kind of graphs, the chromatic number of any of its induced subgraphs is
bounded by twice of its (induced subgraph) clique number. This shows that the
graph, even though not perfect, is not very far from it. Then we prove similar
results for some subclasses of 2SIG and provide efficient algorithm for finding
their clique number. We provide a matrix characterization for a subclass of
2SIG graph."
"The paper is divided in to two parts. In the first part we present some new
results for the \textit{routing via matching} model introduced by Alon et
al\cite{5}. This model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed
network. The nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where
a node exchanges data with its partner. Formally, given a connected graph $G$
with vertices labeled from $[1,...,n]$ and a permutation $\pi$ giving the
destination of pebbles on the vertices the problem is to find a minimum step
routing scheme. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given
$\pi$. In this paper we present the following new results, which answer one of
the open problems posed in \cite{5}: 1) Determining whether $rt(G,\pi)$ is $\le
2$ can be done in $O(n^{2.5})$ deterministic time for any arbitrary connected
graph $G$. 2) Determining whether $rt(G,\pi)$ is $\le k$ for any $k \ge 3$ is
NP-Complete. In the second part we study a related property of graphs, which
measures how easy it is to design sorting networks using only the edges of a
given graph. Informally, \textit{sorting number} of a graph is the minimum
depth sorting network that only uses edges of the graph. Many of the classical
results on sorting networks can be represented in this framework. We show that
a tree with maximum degree $\Delta$ can accommodate a $O(\min(n\Delta^2,n^2))$
depth sorting network. Additionally, we give two instance of trees for which
this bound is tight."
"There has been intensive work on the parameterized complexity of the
typically NP-hard task to edit undirected graphs into graphs fulfilling certain
given vertex degree constraints. In this work, we lift the investigations to
the case of directed graphs; herein, we focus on arc insertions. To this end,
our general two-stage framework consists of efficiently solving a
problem-specific number problem transferring its solution to a solution for the
graph problem by applying flow computations. In this way, we obtain
fixed-parameter tractability and polynomial kernelizability results, with the
central parameter being the maximum vertex in- or outdegree of the output
digraph. Although there are certain similarities with the much better studied
undirected case, the flow computation used in the directed case seems not to
work for the undirected case while f-factor computations as used in the
undirected case seem not to work for the directed case."
"We consider an asynchronous voting process on graphs which we call discordant
voting, and which can be described as follows. Initially each vertex holds one
of two opinions, red or blue say. Neighbouring vertices with different opinions
interact pairwise. After an interaction both vertices have the same colour. The
quantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of
interactions needed for all vertices have the same colour.
  An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and
the other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is
incident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are
based on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are
several ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. Push: Pick a
random discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour.
Pull: Pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random
discordant neighbour. Oblivious: Pick a random endpoint of a random discordant
edge and push the colour to the other end point.
  We show that E(T), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on
the underlying graph and the update rule. For connected graphs on n vertices,
and an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. For oblivious
voting, E(T) =n^2/4 independent of the underlying graph. For the complete graph
K_n, the push protocol has E(T)= Theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has
E(T)= Theta(2^n). For the cycle C_n all three protocols have E(T) = Theta(n^2).
For the star graph however, the pull protocol has E(T)=O(n^2), whereas the push
protocol is slower with E(T) = Theta(n^2 log(n)).
  The wide variation in E(T) for the pull protocol is to be contrasted with the
well known model of synchronous pull voting, for which E(T) = O(n) on many
classes of expanders."
"Here we show that by expressing a van der Waerden number $W(r, k)$ by its
radix polynomial representation, it not only is possible to locate each proper
subset on $\mathbb{R}$ in which the van der Waerden number lies, but also to
show that conditions exist for which the logarithm of the van der Waerden
number necessarily is bounded above by the square of the number of terms $k$ in
the arithmetic progression. Furthermore we also use the method to find a
mathematical expression or formula for the ratio of two ""consecutive"" van der
Waerden numbers of the kind $W(r, k)$, $W(r, k + 1)$."
"Let $\mathcal{G}_{m,\sigma}$ be the collection of all weighted bipartite
graphs each having $\sigma$ and $m$, as the size of a vertex partition and the
total weight, respectively. We give a tight lower bound $\lceil
\frac{m-\sigma}{\sigma} \rceil+1$ for the set
$\{\textit{Wt}(\textit{mwm}(G))~|~G \in \mathcal{G}_{m,\sigma}\}$ which denotes
the collection of weights of maximum weight bipartite matchings of all graphs
in $\mathcal{G}_{m,\sigma}$."
"Let I be an independent set of a graph G. Imagine that a token is located on
any vertex of I. We can now move the tokens of I along the edges of the graph
as long as the set of tokens still defines an independent set of G. Given two
independent sets I and J, the Token Sliding problem consists in deciding
whether there exists a sequence of independent sets which transforms I into J
so that every pair of consecutive independent sets of the sequence can be
obtained via a token move. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even on
planar graphs.
  In 2014, Demaine et al. asked whether the Token Sliding reconfiguration
problem is polynomial time solvable on interval graphs and more generally in
chordal graphs. Yamada and Uehara showed in 2016 that a polynomial time
transformation can be found in proper interval graphs.
  In this paper, we answer the first question of Demaine et al. and generalize
the result of Yamada and Uehara by showing that we can decide in polynomial
time whether two independent sets of an interval graph are in the same
connected component. Moveover, we answer similar questions by showing that: (i)
determining if there exists a token sliding transformation between every pair
of k-independent sets in an interval graph can be decided in polynomial time;
(ii) deciding this problem becomes co-NP-hard and even co-W[2]-hard
(parameterized by the size of the independent set) on split graphs, a sub-class
of chordal graphs."
"The theory of combinatorial designs has recently been used in order to build
switch-centric data centre networks incorporating a large number of servers, in
comparison with the popular Fat-Tree data centre network. The construction
employed, called the 3-step method, revolves around an appropriately chosen
(but relatively small) bipartite graph and a transversal design. In this paper,
we clarify and extend these recent results. In particular, we prove the
following path diversity results: in a one-to-one context, we prove that in
these data centre networks there are pairwise link-disjoint paths joining all
the servers adjacent to some switch with all the servers adjacent to any other
switch so that we retain control of the path lengths (these results are optimal
in terms of the numbers of paths constructed and we prove that we have a wide
choice of bipartite graph and transversal design to which we can apply the
3-step method); and in a one-to-many context, we prove that there are pairwise
link-disjoint paths from all the servers adjacent to some switch to any
identically-sized collection of target servers where these target servers need
not be adjacent to the same switch (again, we keep control of the path
lengths). Our constructions and analysis are undertaken on bipartite graphs
with the applications to data centre networks being easily derived. Our results
strengthen the overall competitiveness of data centre networks constructed
using the 3-step method, in comparison with Fat-Tree data centre networks, and,
more generally, show the potential of results and methodologies from
combinatorics to data centre network design."
"The satisfiability problem is known to be $\mathbf{NP}$-complete in general
and for many restricted cases. One way to restrict instances of $k$-SAT is to
limit the number of times a variable can occur. It was shown that for an
instance of 4-SAT with the property that every literal appears in exactly 4
clauses (2 times negated and 2 times not negated), determining whether there is
an assignment for literals, such that every clause contains exactly 2 true
literals and 2 false literals is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete. In this work, we show
that deciding the satisfiability of 3-SAT with the property that every literal
appears in exactly 4 clauses (2 time negated and 2 times not negated), is $
\mathbf{NP} $-complete. We call this problem $(2/2/3)$-SAT. For a nonempty
regular graph $G = (V,E)$, it was asked by \cite{dehhh} to determine whether
for a given independent set $T $, there is an independent dominating set $D$
for $T$ such that $ T \cap D =\varnothing $? As an application of $(2/2/3)$-SAT
problem, we show that for every $r\geq 3$, this problem is $ \mathbf{NP}
$-complete. It is well-known that the vertex set of every graph without
isolated vertices can be partitioned into two dominating sets \cite{ID3}.
Determining the computational complexity of deciding whether the vertices of a
given connected cubic graph $G$ can be partitioned into independent dominating
sets remains unsolved. We show that this problem is $ \mathbf{NP} $-complete,
even if restricted to (i) connected graphs with only two numbers in their
degree sets, (ii) cubic graphs. Finally, we study the relationship between
1-perfect codes and the incidence coloring of graphs and as another application
of our complexity results, we prove that for a given cubic graph $G$ deciding
whether $G$ is 4-incidence colorable is $ \mathbf{NP} $-complete."
"The celebrated Cheeger's Inequality establishes a bound on the edge expansion
of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral
theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open
to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used
to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.
  In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing
the Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a
diffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure
flows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum.
Since the operator is non-linear, we have to exploit other properties of the
diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning the ""second
eigenvalue"" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that higher order
spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework.
  We consider a stochastic diffusion process, in which each vertex also
experiences Brownian noise from outside the system. We show a relationship
between the second eigenvalue and the convergence behavior of the process.
  We show that various hypergraph parameters like multi-way expansion and
diameter can be bounded using this operator's spectral properties. Since higher
order spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead
use the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher order Cheeger-like
inequalities. For any positive integer $k$, we give a polynomial time algorithm
to compute an $O(\log r)$-approximation to the $k$-th procedural minimizer,
where $r$ is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this
approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis for constant values of
$k$."
"It is known that there are no more Lyndon words of length n than there are
periodic necklaces of same length. This paper considers a similar problem
where, additionally, the necklaces must be without some forbidden factors. This
problem relates to a different context, concerned with the behaviours of
particular discrete dynamical systems, namely, Boolean automata networks. A
formal argument supporting the following idea is provided: addition of cycle
intersections in network structures causes exponential reduction of the
networks' number of attractors."
"Path-addition is an operation that takes a graph and adds an internally
vertex-disjoint path between two vertices together with a set of supplementary
edges. Path-additions are just the opposite of taking minors.
  We show that some classes of graphs are closed under path-addition, including
non-planar, right angle crossing, fan-crossing free, quasi-planar, (aligned)
bar 1-visibility, and interval graphs, whereas others are not closed, including
all subclasses of planar graphs, bounded treewidth, k-planar, fan-planar,
outer-fan planar, outer-fan-crossing free, and bar (1,j)-visibility graphs."
"The topic of the article is the parametric study of the complexity of
algorithms on arrays of pairwise distinct integers. We introduce a model that
takes into account the non-uniformness of data, which we call the Ewens-like
distribution of parameter $\theta$ for records on permutations: the weight
$\theta^r$ of a permutation depends on its number $r$ of records. We show that
this model is meaningful for the notion of presortedness, while still being
mathematically tractable. Our results describe the expected value of several
classical permutation statistics in this model, and give the expected running
time of three algorithms: the Insertion Sort, and two variants of the Min-Max
search."
"We consider two variants of the classical Stable Roommates problem with
Incomplete (but strictly ordered) preference lists SRI that are degree
constrained, i.e., preference lists are of bounded length. The first variant,
EGAL d-SRI, involves finding an egalitarian stable matching in solvable
instances of SRI with preference lists of length at most d. We show that this
problem is NP-hard even if d=3. On the positive side we give a
(2d+3)/7-approximation algorithm for d={3,4,5} which improves on the known
bound of 2 for the unbounded preference list case. In the second variant of
SRI, called d-SRTI, preference lists can include ties and are of length at most
d. We show that the problem of deciding whether an instance of d-SRTI admits a
stable matching is NP-complete even if d=3. We also consider the ""most stable""
version of this problem and prove a strong inapproximability bound for the d=3
case. However for d=2 we show that the latter problem can be solved in
polynomial time."
"The Shortest Superstring Problem (SSP) consists, for a set of strings S =
{s_1,...,s_n}, to find a minimum length string that contains all s_i, 1 <= i <=
k, as substrings. This problem is proved to be NP-Complete and APX-hard.
Guaranteed approximation algorithms have been proposed, the current best ratio
being 2+11/23, which has been achieved following a long and difficult quest.
However, SSP is highly used in practice on next generation sequencing (NGS)
data, which plays an increasingly important role in sequencing. In this note,
we show that the SSP approximation ratio can be improved on NGS reads by
assuming specific characteristics of NGS data that are experimentally verified
on a very large sampling set."
"The AHP/ANP are multicriteria decision-making theories that deal with both
hierarchic structures when the criteria are independent of the alternatives and
with networks when there is any dependence within and between elements of the
decision. Both of them have been repeatedly used in practice by various
researchers and practitioners. From the perspective of almost 40 years of
practice in solving problems using both theories, some of their properties seem
to be more important than others. The article indicates four of them as
fundamental for understanding AHP/ANP. These are the axioms related to
structure, computation, and expectation. The mathematical formulation of the
axioms is preceded by an introduction explaining the motivation behind the
introduced concepts. The article is expository and it is an improved and
refined version of the work [1]."
"In graph theory a partition of the vertex set of a graph is called equitable
if for all pairs of cells all vertices in one cell have an equal number of
neighbours in the other cell. Considering the implications for the adjacency
matrix one may generalize that concept as a block partition of a complex square
matrix s.t. each block has constant row sum. It is well known that replacing
each block by its row sum yields a smaller matrix whose multiset of eigenvalues
is contained in the initial spectrum. We generalize this approach to weighted
row sums and rectangular matrices and derive an efficient unitary
transformation which approximately block triangularizes a matrix w.r.t. an
arbitrary partition. Singular values and Hermiticity (if present) are
preserved. The approximation is exact in the equitable case and the error can
be bounded in terms of unitarily invariant matrix norms."
"Let $G$ be an undirected bipartite graph with positive integer weights on the
edges. We refine the existing decomposition theorem originally proposed by Kao
et al., for computing maximum weight bipartite matching. We apply it to design
an efficient version of the decomposition algorithm to compute the weight of a
maximum weight bipartite matching of $G$ in $O(\sqrt{|V|}W'/k(|V|,W'/N))$-time
by employing an algorithm designed by Feder and Motwani as a subroutine, where
$|V|$ and $N$ denote the number of nodes and the maximum edge weight of $G$,
respectively and $k(x,y)=\log x /\log(x^2/y)$. The parameter $W'$ is smaller
than the total edge weight $W,$ essentially when the largest edge weight
differs by more than one from the second largest edge weight in the current
working graph in any decomposition step of the algorithm. In best case
$W'=O(|E|)$ where $|E|$ be the number of edges of $G$ and in worst case $W'=W,$
that is, $|E| \leq W' \leq W.$ In addition, we talk about a scaling property of
the algorithm and research a better bound of the parameter $W'$. An
experimental evaluation on randomly generated data shows that the proposed
improvement is significant in general."
"A simple-triangle graph (also known as a PI graph) is the intersection graph
of a family of triangles defined by a point on a horizontal line and an
interval on another horizontal line. The recognition problem for
simple-triangle graphs was a longstanding open problem, and recently a
polynomial-time algorithm has been given [G. B. Mertzios, The Recognition of
Simple-Triangle Graphs and of Linear-Interval Orders is Polynomial, SIAM J.
Discrete Math., 29(3):1150--1185, 2015]. Along with the approach of this paper,
we show a simpler recognition algorithm for simple-triangle graphs. To do this,
we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the following problem: Given a
bipartite graph $G$ and a set $F$ of edges of $G$, find a 2-chain subgraph
cover of $G$ such that one of two chain subgraphs has no edges in $F$."
"A famous conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as and Sumner states for any tree $T$ and
integer $k$, if the chromatic number of a graph is large enough, either the
graph contains a clique of size $k$ or it contains $T$ as an induced subgraph.
We discuss some results and open problems about extensions of this conjecture
to oriented graphs. We conjecture that for every oriented star $S$ and integer
$k$, if the chromatic number of a digraph is large enough, either the digraph
contains a clique of size $k$ or it contains $S$ as an induced subgraph. As an
evidence, we prove that for any oriented star $S$, every oriented graph with
sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a transitive tournament of
order $3$ or $S$ as an induced subdigraph. We then study for which sets ${\cal
P}$ of orientations of $P_4$ (the path on four vertices) similar statements
hold. We establish some positive and negative results."
"In this paper, we focus on a generalised version of Gabriel graphs known as
Locally Gabriel graphs ($LGGs$) and Unit distance graphs ($UDGs$) on convexly
independent point sets. $UDGs$ are sub graphs of $LGGs$. We give a simpler
proof for the claim that $LGGs$ on convex independent point sets have $2n \log
n + O(n)$ edges. Then we prove that unit distance graphs on convex independent
point sets have $O(n)$ edges improving the previous known bound of $O(n \log
n)$."
"The Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property relates parameters of covering and packing of
combinatorial structures and has been mostly studied in the setting of
undirected graphs. In this note, we use results of Chudnovsky, Fradkin, Kim,
and Seymour to show that, for every directed graph $H$ (resp.
strongly-connected directed graph $H$), the class of directed graphs that
contain $H$ as a strong minor (resp. butterfly minor, topological minor) has
the vertex-Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property in the class of tournaments. We also prove
that if $H$ is a strongly-connected directed graph, the class of directed
graphs containing $H$ as an immersion has the edge-Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property in
the class of tournaments. Our results are orthogonal to the recent results of
Amiri et al. [arXiv:1603.02504, March 2016] in the sense that we restrict the
class of ""host graphs"", whereas they restrict the class of ""guest graphs""."
"Pull voting is a classic method to reach consensus among $n$ vertices with
differing opinions in a distributed network: each vertex at each step takes on
the opinion of a random neighbour. This method, however, suffers from two
drawbacks. Even if there are only two opposing opinions, the time taken for a
single opinion to emerge can be slow and the final opinion is not necessarily
the initially held majority.
  We refer to a protocol where 2 neighbours are contacted at each step as a
2-sample voting protocol. In the two-sample protocol a vertex updates its
opinion only if both sampled opinions are the same. Not much was known about
the performance of two-sample voting on general expanders in the case of three
or more opinions. In this paper we show that the following performance can be
achieved on a $d$-regular expander using two-sample voting. We suppose there
are $k \ge 3$ opinions, and that the initial size of the largest and second
largest opinions is $A_1, A_2$ respectively.
  We prove that, if $A_1 - A_2 \ge C n \max\{\sqrt{(\log n)/A_1}, \lambda\}$,
where $\lambda$ is the absolute second eigenvalue of matrix $P=Adj(G)/d$ and
$C$ is a suitable constant, then the largest opinion wins in $O((n \log
n)/A_1)$ steps with high probability.
  For almost all $d$-regular graphs, we have $\lambda=c/\sqrt{d}$ for some
constant $c>0$. This means that as $d$ increases we can separate an opinion
whose majority is $o(n)$, whereas $\Theta(n)$ majority is required for $d$
constant.
  This work generalizes the results of Becchetti et. al (SPAA 2014) for the
complete graph $K_n$."
"A neighborhood for d-dimensional cellular automata is introduced that spans
the range from von Neumann to Moore neighborhood using a parameter which
represents the dimension of hypercubes connecting neighboring cells. The
neighborhood is extended to include a concept of radius. The number of
neighbors is calculated. For diamond-shaped neighborhoods, a sequence is
obtained whose partial sums equal Delannoy numbers."
"Strictly Chordality-k graphs (SCk graphs) are graphs which are either cycle
free or every induced cycle is exactly k, for some fixed k, k \geq 3. Note that
k = 3 and k = 4 are precisely the Chordal graphs and Chordal Bipartite graphs,
respectively. In this paper, we initiate a structural and an algorithmic study
of SCk, k \geq 5 graphs."
"Coding schemes with extremely low computational complexity are required for
particular applications, such as wireless body area networks, in which case
both very high data accuracy and very low power-consumption are required
features. In this paper, coding schemes arising from incidence matrices of
graphs are proposed. An analysis of the resilience of such codes to erasures is
given using graph theoretical arguments; decodability of a graph is
characterized in terms of the rank of its incidence matrix. Bounds are given on
the number of decodable subgraphs of a graph and the number of edges that must
be deleted in order to arrive at an undecodable subgraph. Algorithms to
construct codes that are optimal with respect to these bounds are presented."
"A set $D\subseteq V$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is called a restrained dominating
set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$ and to a
vertex in $V \setminus D$. The \textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem
is to find a restrained dominating set of minimum cardinality. Given a graph
$G$, and a positive integer $k$, the \textsc{Restrained Domination Decision}
problem is to decide whether $G$ has a restrained dominating set of cardinality
a most $k$. The \textsc{Restrained Domination Decision} problem is known to be
NP-complete for chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this
NP-completeness result by showing that the \textsc{Restrained Domination
Decision} problem remains NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of
chordal graphs. We also propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve the
\textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem in block graphs, a subclass of
doubly chordal graphs. The \textsc{Restrained Domination Decision} problem is
also known to be NP-complete for split graphs. We propose a polynomial time
algorithm to compute a minimum restrained dominating set of threshold graphs, a
subclass of split graphs. In addition, we also propose polynomial time
algorithms to solve the \textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem in
cographs and chain graphs. Finally, we give a new improved upper bound on the
restrained domination number, cardinality of a minimum restrained dominating
set in terms of number of vertices and minimum degree of graph. We also give a
randomized algorithm to find a restrained dominating set whose cardinality
satisfy our upper bound with a positive probability."
"The F-index of a graph $G$ is the sum of the cubes of the degrees of the
vertices of $G$. In this paper, explicit expressions for the F-index of
different transformation graphs of type ${{G}^{xyz}}$ with $x, y, z\in \{-, +
\}$ are obtained. F-index for semitotal point graph and semitotal line graph
are also obtained here."
"The present paper contains additional asymptotic result over an earlier
investigation of Kapelko and Kranakis.
  Consider $n$ mobile sensors placed independently at random with the uniform
distribution on the unit interval $[0,1]$. Fix $a$ an odd natural number. Let
$X_i$ be the the $i-$th closest sensor to $0$ on the interval $[0,1].$ Then the
following identity holds
$$\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbf{E}\left[\left|X_i-\left(\frac{i}{n}-\frac{1}{2n}\right)\right|^a\right]=\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{a}{2}+1\right)}{2^{\frac{a}{2}}(1+a)}\frac{1}{n^{\frac{a}{2}-1}}+O\left(\frac{1}{n^{\frac{a-1}{2}}}\right),$$
when $a$ is an odd natural number, where $\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function."
"Random Edge is the most natural randomized pivot rule for the simplex
algorithm. Considerable progress has been made recently towards fully
understanding its behavior. Back in 2001, Welzl introduced the concepts of
\emph{reachmaps} and \emph{niceness} of Unique Sink Orientations (USO), in an
effort to better understand the behavior of Random Edge. In this paper, we
initiate the systematic study of these concepts. We settle the questions that
were asked by Welzl about the niceness of (acyclic) USO. Niceness implies
natural upper bounds for Random Edge and we provide evidence that these are
tight or almost tight in many interesting cases. Moreover, we show that Random
Edge is polynomial on at least $n^{\Omega(2^n)}$ many (possibly cyclic) USO. As
a bonus, we describe a derandomization of Random Edge which achieves the same
asymptotic upper bounds with respect to niceness and discuss some algorithmic
properties of the reachmap."
"With the objective of employing graphs toward a more generalized theory of
signal processing, we present a novel sampling framework for (wavelet-)sparse
signals defined on circulant graphs which extends basic properties of Finite
Rate of Innovation (FRI) theory to the graph domain, and can be applied to
arbitrary graphs via suitable approximation schemes. At its core, the
introduced Graph-FRI-framework states that any K-sparse signal on the vertices
of a circulant graph can be perfectly reconstructed from its
dimensionality-reduced representation in the Graph Fourier domain of minimum
size 2K. By leveraging the recently developed theory of e-splines and e-spline
wavelets on graphs, one can decompose this graph spectral transformation into
the multiresolution low-pass filtering operation with a graph e-spline filter,
and subsequent transformation to the spectral graph domain; this allows to
infer a distinct sampling pattern, and, ultimately, the structure of an
associated coarsened graph, which preserves essential properties of the
original, including circularity and, where applicable, the graph generating
set."
"Let o be a 4k-length column vector whose all entries are 1s, with k a
positive integer. Let V={v_i} be a set of semi-normalized Hadamard
(SH)-vectors, which are 4k-length vectors whose 2k entries are -1s and the
remaining 2k are 1s. We define a 4k-order QSH (Quasi SH)-matrix, Q, as a 4kx4k
matrix where the first column is o and the remaining ones are distinct v_i in
V. When Q is orthogonal, it becomes an SH-matrix H. Therefore, 4k-order
SH-matrices can be built by enumerate all possible Q from every combination of
v_i, then evaluate the orthogonality of each one of them. Since such exhaustive
method requires a large amount of computing resource, we can employ
probabilistic algorithms to construct H, such as, by Random Vector Selection
(RVS) or the Orthogonalization by Simulated Annealing (OSA) algorithms. We
demonstrate the constructions of low-order SH-matrices by using these methods.
We also analyze some probabilistic aspects of the constructions, including
orthogonal probability p between a pair of randomly selected SH-vectors, the
existence probability p_H|Q that a randomly generated Q is in fact an SH-matrix
H, and address the discrepancy of the distribution between the known number of
SH-matrix with expected number derived from the probabilistic analysis."
"In this paper, we construct a weakly universal cellular automaton in the
heptagrid, the tessellation $\{7,3\}$ which is not rotation invariant but which
is truly planar. This result, under these conditions, cannot be improved for
the tessellations $\{p,3\}$."
"Starting with the recursive extended Euclid's algorithm, we apply a
systematic approach using matrix notation to transform it into an iterative
algorithm. The partial correctness proof derived from the transformation turns
out to be very elegant, and easy to follow. The paper provides a connection
between recursive and iterative versions of extended Euclid's algorithm."
"This short paper gives a detailed proof of identity between two classic
formulas for the computation of the exact Miss Rate of LRU caches. An extension
to the identity of two formulas of the expected time of a partial collection in
the coupon collector problem is also presented."
"We define a \emph{thermal network}, which is a network where the flow
functionality of a node depends upon its temperature. This model is inspired by
several types of real-life networks, and generalizes some conventional network
models wherein nodes have fixed capacities and the problem is to maximize the
flow through the network. In a thermal network, the temperature of a node
increases as traffic moves through it, and nodes may also cool spontaneously
over time, or by employing cooling packets. We analyze the problems of
maximizing the flow from a source to a sink for both these cases, for a
holistic view with respect to the single-source-single-sink dynamic flow
problem in a thermal network. We have studied certain properties such a thermal
network exhibits, and give closed-form solutions for the maximum flow that can
be achieved through such a network."
"An identifying code in a graph is a subset of vertices having a nonempty and
distinct intersection with the closed neighborhood of every vertex. We prove
that the infimum density of any identifying code in $S_k$ (an infinite strip of
$k$ rows in the square grid) can always be achieved by a periodic identifying
code with pattern length at most $2^{4k}$. Assisted by a compute program
implementing Karp's algorithm for minimum cycle mean, we find a periodic
identifying code in $S_4$ with the minimum density $11/28$, and a periodic
identifying code in $S_5$ with the minimum density $19/50$."
"A spanning tree of a graph $G$ is a connected acyclic spanning subgraph of
$G$. We consider enumeration of spanning trees when $G$ is a $2$-tree, meaning
that $G$ is obtained from one edge by iteratively adding a vertex whose
neighborhood consists of two adjacent vertices. We use this construction order
both to inductively list the spanning trees without repetition and to give
bounds on the number of them. We determine the $n$-vertex $2$-trees having the
most and the fewest spanning trees. The $2$-tree with the fewest is unique; it
has $n-2$ vertices of degree $2$ and has $n2^{n-3}$ spanning trees. Those with
the most are all those having exactly two vertices of degree $2$, and their
number of spanning trees is the Fibonacci number $F_{2n-2}$."
"We study shared multi-processor scheduling problem where each job can be
executed on its private processor and simultaneously on one of many processors
shared by all jobs in order to reduce the job's completion time due to
processing time overlap. The total weighted overlap of all jobs is to be
maximized. The problem models subcontracting scheduling in supply chains and
divisible load scheduling in computing. We show that synchronized schedules
that complete each job at the same time on its private processor and shared
processors, if any is actually used by the job, include optimal schedules. We
prove that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense for jobs with arbitrary
weights, and we give an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm for the problem
with equal weights."
"In this paper we consider a variation of a recoloring problem, called the
Color-Fixing. Let us have some non-proper $r$-coloring $\varphi$ of a graph
$G$. We investigate the problem of finding a proper $r$-coloring of $G$, which
is ""the most similar"" to $\varphi$, i.e. the number $k$ of vertices that have
to be recolored is minimum possible. We observe that the problem is NP-complete
for any $r \geq 3$, even for bipartite planar graphs. On the other hand, the
problem is fixed-parameter tractable, when parameterized by the number of
allowed transformations $k$. We provide an $2^n \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$
algorithm for the problem (for any fixed $r$) and a linear algorithm for graphs
with bounded treewidth. We also show several lower complexity bounds, using
standard complexity assumptions. Finally, we investigate the {\em fixing
number} of a graph $G$. It is the maximum possible distance (in the number of
transformations) between some non-proper coloring of $G$ and a proper one."
"Given a graph G = (V,E) with a root r in V, positive capacities {c(e)|e in
E}, and non-negative lengths {l(e)|e in E}, the minimum-length (rooted) edge
capacitated Steiner tree problem is to find a tree in G of minimum total
length, rooted at r, spanning a given subset T of vertices, and such that, for
each e in E, there are at most c(e) paths, linking r to vertices in T, that
contain e. We study the complexity and approximability of the problem,
considering several relevant parameters such as the number of terminals, the
edge lengths and the minimum and maximum edge capacities. For all but one
combinations of assumptions regarding these parameters, we settle the question,
giving a complete characterization that separates tractable cases from hard
ones. The only remaining open case is proved to be equivalent to a
long-standing open problem. We also prove close relations between our problem
and classical Steiner tree as well as vertex-disjoint paths problems."
"mim-width is a recent graph width measure that has seen applications in graph
algorithms and problems related to propositional satisfiability. In this paper,
we show linear lower bounds for the mim-width of strongly chordal split graphs,
co-comparability graphs and circle graphs. This improves and refines lower
bounds that were known before, some of them only conditionally. In the case of
strongly chordal graphs not even a conditional lower bound was known before.
All of the bounds given are optimal up to constants."
"Derandomization of Chernoff bound with union bound is already proven in many
papers. We here give another explicit version of it that obtains a construction
of size that is arbitrary close to the probabilistic nonconstructive size.
  We apply this to give a new simple polynomial time constructions of almost
$k$-wise independent sets. We also give almost tight lower bounds for the size
of $k$-wise independent sets."
"Inspired by the artwork of Mark Lombardi, we study the problem of
constructing orthogonal drawings where a small number of horizontal and
vertical line segments covers all vertices. We study two problems on orthogonal
drawings of planar graphs, one that minimizes the total number of line segments
and another that minimizes the number of line segments that cover all the
vertices. We show that the first problem can be solved by a non-trivial
modification of the flow-network orthogonal bend-minimization algorithm of
Tamassia, resulting in a polynomial-time algorithm. We show that the second
problem is NP-hard even for planar graphs with maximum degree 3. Given this
result, we then address this second optimization problem for trees and
series-parallel graphs with maximum degree 3. For both graph classes, we give
polynomial-time algorithms for upward orthogonal drawings with the minimum
number of segments covering the vertices."
"Given a set of $n$ elements separated by a pairwise distance matrix, the
minimum differential dispersion problem (Min-Diff DP) aims to identify a subset
of m elements (m < n) such that the difference between the maximum sum and the
minimum sum of the inter-element distances between any two chosen elements is
minimized. We propose an effective iterated local search (denoted by
ILS_MinDiff) for Min-Diff DP. To ensure an effective exploration and
exploitation of the search space, the proposed ILS_MinDiff algorithm iterates
through three sequential search phases: a fast descent-based neighborhood
search phase to find a local optimum from a given starting solution, a local
optima exploring phase to visit nearby high-quality solutions around a given
local optimum, and a local optima escaping phase to move away from the current
search region. Experimental results on six data sets of 190 benchmark instances
demonstrate that ILS_MinDiff competes favorably with the state-of-the-art
algorithms by finding 130 improved best results (new upper bounds)."
"The Narumi-Katayama index of a graph was introduced in 1984 for representing
the carbon skeleton of a saturated hydrocarbons and is defined as the product
of degrees of all the vertices of the graph. In this paper, we examine the
Narumi-Katayama index of different total transformation graphs."
"A distinguishing $r$-labeling of a digraph $G$ is a mapping $\lambda$ from
the set of verticesof $G$ to the set of labels $\{1,\dots,r\}$ such that no
nontrivial automorphism of $G$ preserves all the labels.The distinguishing
number $D(G)$ of $G$ is then the smallest $r$ for which $G$ admits a
distinguishing $r$-labeling.From a result of Gluck (David Gluck, Trivial
set-stabilizers in finite permutation groups,{\em Can. J. Math.} 35(1) (1983),
59--67),it follows that $D(T)=2$ for every cyclic tournament~$T$ of (odd) order
$2p+1\ge 3$.Let $V(T)=\{0,\dots,2p\}$ for every such tournament.Albertson and
Collins conjectured in 1999that the canonical 2-labeling $\lambda^*$ given
by$\lambda^*(i)=1$ if and only if $i\le p$ is distinguishing.We prove that
whenever one of the subtournaments of $T$ induced by vertices $\{0,\dots,p\}$or
$\{p+1,\dots,2p\}$ is rigid, $T$ satisfies Albertson-Collins Conjecture.Using
this property, we prove that several classes of cyclic tournaments satisfy
Albertson-Collins Conjecture.Moreover, we also prove that every Paley
tournament satisfies Albertson-Collins Conjecture."
"Chromatic polynomials are important objects in graph theory and statistical
physics, but as a result of computational difficulties, their study is limited
to graphs that are small, highly structured, or very sparse. We have devised
and implemented two algorithms that approximate the coefficients of the
chromatic polynomial $P(G,x)$, where $P(G,k)$ is the number of proper
$k$-colorings of a graph $G$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Our algorithm is based on a
method of Knuth that estimates the order of a search tree. We compare our
results to the true chromatic polynomial in several known cases, and compare
our error with previous approximation algorithms."
"Without further ado, we present the P_3-game. The P_3-game is decidable for
elementary classes of graphs such as paths and cycles. From an algorithmic
point of view, the connected P_3-game is fascinating. We show that the
connected P_3-game is polynomially decidable for classes such as trees, chordal
graphs, ladders, cacti, outerplanar graphs and circular arc graphs."
"Measures of the irregularity of chemical graphs could be helpful for
QSAR/QSPR studies and for the descriptive purposes of biological and chemical
properties, such as melting and boiling points, toxicity and resistance. Here
we consider the following four established irregularity measures: the
irregularity index by Albertson, the total irregularity, the variance of vertex
degrees and the Collatz-Sinogowitz index.
  Through the means of graph structural analysis and derivation, we study the
above-mentioned irregularity measures of several chemical molecular graphs
which frequently appear in chemical, medical and material engineering, as well
as the nanotubes: $TUC_4 C_8(S)$, $TUC_4 C_8(R)$, Zig-Zag $TUHC_{6}$, $TUC_4$,
Armchair $TUVC_{6}$, then dendrimers $T_{k,d}$ and the circumcoronene series of
benzenoid $H_k$. In addition, the irregularities of Mycielski's constructions
of cycle and path graphs are analyzed."
"In this work, we develop a new method for the fast and memory-efficient
computation of Slepian functions on the sphere. Slepian functions, which arise
as the solution of the Slepian concentration problem on the sphere, have
desirable properties for applications where measurements are only avail- able
within a spatially limited region on the sphere and/or a function is required
to be analyzed over the spatially limited region. Slepian functions are
currently not easily computed for large band-limits for an arbitrary spatial
region due to high computational and large memory storage requirements. For the
special case of a polar cap, the symmetry of the region enables the
decomposition of the Slepian concentration problem into smaller sub-problems
and consequently the efficient computation of Slepian functions for large
band-limits. By exploiting the efficient computation of Slepian functions for
the polar cap region on the sphere, we develop a formulation, supported by a
fast algorithm, for the approximate computation of Slepian functions for an
arbitrary spatial region to enable the analysis of mod- ern data-sets that
support large band-limits. For the proposed algorithm, we carry out accuracy
analysis of the approximation, computational complexity analysis and review of
memory storage requirements. We illustrate, through numerical experiments, that
the proposed method enables faster computation, and has smaller storage
requirements, while allowing for sufficiently accurate computation of the
Slepian functions."
"Nowhere dense classes of graphs are very general classes of uniformly sparse
graphs with several seemingly unrelated characterisations. From an algorithmic
perspective, a characterisation of these classes in terms of uniform
quasi-wideness, a concept originating in finite model theory, has proved to be
particularly useful. Uniform quasi-wideness is used in many fpt-algorithms on
nowhere dense classes. However, the existing constructions showing the
equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform quasi-wideness imply a
non-elementary blow up in the parameter dependence of the fpt-algorithms,
making them infeasible in practice.
  As a first main result of this paper, we use tools from logic, in particular
from a subfield of model theory known as stability theory, to establish
polynomial bounds for the equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform
quasi-wideness.
  A powerful method in parameterized complexity theory is to compute a problem
kernel in a pre-computation step, that is, to reduce the input instance in
polynomial time to a sub-instance of size bounded in the parameter only
(independently of the input graph size). Our new tools allow us to obtain for
every fixed value of $r$ a polynomial kernel for the distance-$r$ dominating
set problem on nowhere dense classes of graphs. This result is particularly
interesting, as it implies that for every class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs which
is closed under subgraphs, the distance-$r$ dominating set problem admits a
kernel on $\mathcal{C}$ for every value of $r$ if, and only if, it admits a
polynomial kernel for every value of $r$ (under the standard assumption of
parameterized complexity theory that $\mathrm{FPT} \neq W[2]$)."
"We study dynamic network flows with uncertain input data under a robust
optimization perspective. In the dynamic maximum flow problem, the goal is to
maximize the flow reaching the sink within a given time horizon $T$, while flow
requires a certain travel time to traverse an edge.
  In our setting, we account for uncertain travel times of flow. We investigate
maximum flows over time under the assumption that at most $\Gamma$ travel times
may be prolonged simultaneously due to delay. We develop and study a
mathematical model for this problem. As the dynamic robust flow problem
generalizes the static version, it is NP-hard to compute an optimal flow.
However, our dynamic version is considerably more complex than the static
version. We show that it is NP-hard to verify feasibility of a given candidate
solution. Furthermore, we investigate temporally repeated flows and show that
in contrast to the non-robust case (that is, without uncertainties) they no
longer provide optimal solutions for the robust problem, but rather yield a
worst case optimality gap of at least $T$. We finally show that the optimality
gap is at most $O(\eta k \log T)$, where $\eta$ and $k$ are newly introduced
instance characteristics and provide a matching lower bound instance with
optimality gap $\Omega(\log T)$ and $\eta = k = 1$. The results obtained in
this paper yield a first step towards understanding robust dynamic flow
problems with uncertain travel times."
"Stabilization of graphs has received substantial attention in recent years
due to its connection to game theory. Stable graphs are exactly the graphs
inducing a matching game with non-empty core. They are also the graphs that
induce a network bargaining game with a balanced solution. A graph with
weighted edges is called stable if the maximum weight of an integral matching
equals the cost of a minimum fractional weighted vertex cover. If a graph is
not stable, it can be stabilized in different ways. Recent papers have
considered the deletion or addition of edges and vertices in order to stabilize
a graph. In this work, we focus on a fine-grained stabilization strategy,
namely stabilization of graphs by fractionally increasing edge weights. We show
the following results for stabilization by minimum weight increase in edge
weights (min additive stabilizer): (i) Any approximation algorithm for min
additive stabilizer that achieves a factor of $O(|V|^{1/24-\epsilon})$ for
$\epsilon>0$ would lead to improvements in the approximability of
densest-$k$-subgraph. (ii) Min additive stabilizer has no $o(\log{|V|})$
approximation unless NP=P. Results (i) and (ii) together provide the first
super-constant hardness results for any graph stabilization problem. On the
algorithmic side, we present (iii) an algorithm to solve min additive
stabilizer in factor-critical graphs exactly in poly-time, (iv) an algorithm to
solve min additive stabilizer in arbitrary-graphs exactly in time exponential
in the size of the Tutte set, and (v) a poly-time algorithm with approximation
factor at most $\sqrt{|V|}$ for a super-class of the instances generated in our
hardness proofs."
"A fooling-set matrix has nonzero diagonal, but at least one in every pair of
diagonally opposite entries is 0. Dietzfelbinger et al. '96 proved that the
rank of such a matrix is at least $\sqrt n$. It is known that the bound is
tight (up to a multiplicative constant).
  We ask for the ""typical"" minimum rank of a fooling-set matrix: For a
fooling-set zero-nonzero pattern chosen at random, is the minimum rank of a
matrix with that zero-nonzero pattern over a field $\mathbb F$ closer to its
lower bound $\sqrt{n}$ or to its upper bound $n$? We study random patterns with
a given density $p$, and prove an $\Omega(n)$ bound for the cases when: (a) $p$
tends to $0$ quickly enough, (b) $p$ tends to $0$ slowly, and $|\mathbb
F|=O(1)$, (c) $p\in(0,1]$ is a constant.
  We have to leave open the case when $p\to 0$ slowly and $\mathbb F$ is a
large or infinite field (e.g., $\mathbb F=GF(2^n)$, $F=\mathbb{R}$)."
"To achieve an efficient routing in a wireless sensor network, connected
dominating set (CDS) is used as virtual backbone. A fault-tolerant virtual
backbone can be modeled as a $(k,m)$-CDS. For a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and
two fixed integers $k$ and $m$, a node set $C\subseteq V$ is a $(k,m)$-CDS of
$G$ if every node in $V\setminus C$ has at least $m$ neighbors in $C$, and the
subgraph of $G$ induced by $C$ is $k$-connected. Previous to this work,
approximation algorithms with guaranteed performance ratio in a general graph
were know only for $k\leq 3$. This paper makes a significant progress by
presenting a $(2k-1)\alpha_0$ approximation algorithm for general $k$ and $m$
with $m\geq k$, where $\alpha_0$ is the performance ratio for the minimum CDS
problem. Using currently best known ratio for $\alpha_0$, our algorithm has
performance ratio $O(\ln\Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the
graph."
"Since ordered trees and Dyck paths are equinumerous, so are ordered forests
and grand-Dyck paths that start with an upwards step."
"Simultaneous broadcasting of multiple messages from the same source vertex in
synchronous networks is considered under restrictions that each vertex receives
at most one message in a unit time step, every received message can be sent out
only in the next time step, no message is sent to already informed vertex. The
number of outgoing messages in unrestricted, messages have unit length, and we
assume full-duplex mode. In [9] we developed a concept of level-disjoint
partitions to study simultaneous broadcasting under this model. In this work we
consider the optimal number of level-disjoint partitions. We also provide a
necessary condition in terms of eccentricity and girth on existence of $k$
$v$-rooted level-disjoint partitions of optimal height. In particular, we
provide a structural characterization of graphs admitting two level-disjoint
partitions with the same root."
"A proper circular-arc (PCA) model is a pair ${\cal M} = (C, {\cal A})$ where
$C$ is a circle and $\cal A$ is a family of inclusion-free arcs on $C$ in which
no two arcs of $\cal A$ cover $C$. A PCA model $\cal U$ is a $(c, \ell, d,
d_s)$-CA model when $C$ has circumference $c$, all the arcs in $\cal A$ have
length $\ell$, all the extremes of the arcs in $\cal A$ are at a distance at
least $d$, and all the beginning points of the arcs in $\cal A$ are at a
distance at least $d + d_s$. If $c \leq c'$ and $\ell \leq \ell'$ for every
$(c', \ell', d, d_s)$-CA model, then $\cal U$ is $(d, d_s)$-minimal. In this
article we prove that $c$ and $\ell$ are integer combinations of $d$ and $d_s$
when $\cal U$ is $(d, d_s)$-minimal. As a consequence, we obtain an algorithm
to compute a $(d, d_s)$-minimal model equivalent to an input PCA model $\cal M$
that runs in $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space."
"An upper dominating set in a graph is a minimal (with respect to set
inclusion) dominating set of maximum cardinality. The problem of finding an
upper dominating set is generally NP-hard. We study the complexity of this
problem in classes of graphs defined by finitely many forbidden induced
subgraphs and conjecture that the problem admits a dichotomy in this family,
i.e. it is either NP-hard or polynomial-time solvable for each class in the
family. A helpful tool to study the complexity of an algorithmic problem on
finitely defined classes of graphs is the notion of boundary classes. However,
none of such classes has been identified so far for the upper dominating set
problem. In the present paper, we discover the first boundary class for this
problem and prove the dichotomy for classes defined by a single forbidden
induced subgraph."
"We consider capacitated vertex cover with hard capacity constraints (VC-HC)
on hypergraphs. In this problem we are given a hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ with a
maximum edge size $f$. Each edge is associated with a demand and each vertex is
associated with a weight (cost), a capacity, and an available multiplicity. The
objective is to find a minimum-weight vertex multiset such that the demands of
the edges can be covered by the capacities of the vertices and the multiplicity
of each vertex does not exceed its available multiplicity.
  In this paper we present an $O(f)$ bi-approximation for VC-HC that gives a
trade-off on the number of augmented multiplicity and the cost of the resulting
cover. In particular, we show that, by augmenting the available multiplicity by
a factor of $k \ge 2$, a~cover with a cost ratio of
$\Big(1+\frac{1}{k-1}\Big)(f-1)$ to the optimal cover for the original instance
can be obtained. This improves over a previous result, which has a cost ratio
of $f^2$ via augmenting the available multiplicity by a factor of $f$."
"A set C of vertices of a graph is P_3-convex if every vertex outside C has at
most one neighbor in C. The convex hull \sigma(A) of a set A is the smallest
P_3-convex set that contains A. A set M is convexly independent if for every
vertex x \in M, x \notin \sigma(M-x). We show that the maximal number of
vertices that a convexly independent set in a permutation graph can have, can
be computed in polynomial time."
"The Minimum Sum Coloring Problem (MSCP) is derived from the Graph Coloring
Problem (GCP) by associating a weight to each color. The aim of MSCP is to find
a coloring solution of a graph such that the sum of color weights is minimum.
MSCP has important applications in fields such as scheduling and VLSI design.
We propose in this paper new upper bounds of the chromatic strength, i.e. the
minimum number of colors in an optimal solution of MSCP, based on an
abstraction of all possible colorings of a graph called motif. Experimental
results on standard benchmarks show that our new bounds are significantly
tighter than the previous bounds in general, allowing to reduce substantially
the search space when solving MSCP ."
"Suppose that $D=(V,E)$ is a strongly connected digraph. Let $u,v\in V(D)$.
The maximum distance $md (u,v)$ is defined as
$md(u,v)$=max\{$\overrightarrow{d}(u,v), \overrightarrow{d}(v,u)$\} where
$\overrightarrow{d}(u,v)$ denote the length of a shortest directed $u-v$ path
in $D$. This is a metric. The boundary, contour, eccentric and peripheral sets
of a strong digraph $D$ are defined with respect to this metric. The main aim
of this paper is to identify the above said metrically defined sets of a large
strong digraph $D$ in terms of its prime factor decomposition with respect to
cartesian product."
"When factorizing binary matrices, we often have to make a choice between
using expensive combinatorial methods that retain the discrete nature of the
data and using continuous methods that can be more efficient but destroy the
discrete structure. Alternatively, we can first compute a continuous
factorization and subsequently apply a rounding procedure to obtain a discrete
representation. But what will we gain by rounding? Will this yield lower
reconstruction errors? Is it easy to find a low-rank matrix that rounds to a
given binary matrix? Does it matter which threshold we use for rounding? Does
it matter if we allow for only non-negative factorizations? In this paper, we
approach these and further questions by presenting and studying the concept of
rounding rank. We show that rounding rank is related to linear classification,
dimensionality reduction, and nested matrices. We also report on an extensive
experimental study that compares different algorithms for finding good
factorizations under the rounding rank model."
"In this paper, we present a constructive heuristic algorithm for the
$2$-connected $m$-dominating set problem. It is based on a greedy heuristic in
which a 2-connected subgraph is iteratively extended with suitable open ears.
The growth procedure is an adaptation of the breadth-first-search which
efficiently manages to find open ears. Further, a heuristic function is defined
for selecting the best ear out of a list of candidates. The performance of the
basic approach is improved by adding a correction procedure which removes
unnecessary nodes from a generated solution. Finally, randomization is included
and the method is extended towards the GRASP metaheuristic. In our
computational experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm
to recently published results and show that the method is highly competitive
and especially suitable for dense graphs."
"Approximate random $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is a well studied problem in
computer science and statistical physics. It amounts to constructing a
$k$-colouring of $G$ which is distributed close to {\em Gibbs distribution} in
polynomial time. Here, we deal with the problem when the underlying graph is an
instance of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, where $d$ is a
sufficiently large constant.
  We propose a novel efficient algorithm for approximate random $k$-colouring
$G(n,d/n)$ for any $k\geq (1+\epsilon)d$. To be more specific, with probability
at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ over the input instances $G(n,d/n)$ and for $k\geq
(1+\epsilon)d$, the algorithm returns a $k$-colouring which is distributed
within total variation distance $n^{-\Omega(1)}$ from the Gibbs distribution of
the input graph instance.
  The algorithm we propose is neither a MCMC one nor inspired by the message
passing algorithms proposed by statistical physicists. Roughly the idea is as
follows: Initially we remove sufficiently many edges of the input graph. This
results in a ""simple graph"" which can be $k$-coloured randomly efficiently. The
algorithm colours randomly this simple graph. Then it puts back the removed
edges one by one. Every time a new edge is put back the algorithm updates the
colouring of the graph so that the colouring remains random.
  The performance of the algorithm depends heavily on certain spatial
correlation decay properties of the Gibbs distribution."
"A substring Q of a string S is called a shortest unique substring (SUS) for
interval [s,t] in S, if Q occurs exactly once in S, this occurrence of Q
contains interval [s,t], and every substring of S which contains interval [s,t]
and is shorter than Q occurs at least twice in S. The SUS problem is, given a
string S, to preprocess S so that for any subsequent query interval [s,t] all
the SUSs for interval [s,t] can be answered quickly. When s = t, we call the
SUSs for [s,t] as point SUSs, and when s \leq t, we call the SUSs for [s,t] as
interval SUSs. There exist optimal O(n)-time preprocessing scheme which answers
queries in optimal O(k) time for both point and interval SUSs, where n is the
length of S and k is the number of outputs for a given query. In this paper, we
reveal structural, combinatorial properties underlying the SUS problem: Namely,
we show that the number of intervals in S that correspond to point SUSs for all
query positions in S is less than 1.5n, and show that this is a matching upper
and lower bound. Also, we consider the maximum number of intervals in S that
correspond to interval SUSs for all query intervals in S."
"We study functional clones, which are sets of non-negative pseudo-Boolean
functions (functions $\{0,1\}^k\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$) closed under
(essentially) multiplication, summation and limits. Functional clones naturally
form a lattice under set inclusion and are closely related to counting
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). We identify a sublattice of
interesting functional clones and investigate the relationships and properties
of the functional clones in this sublattice."
"The graph translation operator has been defined with good spectral properties
in mind, and in particular with the end goal of being an isometric operator.
Unfortunately, the resulting definitions do not provide good intuitions on a
vertex-domain interpretation. In this paper, we show that this operator does
have a vertex-domain interpretation as a diffusion operator using a polynomial
approximation. We show that its impulse response exhibit an exponential decay
of the energy way from the impulse, demonstrating localization preservation.
Additionally, we formalize several techniques that can be used to study other
graph signal operators."
"This lecture discusses the mathematical relationship between network
structure and network utilization of transportation network. Network structure
means the graph itself. Network utilization represent the aggregation of
trajectories of agents in using the network graph. I show the similarity and
relationship between the structural pattern of the network and network
utilization."
"In this paper, we investigate the well-studied Hamiltonian cycle problem, and
present an interesting dichotomy result on split graphs. T. Akiyama, T.
Nishizeki, and N. Saito \cite{akiyama} have shown that the Hamiltonian cycle
problem is NP-complete in planar bipartite graph with maximum degree $3$. Using
this reduction, we show that the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete in
split graphs. In particular, we show that the problem is NP-complete in
$K_{1,5}$-free split graphs. Further, we present polynomial-time algorithms for
Hamiltonian cycle in $K_{1,3}$-free and $K_{1,4}$-free split graphs. We believe
that the structural results presented in this paper can be used to show similar
dichotomy result for Hamiltonian path and other variants of Hamiltonian cycle
problem."
"In this study, the explicit expressions for F-index and coindex of derived
graphs such as a line graph, subdivision graph, vertex-semitotal graph,
edge-semitotal graph, total graph and paraline graph (line graph of the
subdivision graph) are obtained."
"A gambler moves between the vertices $1, \ldots, n$ of a graph using the
probability distribution $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}$. Multiple cops pursue the
gambler on the graph, only being able to move between adjacent vertices. We
investigate the expected capture time for the gambler against $k$ cops as a
function of $n$ and $k$ for three versions of the game: (1) known gambler: the
cops know the gambler's distribution (2) unknown gambler: the cops do not know
the gambler's distribution (3) known changing gambler: the gambler's
distribution can change every turn, but the cops know all of the gambler's
distributions from the beginning. We show for $n > k$ that if the cops are
allowed to choose their initial positions before the game starts and before
they know the gambler's distribution(s), and if both the gambler and the cops
play optimally, then the expected capture time is $\Theta(n/k)$ for the known
gambler, the unknown gambler, and the known changing gambler."
"A b-coloring of the vertices of a graph is a proper coloring where each color
class contains a vertex which is adjacent to each other color class. The
b-chromatic number of $G$ is the maximum integer $\chi_b(G)$ for which $G$ has
a b-coloring with $\chi_b(G)$ colors. A graph $G$ is b-continuous if $G$ has a
b-coloring with $k$ colors, for every integer $k$ in the interval
$[\chi(G),\chi_b(G)]$. It is known that not all graphs are b-continuous. Here,
we investigate whether the lexicographic product $G[H]$ of b-continuous graphs
$G$ and $H$ is also b-continuous. Using homomorphisms, we provide a new lower
bound for $\chi_b(G[H])$, namely $\chi_b(G[K_t])$, where $t=\chi_b(H)$, and
prove that if $G[K_\ell]$ is b-continuous for every positive integer $\ell$,
then $G[H]$ admits a b-coloring with $k$ colors, for every $k$ in the interval
$[\chi(G[H]),\chi_b(G[K_t])]$. We also prove that $G[K_\ell]$ is b-continuous,
for every positive integer $\ell$, whenever $G$ is a $P_4$-sparse graph, and we
give further results on the b-spectrum of $G[K_\ell]$, when $G$ is chordal."
"Traditionally, reconfiguration problems ask the question whether a given
solution of an optimization problem can be transformed to a target solution in
a sequence of small steps that preserve feasibility of the intermediate
solutions. In this paper, rather than asking this question from an algorithmic
perspective, we analyze the combinatorial structure behind it. We consider the
problem of reconfiguring one independent set into another, using two different
processes: (1) exchanging exactly $k$ vertices in each step, or (2) removing or
adding one vertex in each step while ensuring the intermediate sets contain at
most $k$ fewer vertices than the initial solution. We are interested in
determining the minimum value of $k$ for which this reconfiguration is
possible, and bound these threshold values in terms of several structural graph
parameters. For hereditary graph classes we identify structures that cause the
reconfiguration threshold to be large."
"Large real-world networks typically follow a power-law degree distribution.
To study such networks, numerous random graph models have been proposed.
However, real-world networks are not drawn at random. Therefore, Brach, Cygan,
{\L}acki, and Sankowski [SODA 2016] introduced two natural deterministic
conditions: (1) a power-law upper bound on the degree distribution (PLB-U) and
(2) power-law neighborhoods, that is, the degree distribution of neighbors of
each vertex is also upper bounded by a power law (PLB-N). They showed that many
real-world networks satisfy both deterministic properties and exploit them to
design faster algorithms for a number of classical graph problems.
  We complement the work of Brach et al. by showing that some well-studied
random graph models exhibit both the mentioned PLB properties and additionally
also a power-law lower bound on the degree distribution (PLB-L). All three
properties hold with high probability for Chung-Lu Random Graphs and Geometric
Inhomogeneous Random Graphs and almost surely for Hyperbolic Random Graphs. As
a consequence, all results of Brach et al. also hold with high probability or
almost surely for those random graph classes.
  In the second part of this work we study three classical NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems on PLB networks. It is known that on
general graphs with maximum degree {\Delta}, a greedy algorithm, which chooses
nodes in the order of their degree, only achieves an {\Omega}(ln
{\Delta})-approximation for Minimum Vertex Cover and Minimum Dominating Set,
and an {\Omega}({\Delta})-approximation for Maximum Independent Set. We prove
that the PLB-U property suffices for the greedy approach to achieve a
constant-factor approximation for all three problems. We also show that all
three combinatorial optimization problems are APX-complete, even if all
PLB-properties hold."
"Clark has defined the notion of $n$-avoidance basis which contains the
avoidable formulas with at most $n$ variables that are closest to be
unavoidable in some sense. The family $C_i$ of circular formulas is such that
$C_1=AA$, $C_2=ABA.BAB$, $C_3=ABCA.BCAB.CABC$ and so on. For every $i\le n$,
the $n$-avoidance basis contains $C_i$. Clark showed that the avoidability
index of every circular formula and of every formula in the $3$-avoidance basis
(and thus of every avoidable formula containing at most 3 variables) is at most
4. We determine exactly the avoidability index of these formulas."
"Let G denote a graph and let K be a subset of vertices that are a set of
target vertices of G. The K-terminal reliability of G is defined as the
probability that all target vertices in K are connected, considering the
possible failures of non-target vertices of G. The problem of computing
K-terminal reliability is known to be #P-complete for polygon-circle graphs,
and can be solved in polynomial-time for t-polygon graphs, which are a subclass
of polygon-circle graphs. The class of circle graphs is a subclass of
polygon-circle graphs and a superclass of t-polygon graphs. Therefore, the
problem of computing K-terminal reliability for circle graphs is of particular
interest. This paper proves that the problem remains #P-complete even for
circle graphs. Additionally, this paper proposes a linear-time algorithm for
solving the problem for proper circular-arc graphs, which are a subclass of
circle graphs and a superclass of proper interval graphs."
"We prove that triangulated IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs can be recognized
in cubic time.
  A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing
per edge. A drawing is IC-planar if, in addition, each vertex is incident to at
most one crossing edge and NIC-planar if two pairs of crossing edges share at
most one vertex. In a triangulated drawing each face is a triangle. In
consequence, planar-maximal and maximal IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs can be
recognized in O(n^5) time and maximum and optimal ones in O(n^3) time. In
contrast, recognizing 3-connected IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs is
NP-complete, even if the graphs are given with a rotation system which
describes the cyclic ordering of the edges at each vertex. Our results
complement similar ones for 1-planar graphs."
"A cocomparability graph is a graph whose complement admits a transitive
orientation. An interval graph is the intersection graph of a family of
intervals on the real line. In this paper we investigate the relationships
between interval and cocomparability graphs. This study is motivated by recent
results Corneil,Dalton, Habib (2013) and Dusart, Habib (2016) and that show
that for some problems, the algorithm used on interval graphs can also be used
with small modifications on cocomparability graphs. Many of these algorithms
are based on graph searches that preserve cocomparability orderings.
  First we propose a characterization of cocomparability graphs via a lattice
structure on the set of their maximal cliques. Using this characterization we
can prove that every maximal interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph $G$
is also a maximal chordal subgraph of $G$. Although the size of this lattice of
maximal cliques can be exponential in the size of the graph, it can be used as
a framework to design and prove algorithms on cocomparability graphs. In
particular we show that a new graph search, namely Local Maximal Neighborhood
Search (LocalMNS) leads to an $O(n+mlogn)$ time algorithm to find a maximal
interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph. Similarly we propose a linear
time algorithm to compute all simplicial vertices in a cocomparability graph.
In both cases we improve on the current state of knowledge."
"The subtree prune-and-regraft (SPR) distance metric is a fundamental way of
comparing evolutionary trees. It has wide-ranging applications, such as to
study lateral genetic transfer, viral recombination, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo phylogenetic inference. Although the rooted version of SPR distance can
be com puted relatively efficiently between rooted trees using
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms, in the unrooted case previous algorithms
are unable to compute distances larger than 7. One important tool for efficient
computation in the rooted case is called chain reduction, which replaces an
arbitrary chain of subtrees identical in both trees with a chain of three
leaves. Whether chain reduction preserves SPR distance in the unrooted case has
remained an open question since it was conjectured in 2001 by Allen and Steel,
and was presented as a challenge question at the 2007 Isaac Newton Institute
for Mathematical Sciences program on phylogenetics.
  In this paper we prove that chain reduction preserves the unrooted SPR
distance. We do so by introducing a structure called a socket agreement forest
that restricts edge modification to predetermined socket vertices, permitting
detailed analysis and modification of SPR move sequences. This new chain
reduction theorem reduces the unrooted distance problem to a linear size
problem kernel, substantially improving on the previous best quadratic size
kernel."
"A key feature of neural network architectures is their ability to support the
simultaneous interaction among large numbers of units in the learning and
processing of representations. However, how the richness of such interactions
trades off against the ability of a network to simultaneously carry out
multiple independent processes -- a salient limitation in many domains of human
cognition -- remains largely unexplored. In this paper we use a graph-theoretic
analysis of network architecture to address this question, where tasks are
represented as edges in a bipartite graph $G=(A \cup B, E)$. We define a new
measure of multitasking capacity of such networks, based on the assumptions
that tasks that \emph{need} to be multitasked rely on independent resources,
i.e., form a matching, and that tasks \emph{can} be multitasked without
interference if they form an induced matching. Our main result is an inherent
tradeoff between the multitasking capacity and the average degree of the
network that holds \emph{regardless of the network architecture}. These results
are also extended to networks of depth greater than $2$. On the positive side,
we demonstrate that networks that are random-like (e.g., locally sparse) can
have desirable multitasking properties. Our results shed light into the
parallel-processing limitations of neural systems and provide insights that may
be useful for the analysis and design of parallel architectures."
"Let G (V, E) be a simple graph with vertex set V and edge set E. A
generalized cycle is a subgraph such that any vertex degree is even. A simple
cycle (briefly in a cycle) is a connected subgraph such that every vertex has
degree 2. A basis of the cycle space is called a cycle basis of G (V, E). A
cycle basis where the sum of the weights of the cycles is minimal is called a
minimum cycle basis of G. Grinberg theorem is a necessary condition to have a
Hamilton cycle in planar graphs. In this paper, we use the cycles of a cycle
basis to replace the faces and obtain an equality of inner faces in Grinberg
theorem, called Grinberg equation. We explain why Grinberg theorem can only be
a necessary condition of Hamilton graphs and apply the theorem, to be a
necessary and sufficient condition, to simple graphs."
"This paper proposes an optimum version of the recently advanced scheme for
generalized unary coding. In this method, the block of 1s that identifies the
number is allowed to be broken up, which extends the count. The result is
established by a theorem. The number count is now n(n-k-1)+1 rather than the
previously described (n-k)(n-k)-1."
"A graph $G$ is said to be ISK4-free if it does not contain any subdivision of
$K_4$ as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we propose new upper bounds for
chromatic number of ISK4-free graphs and $\{$ISK4, triangle$\}$-free graphs."
"We give an overview of new and existing cut- and flow-based ILP formulations
for the two-stage stochastic Steiner tree problem and compare the strength of
the LP relaxations."
"The F-index of a graph is defined as the sum of cubes of the vertex degrees
of the graph which was introduced in 1972, in the same paper where the first
and second Zagreb indices were introduced. In this paper we study the F-index
of four operations on graphs which were introduced by Eliasi and Taeri [M.
Eliasi, B. Taeri, Four new sums of graphs and their Wiener indices,
\textit{Discrete Appl. Math.}\textbf{157}(2009) 794--803.]."
"In this short note we give the routing number of pyramid graph under the
\textit{routing via matching} model introduced by Alon et al\cite{5}. This
model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed network. The
nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where a node
exchanges data with its partner. Formally, given a connected graph $G$ with
vertices labeled from $[1,...,n]$ and a permutation $\pi$ giving the
destination of pebbles on the vertices the problem is to find a minimum step
routing scheme. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given
$\pi$. We show that a $d$-dimensional pyramid with $m$ levels has a routing
number of $O(dN^{1/d})$."
"A graph is even-hole-free if it has no induced even cycles of length 4 or
more. A cap is a cycle of length at least 5 with exactly one chord and that
chord creates a triangle with the cycle. In this paper, we consider (cap, even
hole)-free graphs, and more generally, (cap, 4-hole)-free odd-signable graphs.
We give an explicit construction of these graphs. We prove that every such
graph $G$ has a vertex of degree at most $\frac{3}{2}\omega (G) -1$, and hence
$\chi(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}\omega (G)$, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the size of a
largest clique in $G$ and $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$. We
give an $O(nm)$ algorithm for $q$-coloring these graphs for fixed $q$ and an
$O(nm)$ algorithm for maximum weight stable set. We also give a polynomial-time
algorithm for minimum coloring.
  Our algorithms are based on our results that triangle-free odd-signable
graphs have treewidth at most 5 and thus have clique-width at most 48, and that
(cap, 4-hole)-free odd-signable graphs $G$ without clique cutsets have
treewidth at most $6\omega(G)-1$ and clique-width at most 48."
"In the \emph{Eternal Domination} game, a team of guard tokens initially
occupies a dominating set on a graph $G$. A rioter then picks a node without a
guard on it and attacks it. The guards defend against the attack: one of them
has to move to the attacked node, while each remaining one can choose to move
to one of his neighboring nodes. The new guards' placement must again be
dominating. This attack-defend procedure continues perpetually. The guards win
if they can eternally maintain a dominating set against any sequence of
attacks, otherwise the rioter wins.
  We study rectangular grids and provide the first known general upper bound
for these graphs. Our novel strategy implements a square rotation principle and
eternally dominates $m \times n$ grids with the guards' number converging to
$20\%$ of the nodes as $m, n$ grow."
"Based on Touchard's identity, a simple derivation is given for the
enumeration of the N/S/E/W walks that remain on the north side of the origin."
"We study DAG-depth, a structural depth measure of directed graphs, which
naturally extends the tree-depth of ordinary graphs. We define a DAG-depth
decomposition as a strategy for the cop player in the lift-free version of the
cops-and-robber game on directed graphs and prove its correctness. The
DAG-depth decomposition is related to DAG-depth in a similar way as an
elimination tree is related to the tree-depth. We study the size aspect of
DAG-depth decomposition and provide a definition of mergeable and optimally
mergeable vertices in order to make the decomposition smaller and acceptable
for the cop player as a strategy. We also provide a way to find the closure of
a DAG-depth decomposition, which is the largest digraph for which the given
decomposition represents a winning strategy for the cop player."
"Let $G$ be a simple undirected graph.A broadcast on $G$ isa function $f :
V(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(v)\le e\_G(v)$ holds for every vertex
$v$ of $G$, where $e\_G(v)$ denotes the eccentricity of $v$ in $G$, that is,
the maximum distance from $v$ to any other vertex of $G$.The cost of $f$ is the
value ${\rm cost}(f)=\sum\_{v\in V(G)}f(v)$.A broadcast $f$ on $G$ is
independent if for every two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$,
$d\_G(u,v)\textgreater{}\max\{f(u),f(v)\}$,where $d\_G(u,v)$ denotes the
distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$.The broadcast independence number of $G$ is
then defined as the maximum cost of an independent broadcast on $G$. In this
paper, we study independent broadcasts of caterpillars and give an explicit
formula for the broadcast independence number of caterpillars having no pair of
adjacent vertices with degree 2."
"A fundamental characteristic of computer networks is their topological
structure. The question of the description of the structural characteristics of
computer networks represents a problem that is not completely solved. Search
methods for structures of computer networks, for which the values of the
selected parameters of their operation quality are extreme, have not been
completely developed. The construction of computer networks with optimum
indices of their operation quality is reduced to the solution of discrete
optimization problems over graphs. This paper describes in detail the
advantages of the practical use of k-geodetic graphs [2, 3] in the topological
design of computer networks as an alternative for the solution of the
fundamental problems mentioned above which, we believe, are still open. Also,
the topological analysis and synthesis of some classes of these networks have
been performed."
"A vertex set $D$ in a finite undirected graph $G$ is an {\em efficient
dominating set} (\emph{e.d.s.}\ for short) of $G$ if every vertex of $G$ is
dominated by exactly one vertex of $D$. The \emph{Efficient Domination} (ED)
problem, which asks for the existence of an e.d.s.\ in $G$, is known to be
\NP-complete even for very restricted graph classes such as for $2P_3$-free
chordal graphs while it is solvable in polynomial time for $P_6$-free chordal
graphs (and even for $P_6$-free graphs). A standard reduction from the
\NP-complete Exact Cover problem shows that ED is \NP-complete for a very
special subclass of chordal graphs generalizing split graphs; we call this
graph class {\em split-matching-extended graphs} (which can be characterized by
forbidden induced subgraphs). The reduction implies that ED is \NP-complete
e.g.\ for double-gem-free chordal graphs while it is polynomial for gem-free
chordal graphs (by various reasons such as bounded clique-width,
distance-hereditary graphs, chordal square etc.) Moreover, we investigate the
complexity of (weighted) ED for some other cases of $H$-free chordal graphs for
examples of $H$ such as $K_3+P_2$, co-$P$, net, $S_{1,2,2}$, and $S_{1,2,3}$."
"A graph is NIC-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge and such that two pairs of crossing edges share at most one
common end vertex. NIC-planarity generalizes IC-planarity, which allows a
vertex to be incident to at most one crossing edge, and specializes
1-planarity, which only requires at most one crossing per edge.
  We characterize embeddings of maximal NIC-planar graphs in terms of
generalized planar dual graphs. The characterization is used to derive tight
bounds on the density of maximal NIC-planar graphs which ranges between
3.2(n-2) and 3.6(n-2). Further, we prove that optimal NIC-planar graphs with
3.6(n-2) edges have a unique embedding and can be recognized in linear time,
whereas the general recognition problem of NIC-planar graphs is NP-complete. In
addition, we show that there are NIC-planar graphs that do not admit right
angle crossing drawings, which distinguishes NIC-planar from IC-planar graphs."
"There is a digraph corresponding to every square matrix over $\mathbb{C}$. We
generate a recurrence relation using the Laplace expansion to calculate the
characteristic, and permanent polynomials of a square matrix. Solving this
recurrence relation, we found that the characteristic, and permanent
polynomials can be calculated in terms of characteristic, and permanent
polynomials of some specific induced subdigraphs of blocks in the digraph,
respectively. Interestingly, these induced subdigraphs are vertex-disjoint and
they partition the digraph. Similar to the characteristic, and permanent
polynomials; the determinant, and permanent can also be calculated. Therefore,
this article provides a combinatorial meaning of these useful quantities of the
matrix theory. We conclude this article with a number of open problems which
may be attempted for further research in this direction."
"In this paper we extend the known results of analytic connectivity to
non-uniform hypergraphs. We prove a modified Cheeger's inequality and also give
a bound on analytic connectivity with respect to the degree sequence and
diameter of a hypergraph."
"Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) have been widely studied both
in AI and complexity theory. Empirically and theoretically, many random CSPs
have been shown to exhibit a phase transition. As the ratio of constraints to
variables passes certain thresholds, they transition from being almost
certainly satisfiable to unsatisfiable. The exact location of this threshold
has been thoroughly investigated, but only for certain common classes of
constraints. In this paper, we present new bounds for the location of these
thresholds in boolean CSPs. Our main contribution is that our bounds are fully
general, and apply to any fixed constraint function that could be used to
generate an ensemble of random CSPs. These bounds rely on a novel Fourier
analysis and can be easily computed from the Fourier spectrum of a constraint
function. Our bounds are within a constant factor of the exact threshold
location for many well-studied random CSPs. We demonstrate that our bounds can
be easily instantiated to obtain thresholds for many constraint functions that
had not been previously studied, and evaluate them experimentally."
"A proper labeling of a graph is an assignment of integers to some elements of
a graph, which may be the vertices, the edges, or both of them, such that we
obtain a proper vertex coloring via the labeling subject to some conditions.
The problem of proper labeling offers many variants and received a great
interest during recent years. We consider the algorithmic complexity of some
variants of the proper labeling problems, we present some polynomial time
algorithms and $ \mathbf{NP} $-completeness results for them."
"Given pairwise distinct vertices $\{\alpha_i , \beta_i\}^k_{i=1}$ of the
$n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ such that the distance of $\alpha_i$ and
$\beta_i$ is odd, are there paths $P_i$ between $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ such
that $\{V (P_i)\}^k_{i=1}$ partitions $V(Q_n)$? A positive solution for every
$n\ge1$ and $k=1$ is known as a Gray code of dimension $n$. In this paper we
settle this problem for small values of $n$."
"In this paper, we reveal a relation between joint winner property (JWP) in
the field of valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) and
M${}^\natural$-convexity in the field of discrete convex analysis (DCA). We
introduce the M${}^\natural$-convex completion problem, and show that a
function $f$ satisfying JWP is Z-free if and only if a certain function
$\overline{f}$ associated with $f$ is M${}^\natural$-convex completable. This
means that if a function is Z-free, then the function can be minimized in
polynomial time via M${}^\natural$-convex intersection algorithms. Furthermore
we propose a new algorithm for Z-free function minimization, which is faster
than previous algorithms for some parameter values."
"Generalized Fibonacci-like sequences appear in finite difference
approximations of the Partial Differential Equations based upon replacing
partial differential equations by finite difference equations. This paper
studies properties of the generalized Fibonacci-like sequence
F_(n+2)=A+BF_(n+1)+CF_n. It is shown that this sequence is periodic with the
period T>2 if C=-1,|B|<2."
"Comparing alternatives in pairs is a well-known method of ranking creation.
Experts are asked to perform a series of binary comparisons and then, using
mathematical methods, the final ranking is prepared. As experts conduct the
individual assessments, they may not always be consistent. The level of
inconsistency among individual assessments is widely accepted as a measure of
the ranking quality. The higher the ranking quality, the greater its
credibility. One way to determine the level of inconsistency among the paired
comparisons is to calculate the value of the inconsistency index. One of the
earliest and most widespread inconsistency indexes is the consistency
coefficient defined by Kendall and Babington Smith. In their work, the authors
consider binary pairwise comparisons, i.e., those where the result of an
individual comparison can only be: better or worse. The presented work extends
the Kendall and Babington Smith index to sets of paired comparisons with ties.
Hence, this extension allows the decision makers to determine the inconsistency
for sets of paired comparisons, where the result may also be ""equal."" The
article contains a definition and analysis of the most inconsistent set of
pairwise comparisons with and without ties. It is also shown that the most
inconsistent set of pairwise comparisons with ties represents a special case of
the more general set cover problem."
"A $k$-subcoloring of a graph is a partition of the vertex set into at most
$k$ cluster graphs, that is, graphs with no induced $P_3$. 2-subcoloring is
known to be NP-complete for comparability graphs and three subclasses of planar
graphs, namely triangle-free planar graphs with maximum degree 4, planar
perfect graphs with maximum degree 4, and planar graphs with girth 5. We show
that 2-subcoloring is also NP-complete for planar comparability graphs with
maximum degree 4."
"Recently, Deshpande et al. introduced a new measure of the complexity of a
Boolean function. We call this measure the ""goal value"" of the function. The
goal value of $f$ is defined in terms of a monotone, submodular utility
function associated with $f$. As shown by Deshpande et al., proving that a
Boolean function $f$ has small goal value can lead to a good approximation
algorithm for the Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation problem for $f$. Also,
if $f$ has small goal value, it indicates a close relationship between two
other measures of the complexity of $f$, its average-case decision tree
complexity and its average-case certificate complexity. In this paper, we
explore the goal value measure in detail. We present bounds on the goal values
of arbitrary and specific Boolean functions, and present results on properties
of the measure. We compare the goal value measure to other, previously studied,
measures of the complexity of Boolean functions. Finally, we discuss a number
of open questions provoked by our work."
"The weighted tree augmentation problem (WTAP) is a fundamental network design
problem. We are given an undirected tree $G = (V,E)$, an additional set of
edges $L$ called links and a cost vector $c \in \mathbb{R}^L_{\geq 1}$. The
goal is to choose a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq L$ such that $G = (V, E
\cup S)$ is $2$-edge-connected. In the unweighted case, that is, when we have
$c_\ell = 1$ for all $\ell \in L$, the problem is called the tree augmentation
problem (TAP).
  Both problems are known to be APX-hard, and the best known approximation
factors are $2$ for WTAP by (Frederickson and J\'aJ\'a, '81) and $\tfrac{3}{2}$
for TAP due to (Kortsarz and Nutov, TALG '16). In the case where all link costs
are bounded by a constant $M$, (Adjiashvili, SODA '17) recently gave a $\approx
1.96418+\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm for WTAP under this assumption.
This is the first approximation with a better guarantee than $2$ that does not
require restrictions on the structure of the tree or the links.
  In this paper, we improve Adjiashvili's approximation to a
$\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$-approximation for WTAP under the bounded cost
assumption. We achieve this by introducing a strong LP that combines
$\{0,\frac{1}{2}\}$-Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts for the standard LP for the problem
with bundle constraints from Adjiashvili. We show that our LP can be solved
efficiently and that it is exact for some instances that arise at the core of
Adjiashvili's approach. This results in the improved guarantee of
$\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$. For TAP, this is the best known LP-based result, and
matches the bound of $\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$ achieved by the best SDP-based
algorithm due to (Cheriyan and Gao, arXiv '15)."
"In this work we deal with the so-called path convexities, defined over
special collections of paths. For example, the collection of the shortest paths
in a graph is associated with the well-known geodesic convexity, while the
collection of the induced paths is associated with the monophonic convexity;
and there are many other examples. Besides reviewing the path convexities in
the literature, we propose a general path convexity framework, of which most
existing path convexities can be viewed as particular cases. Some benefits of
the proposed framework are the systematization of the algorithmic study of
related problems and the possibility of defining new convexities not yet
investigated."
"In a signed graph $G$, a negative clique is a complete subgraph having
negative edges only. In this article, we give characteristic polynomial
expressions, and eigenvalues of some signed graphs having negative cliques.
This includes signed cycle graph, signed path graph, a complete graph with
disjoint negative cliques, and star block graph with negative cliques."
"We propose a multi-shell sampling grid and develop corresponding transforms
for the accurate reconstruction of the diffusion signal in diffusion MRI by
expansion in the spherical polar Fourier (SPF) basis. The transform is exact in
the radial direction and accurate, on the order of machine precision, in the
angular direction. The sampling scheme uses an optimal number of samples equal
to the degrees of freedom of the diffusion signal in the SPF domain."
"In this study, we provide mathematical and practice-driven justification for
using $[0,1]$ normalization of inconsistency indicators in pairwise
comparisons. The need for normalization, as well as problems with the lack of
normalization, are presented. A new type of paradox of infinity is described."
"In our paper we consider the Cell Formation Problem in Group Technology with
grouping efficiency as an objective function. We present a heuristic approach
for obtaining high-quality solutions of the CFP. The suggested heuristic
applies an improvement procedure to obtain solutions with high grouping
efficiency. This procedure is repeated many times for randomly generated cell
configurations. Our computational experiments are performed for popular
benchmark instances taken from the literature with sizes from 10x20 to 50x150.
Better solutions unknown before are found for 23 instances of the 24
considered."
"The paper proves that for any second order conservative constraint language
with a Maltsev polymorphism there is a majority polymorphism. Moreover, the
majority polymorphism can be defined by the Maltsev polymorphism."
"The modular decomposition of a graph $G=(V,E)$ does not contain prime modules
if and only if $G$ is a cograph, that is, if no quadruple of vertices induces a
simple connected path $P_4$. The cograph editing problem consists in inserting
into and deleting from $G$ a set $F$ of edges so that $H=(V,E\Delta F)$ is a
cograph and $|F|$ is minimum. This NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem
has recently found applications, e.g., in the context of phylogenetics.
Efficient heuristics are hence of practical importance. The simple
characterization of cographs in terms of their modular decomposition suggests
that instead of editing $G$ one could operate directly on the modular
decomposition. We show here that editing the induced $P_4$s is equivalent to
resolving prime modules by means of a suitable defined merge operation on the
submodules. Moreover, we characterize so-called module-preserving edit sets and
demonstrate that optimal pairwise sequences of module-preserving edit sets
exist for every non-cograph."
"A graph $G$ is a {\em chordal-$k$-generalized split graph} if $G$ is chordal
and there is a clique $Q$ in $G$ such that every connected component in $G[V
\setminus Q]$ has at most $k$ vertices. Thus, chordal-$1$-generalized split
graphs are exactly the split graphs.
  We characterize chordal-$k$-generalized split graphs by forbidden induced
subgraphs. Moreover, we characterize a very special case of
chordal-$2$-generalized split graphs for which the Efficient Domination problem
is \NP-complete."
"The search of spanning trees with interesting disjunction properties has led
to the introduction of edge-disjoint spanning trees, independent spanning trees
and more recently completely independent spanning trees. We group together
these notions by defining (i, j)-disjoint spanning trees, where i (j,
respectively) is the number of vertices (edges, respectively) that are shared
by more than one tree. We illustrate how (i, j)-disjoint spanning trees provide
some nuances between the existence of disjoint connected dominating sets and
completely independent spanning trees. We prove that determining if there exist
two (i, j)-disjoint spanning trees in a graph G is NP-complete, for every two
positive integers i and j. Moreover we prove that for square of graphs,
k-connected interval graphs, complete graphs and several grids, there exist (i,
j)-disjoint spanning trees for interesting values of i and j."
"The runtime performance of modern SAT solvers on random $k$-CNF formulas is
deeply connected with the 'phase-transition' phenomenon seen empirically in the
satisfiability of random $k$-CNF formulas. Recent universal hashing-based
approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance
of SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both $k$-CNF and XOR
constraints (known as $k$-CNF-XOR formulas), but the behavior of random
$k$-CNF-XOR formulas is unexplored in prior work. In this paper, we present the
first study of the satisfiability of random $k$-CNF-XOR formulas. We show
empirical evidence of a surprising phase-transition that follows a linear
trade-off between $k$-CNF and XOR constraints. Furthermore, we prove that a
phase-transition for $k$-CNF-XOR formulas exists for $k = 2$ and (when the
number of $k$-CNF constraints is small) for $k > 2$."
"A method of determining two factors of an odd integer without need of
multiplication or division operation in iterative portion of computation is
presented. It is feasible for an implementing algorithm to use only integer
addition and subtraction throughout. Presentation of material is
non-theoretical; intended to be accessible to a broader audience of non
academic and theoretical practitioners."
"A linear arrangement is a labeling or a numbering or a linear ordering of the
vertices of a graph. In this paper we solve the minimum linear arrangement
problem for bijective connection graphs (for short BC graphs) which include
hypercubes, M\""{o}bius cubes, crossed cubes, twisted cubes, locally twisted
cube, spined cube, $Z$-cubes, etc. as the subfamilies."
"This paper gives an algebraic proof of the correctness of Von Schelling
formula for the probability of the coupon collector problem waiting time for
non-uniform distributions and partial collections. It introduces a theorem on
sums of powers of subset probabilities which to our knowledge is new. A set of
binomial coefficients is used as a basis for decomposition of these sums of
powers."
"In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a given
graph contains a subdivision of $K_4$ as an induced subgraph."
"Vertex Descent is a local search algorithm which forms the basis of a wide
spectrum of tabu search, simulated annealing and hybrid evolutionary algorithms
for graph colouring. These algorithms are usually treated as experimental and
provide strong results on established benchmarks. As a step towards studying
these heuristics analytically, an analysis of the behaviour of Vertex Descent
is provided. It is shown that Vertex Descent is able to find feasible
colourings for several types of instances in expected polynomial time. This
includes 2-colouring of paths and 3-colouring of graphs with maximum degree 3.
The same also holds for 3-colouring of a subset of 3-colourable graphs with
maximum degree 4. As a consequence, Vertex Descent finds a 3-colouring in
expected polynomial time for the smallest graph for which Br\'elaz's heuristic
DSATUR needs 4 colours. On the other hand, Vertex Descent may fail for forests
with maximum degree 3 with high probability."
"We define a special case of tree decompositions for planar graphs that
respect a given embedding of the graph. We study the analogous width of the
resulting decomposition we call the embedded-width of a plane graph. We show
both upper bounds and lower bounds for the embedded-width of a graph in terms
of its treewidth and describe a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to
calculate the embedded-width of a plane graph. To do so, we give novel bounds
on the size of matchings in planar graphs."
"A common task in phylogenetics is to find an evolutionary tree representing
proximity relationships between species. This motivates the notion of leaf
powers: a graph G = (V, E) is a leaf power if there exist a tree T on leafset V
and a threshold k such that uv is an edge if and only if the distance between u
and v in T is at most k. Characterizing leaf powers is a challenging open
problem, along with determining the complexity of their recognition. This is in
part due to the fact that few graphs are known to not be leaf powers, as such
graphs are difficult to construct. Recently, Nevries and Rosenke asked if leaf
powers could be characterized by strong chordality and a finite set of
forbidden subgraphs.
  In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this question, by exhibiting
an infinite family \G of (minimal) strongly chordal graphs that are not leaf
powers. During the process, we establish a connection between leaf powers,
alternating cycles and quartet compatibility. We also show that deciding if a
chordal graph is \G-free is NP-complete, which may provide insight on the
complexity of the leaf power recognition problem."
"We give an $O(n^4)$ algorithm to find a minimum clique cover of a (bull,
$C_4$)-free graph, or equivalently, a minimum colouring of a (bull,
$2K_2$)-free graph, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graphs."
"Graphs with bounded thinness were defined in 2007 as a generalization of
interval graphs. In this paper we introduce the concept of proper thinness,
such that graphs with bounded proper thinness generalize proper interval
graphs. We study the complexity of problems related to the computation of these
parameters, describe the behavior of the thinness and proper thinness under
three graph operations, and relate thinness and proper thinness with other
graph invariants in the literature. Finally, we describe a wide family of
problems that can be solved in polynomial time for graphs with bounded
thinness, generalizing for example list matrix partition problems with bounded
size matrix, and enlarge this family of problems for graphs with bounded proper
thinness, including domination problems."
"This paper is devoted to understanding the shortest augmenting path approach
for computing a maximum matching. Despite its apparent potential for designing
efficient matching and flow algorithms, it has been poorly understood.
Chaudhuri et. al. [K. Chaudhuri, C. Daskalakis, R. D. Kleinberg, and H. Lin.
Online bipartite perfect matching with augmentations. In INFOCOM 2009.] study
this classical approach in the following model. A bipartite graph $G=W \uplus
B$ is revealed online and in each round a vertex of $b$ is presented together
with the adjacent edges. It is then matched by applying the shortest among the
augmenting paths. Chaudhuri et. al. conjecture that the total length of the
augmenting paths is $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the
final graph. Recently a bound of $O(n \log^2 n)$ has been proven given that the
underlying graph is a tree [B. Bosek, D. Leniowski, P. Sankowski, and A. Zych.
Shortest augmenting paths for online matchings on trees. In WAOA 2015]. We
further improve this bound to $O(n \log n)$. To achieve that, we introduce
brand new techniques that we believe are applicable to bipartite graphs as
well."
"In a model of network communication based on a random walk in an undirected
graph, what subset of nodes (subject to constraints on the set size), enables
the fastest spread of information? In this paper, we assume the dynamics of
spread is described by a network consensus process, but to find the most
effective seeds we consider the target set of a random walk--the process dual
to network consensus spread. Thus an optimal set $A$ minimizes the sum of the
expected first hitting times $F(A)$ of random walks that start at nodes outside
the set. We introduce a submodular, non-decreasing rank function $\rho$, that
permits some comparison between the solution obtained by the classical greedy
algorithm and one obtained by our methods. The supermodularity and
non-increasing properties of $F$ are used to show that the rank of our solution
is at least $(1-\frac{1}{e})$ times the rank of the optimal set. When our
approximation has a higher rank than the greedy solution, this can be improved
to $(1-\frac{1}{e})(1+\chi)$ where $\chi >0$ is a constant. A non-zero lower
bound for $\chi$ can be obtained when the curvature and increments of $\rho$
are known."
"We consider the recent works of \cite{AIJACM,HV,Harmonic} that provide tools
for analyzing focused stochastic local search algorithms that arise from
algorithmizations of the Lovasz Local Lemma \cite{LLL} (LLL) in general
probability spaces. These are algorithms which search a state space
probabilistically by repeatedly selecting a ""flaw"" that is currently present
and moving to a random nearby state in an effort to address it and, eventually,
reach a flawless state.
  While the original Moser-Tardos \cite{MT} (MT) algorithm is amenable to the
analysis of these abstract frameworks, many follow-up results
\cite{Haeupler_jacm,EnuHarris,szege_meet,determ,distributed,ParallelHarris}
that further enhance, or exploit, our understanding of the MT process are not
transferable to these general settings. Mainly, this is because a key
ingredient of the original analysis of Moser and Tardos, the \emph{witness tree
lemma}, does not longer hold.
  In this work, we show that we can recover the witness tree lemma in the
""commutative setting"". The latter was recently introduced by Kolmogorov
\cite{Kolmofocs} and captures the vast majority of the LLL applications. Armed
with it, we focus on studying properties of commutative algorithms and give
several applications. Among other things, we are able to generalize and extend
to the commutative setting the main result of \cite{Haeupler_jacm} which states
that the output of the MT algorithm well-approximates the conditional
LLL-distribution, i.e., the distribution obtained by conditioning on all bad
events being avoided."
"The generalized hierarchical product of graphs was introduced by L.
Barri\'ere et al in 2009. In this paper, reformulated first Zagreb index of
generalized hierarchical product of two connected graphs and hence as a special
case cluster product of graphs are obtained. Finally using the derived results
the reformulated first Zagreb index of some chemically important graphs such as
square comb lattice, hexagonal chain, molecular graph of truncated cube, dimer
fullerene, zig-zag polyhex nanotube and dicentric dendrimers are computed."
"Partly in service of exploring the formal basis for Georgetown University's
AvesTerra database structure, we formalize a recursive hypergraph data
structure, which we call an ubergraph."
"A graph $G$ is equitably $k$-colorable if its vertices can be partitioned
into $k$ independent sets in such a way that the number of vertices in any two
sets differ by at most one. The smallest integer $k$ for which such a coloring
exists is known as the \emph{equitable chromatic number} of $G$ and it is
denoted by $\chi_{=}(G)$.
  In this paper the problem of determinig the value of equitable chromatic
number for multicoronas of cubic graphs $G \circ^l H$ is studied. The problem
of ordinary coloring of multicoronas of cubic graphs is solvable in polynomial
time. The complexity of equitable coloring problem is an open question for
these graphs. We provide some polynomially solvable cases of cubical
multicoronas and give simple linear time algorithms for equitable coloring of
such graphs which use at most $\chi_=(G \circ ^l H) + 1$ colors in the
remaining cases."
"Robust network flows are a concept for dealing with uncertainty and
unforeseen failures in the network infrastructure. They and their dual
counterpart, network flow interdiction, have received steady attention within
the operations research community over the past years. One of the most basic
models is the Maximum Robust Flow Problem: Given a network and an integer k,
the task is to find a path flow of maximum robust value, i.e., the guaranteed
value of surviving flow after removal of any k arcs in the network. The
complexity of this problem appeared to have been settled almost a decade ago:
Aneja et al. (2001) showed that the problem can be solved efficiently when k =
1, while an article by Du and Chandrasekaran (2007) established that the
problem is NP-hard for any constant value of k larger than 1.
  We point to a flaw in the proof of the latter result, leaving the complexity
for constant k open once again. For the case that k is not bounded by a
constant, we present a new hardness proof, establishing that the problem is
strongly NP-hard, even when only two different capacity values occur and the
number of paths is polynomial in the size of the input."
"We present a general approximation framework for weighted integer covering
problems. In a weighted integer covering problem, the goal is to determine a
non-negative integer solution $x$ to system $\{ Ax \geq r \}$ minimizing a
non-negative cost function $c^T x$ (of appropriate dimensions). All
coefficients in matrix $A$ are assumed to be non-negative. We analyze the
performance of a very simple primal-dual greedy algorithm and discuss
conditions of system $(A,r)$ that guarantee feasibility of the constructed
solutions, and a bounded approximation factor. We call system $(A,r)$ a
\emph{greedy system} if it satisfies certain properties introduced in this
work. These properties highly rely on monotonicity and supermodularity
conditions on $A$ and $r$, and can thus be seen as a far reaching
generalization of contra-polymatroids. Given a greedy system $(A,r)$, we
carefully construct a truncated system $(A',r)$ containing the same integer
feasible points. We show that our primal-dual greedy algorithm when applied to
the truncated system $(A',r)$ obtains a feasible solution to $(A,r)$ with
approximation factor at most $2\delta + 1$, or $2\delta$ if $r$ is
non-negative. Here, $\delta$ is some characteristic of the truncated matrix
$A'$ which is small in many applications. The analysis is shown to be tight up
to constant factors. We also provide an approximation factor of $k (\delta +
1)$ if the greedy algorithm is applied to the intersection of multiple greedy
systems. The parameter $k$ is always bounded by the number of greedy systems
but may be much smaller. Again, we show that the dependency on $k$ is tight. We
conclude this paper with an exposition of classical approximation results based
on primal-dual algorithms that are covered by our framework. We match all of
the known results. Additionally, we provide some new insight in a
generalization of the flow cover on a line problem."
"The problem of efficiently characterizing degree sequences of simple
hypergraphs is a fundamental long-standing open problem in Graph Theory.
Several results are known for restricted versions of this problem. This paper
adds to the list of sufficient conditions for a degree sequence to be {\em
hypergraphic}. This paper proves a combinatorial lemma about cyclically
permuting the columns of a binary table with length $n$ binary sequences as
rows. We prove that for any set of cyclic permutations acting on its columns,
the resulting table has all of its $2^n$ rows distinct. Using this property, we
first define a subset {\em cyclic hyper degrees} of hypergraphic sequences and
show that they admit a polynomial time recognition algorithm. Next, we prove
that there are at least $2^{\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}}$ {\em cyclic hyper degrees},
which also serves as a lower bound on the number of {\em hypergraphic}
sequences. The {\em cyclic hyper degrees} also enjoy a structural
characterization, they are the integral points contained in the union of some
$n$-dimensional rectangles."
"In this paper we study the shifts, which are the shift-invariant and
topologically closed sets of configurations over a finite alphabet in
$\mathbb{Z}^d$. The minimal shifts are those shifts in which all configurations
contain exactly the same patterns. Two classes of shifts play a prominent role
in symbolic dynamics, in language theory and in the theory of computability:
the shifts of finite type (obtained by forbidding a finite number of finite
patterns) and the effective shifts (obtained by forbidding a computably
enumerable set of finite patterns). We prove that every effective minimal shift
can be represented as a factor of a projective subdynamics on a minimal shift
of finite type in a bigger (by $1$) dimension. This result transfers to the
class of minimal shifts a theorem by M.Hochman known for the class of all
effective shifts and thus answers an open question by E.Jeandel. We prove a
similar result for quasiperiodic shifts and also show that there exists a
quasiperiodic shift of finite type for which Kolmogorov complexity of all
patterns of size $n\times n$ is $\Omega(n)$."
"In the absence of horizontal gene transfer it is possible to reconstruct the
history of gene families from empirically determined orthology relations, which
are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees. Knowledge of the event labels
considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species
trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the
event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled
case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here
we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation
problem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency
for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a
convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of
time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak
conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which
evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an
O(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent
reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit
timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking
whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The combinatorial characterization
of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an
important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal
transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees.
The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context
because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree
reconciliation problems."
"Finding the exact integrality gap $\alpha$ for the LP relaxation of the
metric Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been an open problem for over
thirty years, with little progress made. It is known that $4/3 \leq \alpha \leq
3/2$, and a famous conjecture states $\alpha = 4/3$. For this problem,
essentially two ""fundamental"" classes of instances have been proposed. This
fundamental property means that in order to show that the integrality gap is at
most $\rho$ for all instances of metric TSP, it is sufficient to show it only
for the instances in the fundamental class. However, despite the importance and
the simplicity of such classes, no apparent effort has been deployed for
improving the integrality gap bounds for them. In this paper we take a natural
first step in this endeavour, and consider the $1/2$-integer points of one such
class. We successfully improve the upper bound for the integrality gap from
$3/2$ to $10/7$ for a superclass of these points, as well as prove a lower
bound of $4/3$ for the superclass. Our methods involve innovative applications
of tools from combinatorial optimization which have the potential to be more
broadly applied."
"Let $G$ be a graph(directed or undirected) having $k$ number of blocks. A
$\mathcal{B}$-partition of $G$ is a partition into $k$ vertex-disjoint subgraph
$(\hat{B_1},\hat{B_1},\hdots,\hat{B_k})$ such that $\hat{B}_i$ is induced
subgraph of $B_i$ for $i=1,2,\hdots,k.$ The terms
$\prod_{i=1}^{k}\det(\hat{B}_i),\ \prod_{i=1}^{k}\text{per}(\hat{B}_i)$ are
det-summands and per-summands, respectively, corresponding to the
$\mathcal{B}$-partition. The determinant and permanent of a graph having no
loops on its cut-vertices is equal to summation of det-summands and
per-summands, respectively, corresponding to all possible
$\mathcal{B}$-partitions. Thus, in this paper we calculate determinant and
permanent of some graphs, which include block graph with negatives cliques,
signed unicyclic graph, mix complete graph, negative mix complete graph, and
star mix block graphs."
"In the context of the chromatic-number problem, a critical graph is an
instance where the deletion of any element would decrease the graph's chromatic
number. Such instances have shown to be interesting objects of study for deepen
the understanding of the optimization problem.
  This work introduces critical graphs in context of Minimum Vertex Cover. We
demonstrate their potential for the generation of larger graphs with hidden a
priori known solutions. Firstly, we propose a parametrized graph-generation
process which preserves the knowledge of the minimum cover. Secondly, we
conduct a systematic search for small critical graphs. Thirdly, we illustrate
the applicability for benchmarking purposes by reporting on a series of
experiments using the state-of-the-art heuristic solver NuMVC."
"A surprising diversity of different products of hypergraphs have been
discussed in the literature. Most of the hypergraph products can be viewed as
generalizations of one of the four standard graph products. The most widely
studied variant, the so-called square product, does not have this property,
however. Here we survey the literature on hypergraph products with an emphasis
on comparing the alternative generalizations of graph products and the
relationships among them. In this context the so-called 2-sections and
L2-sections are considered. These constructions are closely linked to related
colored graph structures that seem to be a useful tool for the prime factor
decompositions w.r.t.\ specific hypergraph products. We summarize the current
knowledge on the propagation of hypergraph invariants under the different
hypergraph multiplications. While the overwhelming majority of the material
concerns finite (undirected) hypergraphs, the survey also covers a summary of
the few results on products of infinite and directed hypergraphs."
"The Maximum Balanced Biclique Problem (MBBP) is a prominent model with
numerous applications. Yet, the problem is NP-hard and thus computationally
challenging. We propose novel ideas for designing effective exact algorithms
for MBBP. Firstly, we introduce an Upper Bound Propagation procedure to
pre-compute an upper bound involving each vertex. Then we extend an existing
branch-and-bound algorithm by integrating the pre-computed upper bounds. We
also present a set of new valid inequalities induced from the upper bounds to
tighten an existing mathematical formulation for MBBP. Lastly, we investigate
another exact algorithm scheme which enumerates a subset of balanced bicliques
based on our upper bounds. Experiments show that compared to existing
approaches, the proposed algorithms and formulations are more efficient in
solving a set of random graphs and large real-life instances."
"Given a set V of n elements on m attributes, we want to find a partition of V
on the minimum number of clusters such that the associated R-squared ratio is
at least a given threshold. We denote this problem as Goal Clustering (GC).
This problem represents a new perspective, characterizing a different
methodology within unsupervised non-hierarchical clustering. In effect, while
in the k-means we set the number of clusters in advance and then test the
associated R-squared ratio; in the GC we set an R-squared threshold lower limit
in advance and minimize k. We present two Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)
based heuristics for the GC problem. The two heuristics use different
methodologies to start the VNS algorithms. One is based on the Ward's
construction and the other one resorts to the k-means method. Computational
tests are conducted over a set of large sized instances in order to show the
performance of the two proposed heuristics."
"Let $G$ be an undirected graph. An edge of $G$ dominates itself and all edges
adjacent to it. A subset $E'$ of edges of $G$ is an edge dominating set of $G$,
if every edge of the graph is dominated by some edge of $E'$. We say that $E'$
is a perfect edge dominating set of $G$, if every edge not in $E'$ is dominated
by exactly one edge of $E'$. The perfect edge dominating problem is to
determine a least cardinality perfect edge dominating set of $G$. For this
problem, we describe two NP-completeness proofs, for the classes of claw-free
graphs of degree at most 3, and for bounded degree graphs, of maximum degree at
most $d \geq 3$ and large girth. In contrast, we prove that the problem admits
an $O(n)$ time solution, for cubic claw-free graphs. In addition, we prove a
complexity dichotomy theorem for the perfect edge domination problem, based on
the results described in the paper. Finally, we describe a linear time
algorithm for finding a minimum weight perfect edge dominating set of a
$P_5$-free graph. The algorithm is robust, in the sense that, given an
arbitrary graph $G$, either it computes a minimum weight perfect edge
dominating set of $G$, or it exhibits an induced subgraph of $G$, isomorphic to
a $P_5$."
"We give a closed analytical formula for expected distance to the power $a$
between two identical general random processes, when $a$ is an even positive
number.
  As an application to sensor network we prove that the optimal transportation
cost to the power $b>0$ of the maximal random bicolored matching with edges
$\{X_k,Y_k\}$ is in $\frac{\Theta\left(n^{\frac{b}{2}+1}\right)}{{\lambda}^b}$
when $b \ge 2,$ and in $\frac{O\left(n^{\frac{b}{2}+1}\right)}{{\lambda}^b}$
when $0< b < 2.$"
"This paper describes a new approach to the problem of the structural research
of clusters based on the theory of geodetic and k-geodetic graphs. We firmly
believe that this same approach can be used when solving problems of
correlation between structural and spectral metrics in complex networks. So,
what we want to point out is about the possibility of applying one theory of
networks (the theory of k-geodetic networks) to the solution of problems in
another type of networks (complex networks). The theory of geodetic graphs and
their various modifications represents an important tool for the structural
analysis of complex systems of transmission, processing, and analysis of
information. In the case of large data sets, their stochastic dependence is
described by large-dimensional correlation matrices. One of the problems of
correlation analysis is the study of the structure of the correlation matrix.
It is proved that such a structure is adequately described by geodetic graphs.
The obtained structural data allow solving the choice problem of significant
variables in multidimensional regression models."
"Cops and robbers is a vertex-pursuit game played on graphs. In the classical
cops-and-robbers game, a set of cops and a robber occupy the vertices of the
graph and move alternately along the graph's edges with perfect information
about each other's positions. If a cop eventually occupies the same vertex as
the robber, then the cops win; the robber wins if she can indefinitely evade
capture. Aigner and Frommer established that in every connected planar graph,
three cops are sufficient to capture a single robber. In this paper, we
consider a recently studied variant of the cops-and-robbers game, alternately
called the one-active-cop game, one-cop-moves game or the lazy-cops-and-robbers
game, where at most one cop can move during any round. We show that Aigner and
Frommer's result does not generalise to this game variant by constructing a
connected planar graph on which a robber can indefinitely evade three cops in
the one-cop-moves game. This answers a question recently raised by Sullivan,
Townsend and Werzanski."
"Bir\'{o}, Hujter, and Tuza introduced the concept of $H$-graphs (1992),
intersection graphs of connected subgraphs of a subdivision of a graph $H$.
They naturally generalize many important classes of graphs, e.g., interval
graphs and circular-arc graphs. We continue the study of these graph classes by
considering coloring, clique, and isomorphism problems on $H$-graphs.
  We show that for any fixed $H$ containing a certain 3-node, 6-edge multigraph
as a minor that the clique problem is APX-hard on $H$-graphs and the
isomorphism problem is isomorphism-complete. We also provide positive results
on $H$-graphs. Namely, when $H$ is a cactus the clique problem can be solved in
polynomial time. Also, when a graph $G$ has a Helly $H$-representation, the
clique problem can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we observe that one
can use treewidth techniques to show that both the $k$-clique and list
$k$-coloring problems are FPT on $H$-graphs. These FPT results apply more
generally to treewidth-bounded graph classes where treewidth is bounded by a
function of the clique number."
"The partial representation extension problem, introduced by Klav\'{i}k et al.
(2011), generalizes the recognition problem. In this short note we show that
this problem is NP-complete for unit circular-arc graphs."
"A shift rule for the prefer-max De Bruijn sequence is formulated, for all
sequence orders, and over any finite alphabet. An efficient algorithm for this
shift rule is presented, which has linear (in the sequence order) time and
memory complexity."
"We study the single machine scheduling problem with the objective to minimize
the total weight of late jobs. It is assumed that the processing times of jobs
are not exactly known at the time when a complete schedule must be dispatched.
Instead, only interval bounds for these parameters are given. In contrast to
the stochastic optimization approach, we consider the problem of finding a
robust schedule, which minimizes the maximum regret of a solution. Heuristic
algorithm based on mixed-integer linear programming is presented and examined
through computational experiments."
"We show that, up to renaming of the letters, the only infinite ternary words
avoiding the formula $ABCAB.ABCBA.ACB.BAC$ (resp. $ABCA.BCAB.BCB.CBA$) have the
same set of recurrent factors as the fixed point of
$\texttt{0}\mapsto\texttt{012}$, $\texttt{1}\mapsto\texttt{02}$,
$\texttt{2}\mapsto\texttt{1}$. Also, we show that the formula $ABAC.BACA.ABCA$
is $2$-avoidable. Finally, we show that the pattern $ABACADABCA$ is unavoidable
for the class of $C_4$-minor-free graphs with maximum degree $3$. This
disproves a conjecture of Grytczuk."
"This article surveys the known results (and not very well-known results)
associated with Cantor's pairing function and the Rosenberg-Strong pairing
function, including their inverses, their generalizations to higher dimensions,
and a discussion of a few of the advantages of the Rosenberg-Strong pairing
function over Cantor's pairing function in practical applications. In
particular, an application to the problem of enumerating full binary trees is
discussed."
"We study the Identity problem for matrix semigroups. The Identity problem is
to decide whether there exists the identity matrix in the given matrix
semigroup. It has been recently shown that the Identity problem is NP-complete
for a matrix semigroup generated by matrices from the Special Linear Group
SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and it is undecidable for semigroups generated by 48
matrices from SL$(4,\mathbb{Z})$. Many computational problems for matrix
semigroups and groups are computationally hard starting from dimension two and
very often become undecidable from dimension three and four even in the case of
integer matrices. All undecidability proofs for matrix problems require
injective semigroup morphism from a pair of words over any finite alphabet into
matrices. In this paper we significantly expand the horizon of known
decidability area for matrix semigroups by showing that there is no embedding
from a set of pairs of words over a semigroup alphabet to any matrix semigroup
in SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ and consequently show that there is no embedding from a
set of pairs of group words into $\mathbb{Z}^{3 \times 3}$.
  As the decidability status of the Identity problem in dimension three is
still a long standing open problem, we look for an important subgroup of
SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$, the Heisenberg group H$(3,\mathbb{Z})$, for which the
Identity problem could be decidable following our result on non-existence of
embedding. We show that the Identity problem for a matrix semigroup generated
by matrices from H$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ and even H$(3,\mathbb{Q})$ is decidable in
polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend the decidability result for
H$(n,\mathbb{Q})$ in any dimension $n$.
  Moreover we are tightening the gap between decidability and undecidability
results by reducing the bound on the size of the generator set from 48 to 9 for
$4\times4$ matrix semigroups over integers."
"Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite undirected graph without loops and multiple edges.
An edge set $E' \subseteq E$ is a {\em dominating induced matching} ({\em
d.i.m.}) in $G$ if every edge in $E$ is intersected by exactly one edge of
$E'$. In particular, this means that $E'$ is an induced matching, and every
edge not in $E'$ shares exactly one vertex with an edge in $E'$. Clearly, not
every graph has a d.i.m.
  The \emph{Dominating Induced Matching} (\emph{DIM}) problem asks for the
existence of a d.i.m.\ in $G$; this problem is also known as the
\emph{Efficient Edge Domination} problem; it is the {\em Efficient Domination}
problem for line graphs.
  The DIM problem is \NP-complete in general, and even for very restricted
graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3. However,
DIM is solvable in polynomial time for claw-free (i.e., $S_{1,1,1}$-free)
graphs, for $S_{1,2,3}$-free graphs, for $S_{1,2,4}$-free graphs, as well as
for $S_{2,2,2}$-free graphs, in linear time for $P_7$-free graphs, and in
polynomial time for $P_8$-free graphs. In a paper by Hertz, Lozin, Ries,
Zamaraev and de Werra, it was conjectured that DIM is solvable in polynomial
time for $S_{i,j,k}$-free graphs for every fixed $i,j,k$.
  In this paper we solve it in polynomial time for $(S_{2,2,3},S_{1,4,4})$-free
graphs (generalizing $S_{1,2,3}$-free graphs and based on the solution for
$S_{2,2,2}$-free graphs)."
"A $1$-plane graph is a graph embedded in the plane such that each edge is
crossed at most once. A NIC-plane graph is a $1$-plane graph such that any two
pairs of crossing edges share at most one end-vertex. An edge partition of a
$1$-plane graph $G$ is a coloring of the edges of $G$ with two colors, red and
blue, such that both the graph induced by the red edges and the graph induced
by the blue edges are plane graphs. We prove the following: $(i)$ Every
NIC-plane graph admits an edge partition such that the red graph has maximum
vertex degree three; this bound on the vertex degree is worst-case optimal.
$(ii)$ Deciding whether a $1$-plane graph admits an edge partition such that
the red graph has maximum vertex degree two is NP-complete. $(iii)$ Deciding
whether a $1$-plane graph admits an edge partition such that the red graph has
maximum vertex degree one, and computing one in the positive case, can be done
in quadratic time. Applications of these results to graph drawing are also
discussed."
"The reload cost refers to the cost that occurs along a path on an
edge-colored graph when it traverses an internal vertex between two edges of
different colors. Galbiati et al.[1] introduced the Minimum Reload Cost Cycle
Cover problem, which is to find a set of vertex-disjoint cycles spanning all
vertices with minimum reload cost. They proved that this problem is strongly
NP-hard and not approximable within $1/\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ even
when the number of colors is 2, the reload costs are symmetric and satisfy the
triangle inequality. In this paper, we study this problem in complete graphs
having equitable or nearly equitable 2-edge-colorings, which are edge-colorings
with two colors such that for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, $||c_1(v)| -|c_2(v)||
\leq 1$ or $||c_1(v)| -|c_2(v)|| \leq 2$, respectively, where $c_i(v)$ is the
set of edges with color $i$ that is incident to $v$. We prove that except
possibly on complete graphs with fewer than 13 vertices, the minimum reload
cost is zero on complete graphs with nearly equitable 2-edge-colorings by
proving the existence of a monochromatic cycle cover. Furthermore, we provide a
polynomial-time algorithm that constructs a monochromatic cycle cover in
complete graphs with an equitable 2-edge-coloring except possibly in a complete
graph with four vertices. Our algorithm also finds a monochromatic cycle cover
in complete graphs with a nearly equitable 2-edge-coloring except some special
cases."
"Based upon inequalities on Subset Probabilities, proofs of several
conjectures on the Generalized Coupon Collector Problem (i.e. CCP with unequal
popularity) are presented. Then we derive a very simple asymptotic relation
between the expectation of the waiting time for a partial collection in the
CCP, and the Miss rate of a LRU cache."
"A set of points $X = X_B \cup X_R \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is linearly
separable if the convex hulls of $X_B$ and $X_R$ are disjoint, hence there
exists a hyperplane separating $X_B$ from $X_R$. Such a hyperplane provides a
method for classifying new points, according to which side of the hyperplane
the new points lie. When such a linear separation is not possible, it may still
be possible to partition $X_B$ and $X_R$ into prespecified numbers of groups,
in such a way that every group from $X_B$ is linearly separable from every
group from $X_R$. We may also discard some points as outliers, and seek to
minimize the number of outliers necessary to find such a partition. Based on
these ideas, Bertsimas and Shioda proposed the classification and regression by
integer optimization (CRIO) method in 2007. In this work we explore the integer
programming aspects of the classification part of CRIO, in particular
theoretical properties of the associated formulation. We are able to find
facet-inducing inequalities coming from the stable set polytope, hence showing
that this classification problem has exploitable combinatorial properties."
"We study vertex colourings of digraphs so that no out-neighbourhood is
monochromatic and call such a colouring an {\bf out-colouring}. The problem of
deciding whether a given digraph has an out-colouring with only two colours
(called a 2-out-colouring) is ${\cal
  NP}$-complete. We show that for every choice of positive integers $r,k$ there
exists a $k$-strong bipartite tournament which needs at least $r$ colours in
every out-colouring. Our main results are on tournaments and semicomplete
digraphs. We prove that, except for the Paley tournament $P_7$, every strong
semicomplete digraph of minimum out-degree at least 3 has a 2-out-colouring.
Furthermore, we show that every semicomplete digraph on at least 7 vertices has
a 2-out-colouring if and only if it has a {\bf balanced} such colouring, that
is, the difference between the number of vertices that receive colour 1 and
colour 2 is at most one. In the second half of the paper we consider the
generalization of 2-out-colourings to vertex partitions $(V_1,V_2)$ of a
digraph $D$ so that each of the three digraphs induced by respectively, the
vertices of $V_1$, the vertices of $V_2$ and all arcs between $V_1$ and $V_2$
have minimum out-degree $k$ for a prescribed integer $k\geq 1$. Using
probabilistic arguments we prove that there exists an absolute positive
constant $c$ so that every semicomplete digraph of minimum out-degree at least
$2k+c\sqrt{k}$ has such a partition. This is tight up to the value of $c$."
"We study the problem of decomposing (clustering) a tree with respect to costs
attributed to pairs of nodes, so as to minimize the sum of costs for those
pairs of nodes that are in the same component (cluster). For the general case
and for the special case of the tree being a star, we show that the problem is
NP-hard. For the special case of the tree being a path, we show (i) the
objective function is not necessarily submodular, (ii) the problem can be
solved in quasi-polynomial time by divide-and-conquer, (iii) the problem can be
solved in polynomial time by polyhedral optimization techniques. To establish
(iii), we offer a totally dual integral (TDI) description of path partition
polytopes."
"We consider the online vector packing problem in which we have a $d$
dimensional knapsack and items $u$ with weight vectors $\mathbf{w}_u \in
\mathbb{R}_+^d$ arrive online in an arbitrary order. Upon the arrival of an
item, the algorithm must decide immediately whether to discard or accept the
item into the knapsack. When item $u$ is accepted, $\mathbf{w}_u(i)$ units of
capacity on dimension $i$ will be taken up, for each $i\in[d]$. To satisfy the
knapsack constraint, an accepted item can be later disposed of with no cost,
but discarded or disposed of items cannot be recovered. The objective is to
maximize the utility of the accepted items $S$ at the end of the algorithm,
which is given by $f(S)$ for some non-negative monotone submodular function
$f$.
  For any small constant $\epsilon > 0$, we consider the special case that the
weight of an item on every dimension is at most a $(1-\epsilon)$ fraction of
the total capacity, and give a polynomial-time deterministic
$O(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$-competitive algorithm for the problem, where $k$ is
the (column) sparsity of the weight vectors. We also show several (almost)
tight hardness results even when the algorithm is computationally unbounded. We
show that under the $\epsilon$-slack assumption, no deterministic algorithm can
obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio, and no randomized algorithm can obtain any
$o(\frac{k}{\log k})$ competitive ratio. For the general case (when $\epsilon =
0$), no randomized algorithm can obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio.
  In contrast to the $(1+\delta)$ competitive ratio achieved in Kesselheim et
al. (STOC 2014) for the problem with random arrival order of items and under
large capacity assumption, we show that in the arbitrary arrival order case,
even when $\| \mathbf{w}_u \|_\infty$ is arbitrarily small for all items $u$,
it is impossible to achieve any $o(\frac{\log k}{\log\log k})$ competitive
ratio."
"The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index is one of the most investigated
degree-based molecular structure descriptors with a variety of chemical
applications. It is known that among all connected graphs, the trees minimize
the ABC index. However, a full characterization of trees with a minimal ABC
index is still an open problem. By now, one of the proved properties is that a
tree with a minimal ABC index may have, at most, one pendent path of length
$3$, with the conjecture that it cannot be a case if the order of a tree is
larger than $1178$. Here, we provide an affirmative answer of a strengthened
version of that conjecture, showing that a tree with minimal ABC index cannot
contain a pendent path of length $3$ if its order is larger than $415$."
"This paper studies the assortment optimization problem under the General Luce
Model (GLM), a discrete choice introduced by Echenique and Saito (2015) that
generalizes the standard multinomial logit model (MNL). The GLM does not
satisfy the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property but it
ensures that each product has an intrinsic utility and uses a dominance
relation between products. Given a proposed assortment $S$, consumers first
discard all dominated products in $S$ before using a MNL model on the remaining
products. The General Luce Model may violate the traditional regularity
condition, which states that the probability of choosing a product cannot
increase if the offer set is enlarged. As a result, the model can model
behaviour that cannot be captured by any discrete choice model based on random
utilities.
  The paper proves that the assortment problem under the GLM is
polynomially-solvable. Moreover, it proves that the capacitated assortment
optimization problem under the General Luce Model (GLM) is NP-hard and presents
polynomial-time algorithms for the cases where (1) the dominance relation is
utility-correlated and (2) its transitive reduction is a forest. The proofs
exploit a strong connection between assortments under the GLM and independent
sets in comparability graphs."
"The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index has been, in recent years, one of the
most actively studied vertex-degree-based graph invariants in chemical graph
theory. For a given graph $G$, the ABC index is defined as $\sum_{uv\in
E}\sqrt{\frac{d(u) +d(v)-2}{d(u)d(v)}}$, where $d(u)$ is the degree of vertex
$u$ in $G$ and $E(G)$ denotes the set of edges of $G$. In this paper we present
some new structural properties of trees with a minimal ABC index (also refer to
as a minimal-ABC tree), which is a step further towards understanding their
complete characterization. We show that a minimal-ABC tree cannot
simultaneously contain a $B_4$-branch and $B_1$ or $B_2$-branches."
"Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite undirected graph without loops and multiple edges.
An edge set $E' \subseteq E$ is a {\em dominating induced matching} ({\em
d.i.m.}) in $G$ if every edge in $E$ is intersected by exactly one edge of
$E'$. In particular, this means that $E'$ is an induced matching, and every
edge not in $E'$ shares exactly one vertex with an edge in $E'$. Clearly, not
every graph has a d.i.m.
  The \emph{Dominating Induced Matching} (\emph{DIM}) problem asks for the
existence of a d.i.m.\ in $G$; this problem is also known as the
\emph{Efficient Edge Domination} problem; it is the Efficient Domination
problem for line graphs.
  The DIM problem is \NP-complete in general, and even for very restricted
graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3. However,
DIM is solvable in polynomial time for claw-free graphs, for $S_{1,2,3}$-free
graphs as well as for $S_{2,2,2}$-free graphs and more generally, for
$S_{2,2,3}$-free graphs, and also in linear time for $P_7$-free graphs, and in
polynomial time for $P_8$-free graphs. In a paper by Hertz, Lozin, Ries,
Zamaraev and de Werra, it was conjectured that DIM is solvable in polynomial
time for $S_{i,j,k}$-free graphs for every fixed $i,j,k$.
  In this paper we solve it in polynomial time for $S_{1,2,4}$-free graphs."
"The behavior of the simplex algorithm is a widely studied subject.
Specifically, the question of the existence of a polynomial pivot rule for the
simplex algorithm is of major importance. Here, we give exponential lower
bounds for three history-based pivot rules. Those rules decide their next step
based on memory of the past steps. In particular, we study Zadeh's least
entered rule, Johnson's least-recently basic rule and Cunningham's
least-recently considered (or round-robin) rule. We give exponential lower
bounds on Acyclic Unique Sink Orientations (AUSO) of the abstract cube, for all
of these pivot rules. For Johnson's rule our bound is the first superpolynomial
one in any context; for Zadeh's it is the first one for AUSO. Those two are our
main results."
"A family of graphs optimized as the topologies for supercomputer
interconnection networks is proposed. The special needs of such network
topologies, minimal diameter and mean path length, are met by special
constructions of the weight vectors in a representation of the symplectic
algebra. Such theoretical design of topologies can conveniently reconstruct the
mesh and hypercubic graphs, widely used as today's network topologies. Our
symplectic algebraic approach helps generate many classes of graphs suitable
for network topologies."
"We consider integer programming problems in standard form $\max \{c^Tx : Ax =
b, \, x\geq 0, \, x \in Z^n\}$ where $A \in Z^{m \times n}$, $b \in Z^m$ and $c
\in Z^n$. We show that such an integer program can be solved in time $m^{O(m)}
\cdot {\Delta}^{O(m)}$, where ${\Delta}$ is an upper bound on each absolute
value of an entry in $A$ and $b$. This improves upon the longstanding best
bound of Papadimitriou (1981) of $m^{O(m^2)} \cdot {\Delta}^{O(m^2)}$ and
addresses an open problem raised by Fomin. Our result relies on a lemma of
Steinitz that states that a set of vectors in $R^m$ that is contained in the
unit ball and that sum up to zero can be ordered such that all partial sums are
of norm bounded by $m$.
  We also use the Steinitz lemma to show that the $\ell_1$-distance of an
optimal integer and fractional solution of the integer program, also under the
presence of upper bounds on the variables, is bounded by $m \cdot (2\cdot m
\cdot {\Delta}_A+1)^m$. Here ${\Delta}_A$ is an upper bound on the absolute
values of the entries of $A$ only. The novel strength of our bound is that it
is independent of $n$. We provide evidence for the significance of our bound by
applying it to general knapsack problems where we obtain structural and
algorithmic results that improve upon the recent literature."
"The notions of bounded expansion and nowhere denseness have been applied very
successfully in algorithmic graph theory. We study the corresponding notions of
directed bounded expansion and nowhere crownfulness on directed graphs. We show
that many of the algorithmic tools that were developed for undirected bounded
expansion classes can, with some care, also be applied in their directed
counterparts, and thereby we highlight a rich algorithmic structure theory of
directed bounded expansion classes.
  More specifically, we show that the directed Steiner tree problem is
fixed-parameter tractable on any class of directed bounded expansion
parameterized by the number $k$ of non-terminals plus the maximal diameter $s$
of a strongly connected component in the subgraph induced by the terminals. Our
result strongly generalizes a result of Jones et al., who proved that the
problem is fixed parameter tractable on digraphs of bounded degeneracy if the
set of terminals is required to be acyclic.
  We furthermore prove that for every integer $r\geq 1$, the distance-$r$
dominating set problem can be approximated up to a factor $O(\log k)$ and the
connected distance-$r$ dominating set problem can be approximated up to a
factor $O(k\cdot \log k)$ on any class of directed bounded expansion, where $k$
denotes the size of an optimal solution. If furthermore, the class is nowhere
crownful, we are able to compute a polynomial kernel for distance-$r$
dominating sets. Polynomial kernels for this problem were not known to exist on
any other existing digraph measure for sparse classes."
"We study the mixing time of random walks on small-world networks modelled as
follows: starting with the 2-dimensional periodic grid, each pair of vertices
$\{u,v\}$ with distance $d>1$ is added as a ""long-range"" edge with probability
proportional to $d^{-r}$, where $r\geq 0$ is a parameter of the model.
Kleinberg studied a close variant of this network model and proved that the
(decentralised) routing time is $O((\log n)^2))$ when $r=2$ and $n^{\Omega(1)}$
when $r\neq 2$. Here, we prove that the random walk also undergoes a phase
transition at $r=2$, but in this case the phase transition is of a different
form. We establish that the mixing time is $\Theta(\log n)$ for $r<2$, $O((\log
n)^4)$ for $r=2$ and $n^{\Omega(1)}$ for $r>2$."
"A graph $G$ is matching-decyclable if it has a matching $M$ such that $G-M$
is acyclic. Deciding whether $G$ is matching-decyclable is an NP-complete
problem even if $G$ is 2-connected, planar, and subcubic. In this work we
present characterizations of matching-decyclability in the following classes:
chordal graphs, split graphs, distance-hereditary graphs, cographs, and
Hamiltonian subcubic graphs. All the characterizations lead to simple
$O(n)$-time recognition algorithms."
"We study the assortment optimization problem under the \emph{Sequential
Multinomial Logit} (SML), a discrete choice model that generalizes the
multinomial logit (MNL). Under the SML model, products are partitioned into two
levels, to capture differences in attractiveness, brand awareness and, or
visibility of the products in the market. When a consumer is presented with an
assortment of products, she first considers products in the first level and, if
none of them is purchased, products in the second level are considered. This
model is a special case of the Perception Adjusted Luce Model (PALM) recently
proposed by Echenique et al (2013). It can explain many behavioral phenomena
such as the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects which cannot be
explained by the MNL model or any discrete choice model based on random
utility. In particular, the SML model allows violations to the \emph{regularity
condition} which states that the probability of choosing a product cannot
increase if the offer set is enlarged. This paper shows that the seminal
concept of revenue-ordered assortment sets, which contain an optimal assortment
under the MNL model, can be generalized to the SML model. More precisely, the
paper proves that all optimal assortments under the SML are revenue-ordered by
level, a natural generalization of revenue-ordered assortments that contains,
at most, a quadratic number of assortments. As a corollary, assortment
optimization under the SML is polynomial-time solvable. This result is
particularly interesting given that the SML model does not satisfy the
regularity condition and, therefore, it can explain choice behaviours that
cannot be explained by any choice model based on random utility."
"The concept of power domination emerged from the problem of monitoring
electrical systems. Given a graph G and a set S $\subseteq$ V (G), a set M of
monitored vertices is built as follows: at first, M contains only the vertices
of S and their direct neighbors, and then each time a vertex in M has exactly
one neighbor not in M, this neighbor is added to M. The power domination number
of a graph G is the minimum size of a set S such that this process ends up with
the set M containing every vertex of G. We here show that the power domination
number of a triangular grid T\_k with hexagonal-shape border of length k -- 1
is exactly $\lceil k/3 \rceil."
"In shop scheduling, several applications exist where it is required that some
components perform consecutively. We refer to no-idle schedules if machines are
required to operate with no inserted idle time and no-wait schedules if tasks
cannot wait between the end of an operation and the start of the following one.
We consider here no-idle/no-wait shop scheduling problems with makespan as
performance measure and determine related complexity results. We first analyze
the two-machine no-idle/no-wait flow shop problem and show that it is
equivalent to a special version of the game of dominoes which is polynomially
solvable by tackling an Eulerian path problem on a directed graph. We present
for this problem an O(n) exact algorithm. As a byproduct we show that the
Hamiltonian Path problem on a digraph G(V,A) with a special structure (where
every pair of vertices i,j either has all successors in common or has no common
successors) reduces to the two-machine no-idle/no-wait flow shop problem.
Correspondingly, we provide a new polynomially solvable special case of the
Hamiltonian Path problem. Then, we show that also the corresponding $m$-machine
no-idle no-wait flow shop problem is polynomially solvable and provide an O(mn
log n) exact algorithm. Finally we prove that the 2-machine no-idle/no-wait job
shop problem and the 2-machine no-idle/no-wait open shop problem are NP-Hard in
the strong sense."
"We approach the tomographic problem in terms of linear system of equations
$A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{p}$ in an $(M\times N)$-sized lattice grid $\mathcal{A}$.
Using a finite number of directions always yields the presence of ghosts, so
preventing uniqueness. Ghosts can be managed by increasing the number of
directions, which implies that also the number of collected projections (also
called bins) increases. Therefore, for a best performing outcome, a kind of
compromise should be sought among the number of employed directions, the number
of collected projections, and the percentage of exactly reconstructed image. In
this paper we wish to investigate such a problem in the case of binary images.
  We move from a theoretical result that allow uniqueness in $\mathcal{A}$ with
just four suitably selected X-ray directions. This is exploited in studying the
structure of the allowed ghosts in the given lattice grid. The knowledge of the
ghost sizes, combined with geometrical information concerning the real valued
solution of $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{p}$ having minimal Euclidean norm, leads to an
explicit implementation of the previously obtained uniqueness theorem. This
provides an easy binary algorithm (BRA) that, in the grid model, quickly
returns perfect noise-free tomographic reconstructions.
  Then we focus on the tomography-side relevant problem of reducing the number
of collected projections and, in the meantime, preserving a good quality of
reconstruction. It turns out that, using sets of just four suitable directions,
a high percentage of reconstructed pixel is preserved, even when the size of
the projection vector $\mathbf{p}$ is considerably smaller than the size of the
image to be reconstructed.
  Results are commented and discussed, also showing applications of BRA on
phantoms with different features."
"For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S \subseteq V$ is a $[1,2]$-set if it is a
dominating set for $G$ and each vertex $v \in V \setminus S$ is dominated by at
most two vertices of $S$, i.e. $1 \leq \vert N(v) \cap S \vert \leq 2$.
Moreover a set $S \subseteq V$ is a total $[1,2]$-set if for each vertex of
$V$, it is the case that $1 \leq \vert N(v) \cap S \vert \leq 2$. The
$[1,2]$-domination number of $G$, denoted $\gamma_{[1,2]}(G)$,is the minimum
number of vertices in a $[1,2]$-set. Every $[1,2]$-set with cardinality of
$\gamma_{[1,2]}(G)$ is called a $\gamma_{[1,2]}$-set. Total $[1,2]$-domination
number and $\gamma_{t[1,2]}$-sets of $G$ are defined in a similar way. This
paper presents a linear time algorithm to find a $\gamma_{[1,2]}$-set and a
$\gamma_{t[1,2]}$-set in generalized series-parallel graphs."
"A dominating set in a graph $G$ is a subset of vertices $D$ such that every
vertex in $V\setminus D$ is a neighbor of some vertex of $D$. The domination
number of $G$ is the minimum size of a dominating set of $G$ and it is denoted
by $\gamma(G)$. Also, a subset $D$ of a graph $G$ is a $[ 1, 2 ] $-set if, each
vertex $v \in V \setminus D$ is adjacent to either one or two vertices in $D$
and the minimum cardinality of $[ 1, 2 ] $-dominating set of $G$, is denoted by
$\gamma_{[1,2]}(G)$.
  Chang's conjecture say that for every $16 \leq n \leq m, \gamma(G_{m,n})=
\left \lfloor\frac{(n+2)(m+2)}{5}\right \rfloor-4$ and this conjecture has been
proven by Goncalves et al. This paper presents an explicit constructing method
to find an optimal dominating set for grid graph $G_{n,m}$ where $m,n\geq 16$
in $O(\textit{size of answer})$. In addition, we will show that
$\gamma(G_{n,m})=\gamma_{[1,2]}(G_{n,m})$ holds in response to an open question
posed by Chellali et al."
"In the token jumping problem for a vertex subset problem $Q$ on graphs we are
given a graph $G$ and two feasible solutions $S_s, S_t\subseteq V(G)$ of $Q$
with $|S_s|=|S_t|$, and imagine that a token is placed on each vertex of $S_s$.
The problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ of
feasible solutions, where $S_1=S_s$, $S_n=S_t$ and each $S_{i+1}$ results from
$S_i$, $1\leq i<n$, by moving exactly one token to another vertex.
  We prove that for every nowhere dense class of graphs and for every $r\geq 1$
there exists a polynomial $p_r$ such that the token jumping problem for the
distance-$r$ independent set problem and for the distance-$r$ dominating set
problem admit kernels of size $p_r(k)$, where $k$ is the number of used tokens.
If $k$ is equal to the size of a minimum distance-$r$ dominating set, then we
even obtain a kernel of almost linear size $O(k^{1+\epsilon})$ for any fixed
$\epsilon>0$.
  We then prove that if a class~$C$ is somewhere dense and closed under taking
subgraphs, then for some value of $r\geq 1$ the reconfiguration problem for the
above problems on $C$ is $W[1]$-hard (and in particular we cannot expect the
existence of kernelization algorithms). Hence our results show that the limit
of tractability for the reconfiguration variants of the distance-$r$
independent set problem and distance-$r$ dominating set problem on subgraph
closed graph classes lies exactly on the boundary between nowhere denseness and
somewhere denseness."
"A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists an
edge-weighted tree $T$ and two non-negative real numbers $d_{min}$ and
$d_{max}$, $d_{min} \leq d_{max}$, such that each node $u \in V$ is uniquely
associated to a leaf of $T$ and there is an edge $(u,v) \in E$ if and only if
$d_{min} \leq d_{T} (u, v) \leq d_{max}$, where $d_{T} (u, v)$ is the sum of
the weights of the edges on the unique path $P_{T}(u,v)$ from $u$ to $v$ in
$T$. Understanding which graph classes lie inside and which ones outside the
PCG class is an important issue. In this paper we propose a new proof technique
that allows us to show that some interesting classes of graphs have empty
intersection with PCG. As an example, we use this technique to show that wheels
and graphs obtained as strong product between a cycle and $P_2$ are not PCGs."
"We study operators that combine combinatorial games. This field was initiated
by Sprague-Grundy (1930s), Milnor (1950s) and Berlekamp-Conway-Guy (1970-80s)
via the now classical disjunctive sum operator on (abstract) games. The new
class consists in operators for rulesets, dubbed the switch-operators. The
ordered pair of rulesets (R 1 , R 2) is compatible if, given any position in R
1 , there is a description of how to move in R 2. Given compatible (R 1 , R 2),
we build the push-the-button game R 1 R 2 , where players start by playing
according to the rules R 1 , but at some point during play, one of the players
must switch the rules to R 2 , by pushing the button"". Thus, the game ends
according to the terminal condition of ruleset R 2. We study the pairwise
combinations of the classical rulesets Nim, Wythoff and Euclid. In addition, we
prove that standard periodicity results for Subtraction games transfer to this
setting, and we give partial results for a variation of Domineering, where R 1
is the game where the players put the domino tiles horizontally and R 2 the
game where they play vertically (thus generalizing the octal game 0.07)."
"A graph is IC-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge and such that two pairs of crossing edges share no common end
vertex. IC-planarity specializes both NIC-planarity, which allows a pair of
crossing edges to share at most one vertex, and 1-planarity, where each edge
may be crossed at most once. We show that there are infinitely maximal
IC-planar graphs with n vertices and 3n-5 edges and thereby prove a tight lower
bound on the density of this class of graphs."
"During the 125th European Study Group with Industry held in Limassol, Cyprus,
5-9 December 2016, one of the participating companies, Engino.net Ltd, posed a
very interesting challenge to the members of the study group. Engino.net Ltd is
a Cypriot company, founded in 2004, that produces a series of toy sets -- the
Engino$^{\circledR}$ toy sets -- consisting of a number of building blocks
which can be assembled by pupils to compose toy models. Depending on the
contents of a particular toy set, the company has developed a number of models
that can be built utilizing the blocks present in the set, however the
production of a step-by-step assembly manual for each model could only be done
manually. The goal of the challenge posed by the company was to implement a
procedure to automatically generate the assembly instructions for a given toy.
In the present paper we propose a graph-theoretic approach to model the problem
and provide a series of results to solve it by employing modified versions of
well established algorithms in graph theory. An algorithmic procedure to obtain
a hierarchical, physically feasible decomposition of a given toy model, from
which the assembly instructions can be recovered, is proposed."
"This paper investigates the size in bits of the LZ77 encoding, which is the
most popular and efficient variant of the Lempel-Ziv encodings used in data
compression. We prove that, for a wide natural class of variable-length
encoders for LZ77 phrases, the size of the greedily constructed LZ77 encoding
on constant alphabets is within a factor $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log\log n})$ of
the optimal LZ77 encoding, where $n$ is the length of the processed string. We
describe a series of examples showing that, surprisingly, this bound is tight,
thus improving both the previously known upper and lower bounds. Further, we
obtain a more detailed bound $O(\min\{z, \frac{\log n}{\log\log z}\})$, which
uses the number $z$ of phrases in the greedy LZ77 encoding as a parameter, and
construct a series of examples showing that this bound is tight even for binary
alphabet. We then investigate the problem on non-constant alphabets: we show
that the known $O(\log n)$ bound is tight even for alphabets of logarithmic
size, and provide tight bounds for some other important cases."
