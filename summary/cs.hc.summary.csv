summary
"The electronic presentation of text in small display windows is mushrooming.
In the present paper, four ways of presenting text in a small display window
were examined and compared to a Normal Page condition: rapid serial visual
presentation (RSVP), RSVP with a Completion Meter, Sentence-by-Sentence
presentation, and Sentence-by-Sentence presentation with a Completion Meter.
Dependent measures were reading efficiency - speed and comprehension - and
preference. For designers of hardware or software with small display windows,
the results suggest the following: (1) Though RSVP is disliked by readers, the
present methods of allowing self-pacing and regressions in RSVP, unlike earlier
tested methods, are efficient and feasible. (2) Slower reading in RSVP should
be achieved by increasing pauses between sentences or by repeating sentences,
not by decreasing the within-sentence rate. (3) Completion meters do not
interfere with performance, and are usually preferred. (4) The space-saving
Sentence-by-Sentence format is as efficient and as preferred as the Normal Page
format."
"Training in motor skills such as athletics, dance, or gymnastics is not
possible today except in the direct presence of the coach/instructor. This
paper describes a computer vision based gesture recognition system which is
used to metamorphose the user into a Virtual person, e.g. as a Kathakali
dancer, which is graphically recreated at a near or diatant location. Thus this
can be seen by an off-site coach using low-bandwidth joint-motion data which
permits real time animation. The metamorphosis involves altering the appearance
and identity of the user and also creating a specific environment possibly in
interaction with other virtual creatures.
  A robust vision module is used to identify the user, based on very simple
binary image processing in real time which also manages to resolve
self-occlusion, correct for clothing/colour and other variations among users.
Gestures are identified by locating key points at the shoulder, elbow and wrist
joint, which are then recreated in an articulated humanoid model, which in this
instance, representes a Kathakali dancer in elaborate traditional dress. Unlike
glove based or other and movement tracking systems, this application requires
the user to wear no hardwire devices and is aimed at making gesture tracking
simpler, cheaper, and more user friendly."
"The paper presents an introductory overview of the workflow automation area,
outlining the main types, basic technologies, the essential features of
workflow applications. Two sorts of process models for the definition of
workflows (according to the conversation-based and activity-based
methodologies) are sketched. Later on, the nature of Lotus Notes and its
capabilities (as an environment for workflow management systems development)
are indicated. Concluding, the experience of automating administrative
workflows (developing a Subsystem of Inter-institutional Document Management of
the VADIS project) is briefly outlined."
"We describe tap tips, a technique for providing touch-screen target location
hints. Tap tips are lightweight in that they are non-modal, appear only when
needed, require a minimal number of user gestures, and do not add to the
standard touchscreen gesture vocabulary. We discuss our implementation of tap
tips in an electronic guidebook system and some usability test results."
"In this paper, we describe an electronic guidebook prototype and report on a
study of its use in a historic house. Supported by mechanisms in the guidebook,
visitors constructed experiences that had a high degree of interaction with
three entities: the guidebook, their companions, and the house and its
contents. For example, we found that most visitors played audio descriptions
played through speakers (rather than using headphones or reading textual
descriptions) to facilitate communication with their companions."
"This paper explains four things in a unified way. First, how e-commerce can
generate price equilibria where physical shops either compete with virtual
shops for consumers with Internet access, or alternatively, sell only to
consumers with no Internet access. Second, how these price equilibria might
involve price dispersion on-line. Third, why prices may be higher on-line.
Fourth, why established firms can, but need not, be more reluctant than newly
created firm to adopt e-commerce. For this purpose we develop a model where
e-commerce reduces consumers' search costs, involves trade-offs for consumers,
and reduces retailing costs."
"There has been a widespread emergence of computing devices in the past few
years that go beyond the capabilities of traditional desktop computers.
However, users want to use the same kinds of applications and access the same
data and information on these appliances that they can access on their desktop
computers. The user interfaces for these platforms go beyond the traditional
interaction metaphors. It is a challenge to build User Interfaces (UIs) for
these devices of differing capabilities that allow the end users to perform the
same kinds of tasks. The User Interface Markup Language (UIML) is an XML-based
language that allows the canonical description of UIs for different platforms.
We describe the language features of UIML that facilitate the development of
multi-platform UIs. We also describe the key aspects of our approach that makes
UIML succeed where previous approaches failed, namely the division in the
representation of a UI, the use of a generic vocabulary, and an integrated
development environment specifically designed for transformation-based UI
development. Finally we describe the initial details of a multi-step usability
engineering process for building multi-platform UI using UIML."
"There has been a widespread emergence of computing devices in the past few

framework for building Multi-Platform User Interfaces using UIML. We describe
the language features of UIML that facilitate the development of multi-platform
UIs, the multi-step process involved in our framework and the transformations
needed to build the UIs."
"We describe an electronic guidebook, Sotto Voce, that enables visitors to
share audio information by eavesdropping on each other's guidebook activity. We
have conducted three studies of visitors using electronic guidebooks in a
historic house: one study with open air audio played through speakers and two
studies with eavesdropped audio. An analysis of visitor interaction in these
studies suggests that eavesdropped audio provides more social and interactive
learning resources than open air audio played through speakers."
"We present a case study of an iterative design process that includes a
conversation analyst. We discuss potential benefits of conversation analysis
for design, and we describe our strategies for integrating the conversation
analyst in the design process. Since the analyst on our team had no previous
exposure to design or engineering, and none of the other members of our team
had any experience with conversation analysis, we needed to build a foundation
for our interaction. One of our key strategies was to pair the conversation
analyst with a designer in a highly interactive collaboration. Our tactics have
been effective on our project, leading to valuable results that we believe we
could not have obtained using another method. We hope that this paper can serve
as a practical guide to those interested in establishing a productive and
efficient working relationship between a conversation analyst and the other
members of a design team."
"The Sonix is the main control software for the IBR-2 instruments. This is a
modular configurable and flexible system created using the Varman (real time
database) and the X11/OS9 graphical package in the OS-9 environment. In the
last few years we were mostly focused on making this system more reliable and
user friendly. Because the VME hardware and software upgrade is rather
expensive we would like to replace existing VME + OS9 control computers with
the PC+Windows XP ones in the future. This could be done with the help of
VME-PCI adapters."
"Web pages contain a large variety of information, but are largely designed
for use by graphical web browsers. Mobile access to web-based information often
requires presenting HTML web pages using channels that are limited in their
graphical capabilities such as small-screens or audio-only interfaces. Content
transcoding and annotations have been explored as methods for intelligently
presenting HTML documents. Much of this work has focused on transcoding for
small-screen devices such as are found on PDAs and cell phones. Here, we focus
on the use of annotations and transcoding for presenting HTML content through a
voice user interface instantiated in VoiceXML. This transcoded voice interface
is designed with an assumption that it will not be used for extended web
browsing by voice, but rather to quickly gain directed access to information on
web pages. We have found repeated structures that are common in the
presentation of data on web pages that are well suited for voice presentation
and navigation. In this paper, we describe these structures and their use in an
annotation system we have implemented that produces a VoiceXML interface to
information originally embedded in HTML documents. We describe the transcoding
process used to translate HTML into VoiceXML, including transcoding features we
have designed to lead to highly usable VoiceXML code."
"Unfamiliar, large-scale virtual environments are difficult to navigate. This
paper presents design guidelines to ease navigation in such virtual
environments. The guidelines presented here focus on the design and placement
of landmarks in virtual environments. Moreover, the guidelines are based
primarily on the extensive empirical literature on navigation in the real
world. A rationale for this approach is provided by the similarities between
navigational behavior in real and virtual environments."
"The Ubiquitous Interactor (UBI) addresses the problems of design and
development that arise around services that need to be accessed from many
different devices. In UBI, the same service can present itself with different
user interfaces on different devices. This is done by separating interaction
between users and services from presentation. The interaction is kept the same
for all devices, and different presentation information is provided for
different devices. This way, tailored user interfaces for many different
devices can be created without multiplying development and maintenance work. In
this paper we describe the system design of UBI, the system implementation, and
two services implemented for the system: a calendar service and a stockbroker
service."
"This paper presents an exploratory study of college-age students using
two-way, push-to-talk cellular radios. We describe the observed and reported
use of cellular radio by the participants, the activities and purposes for
which they adopted it, and their responses. We then examine these empirical
results using mediated communication theory. Cellular radios have a unique
combination of affordances relative to other media used by this age group,
including instant messaging (IM) and mobile phones; the results of our analysis
do suggest explanations for some observed phenomena but also highlight the
counter-intuitive nature of other phenomena. For example, although the radios
have many important dissimilarities with IM from the viewpoint of mediated
communication theory, the observed use patterns resembled those of IM to a
surprising degree."
"This paper presents an exploratory study of college-age students using
two-way, push-to-talk cellular radios. We describe the observed and reported
use of cellular radio by the participants. We discuss how the half-duplex,
lightweight cellular radio communication was associated with reduced
interactional commitment, which meant the cellular radios could be used for a
wide range of conversation styles. One such style, intermittent conversation,
is characterized by response delays. Intermittent conversation is surprising in
an audio medium, since it is typically associated with textual media such as
instant messaging. We present design implications of our findings."
"This paper describes some preliminary results from a 20-week study on the use
of Compaq iPAQ Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) by 10 senior developers,
analysts, technical managers, and senior organisational managers. The goal of
the study was to identify what applications were used, how and where they were
used, the problems and issues that arose, and how use of the iPAQs changed over
the study period. The paper highlights some interesting uses of the iPAQs, and
identifies some of the characteristics of successful mobile applications."
"In this position paper we propose a process model that provides a development
infrastructure in which the usability engineering and software engineering life
cycles co-exist in complementary roles. We describe the motivation, hurdles,
rationale, arguments, and implementation plan for the need, specification, and
the usefulness of such a model."
"Generative Programming (GP) is a computing paradigm allowing automatic
creation of entire software families utilizing the configuration of elementary
and reusable components. GP can be projected on different technologies, e.g.
C++-templates, Java-Beans, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), or Frame
technology. This paper focuses on Frame Technology, which aids the possible
implementation and completion of software components. The purpose of this paper
is to introduce the GP paradigm in the area of GUI application generation. It
demonstrates how automatically customized executable applications with GUI
parts can be generated from an abstract specification."
"In current presence or availability systems, the method of presenting a
user's state often supposes an instantaneous notion of that state - for
example, a visualization is rendered or an inference is made about the
potential actions that might be consistent with a user's state. Drawing on
observational research on the use of existing communication technology, we
argue (as have others in the past) that determination of availability is often
a joint process, and often one that takes the form of a negotiation (whether
implicit or explicit). We briefly describe our current research on applying
machine learning to infer degrees of conversational engagement from observed
conversational behavior. Such inferences can be applied to facilitate the
implicit negotiation of conversational engagement - in effect, helping users to
weave together the act of contact with the act of determining availability."
"We provide two case studies in the application of ideas drawn from
conversation analysis to the design of technologies that enhance the experience
of human conversation. We first present a case study of the design of an
electronic guidebook, focusing on how conversation analytic principles played a
role in the design process. We then discuss how the guidebook project has
inspired our continuing work in social, mobile audio spaces. In particular, we
describe some as yet unrealized concepts for adaptive audio spaces."
"A Survey of the principal literature on Human Centred Design reveals the four
most referenced principles. These are discussed with reference to the
application of a particular website, and a user survey is constructed based
upon the four principles."
"As computers become more ubiquitous, traditional two-dimensional interfaces
must be replaced with interfaces based on a three-dimensional metaphor.
However, these interfaces must still be as simple and functional as their
two-dimensional predecessors. This paper introduces SWiM, a new interface for
moving application windows between various screens, such as wall displays,
laptop monitors, and desktop displays, in a three-dimensional physical
environment. SWiM was designed based on the results of initial ""paper and
pencil"" user tests of three possible interfaces. The results of these tests led
to a map-like interface where users select the destination display for their
application from various icons. If the destination is a mobile display it is
not displayed on the map. Instead users can select the screen's name from a
list of all possible destination displays. User testing of SWiM was conducted
to discover whether it is easy to learn and use. Users that were asked to use
SWiM without any instructions found the interface as intuitive to use as users
who were given a demonstration. The results show that SWiM combines simplicity
and functionality to create an interface that is easy to learn and easy to use."
"Pervasive personal communication technologies offer the potential for
important social benefits for individual users, but also the potential for
significant social difficulties and costs. In research on face-to-face social
interaction, ambiguity is often identified as an important resource for
resolving social difficulties. In this paper, we discuss two design cases of
personal communication systems, one based on fieldwork of a commercial system
and another based on an unrealized design concept. The cases illustrate how
user behavior concerning a particular social difficulty, unexplained
unresponsiveness, can be influenced by technological issues that result in
interactional ambiguity. The cases also highlight the need to balance the
utility of ambiguity against the utility of usability and communicative
clarity."
"Input method (IM) is a sine qua non for text entry of many Asian languages,
but its potential applications on other languages remain under-explored. This
paper proposes a philosophy of input method design by seeing it as a
nonintrusive plug-in text service framework. Such design allows new
functionalities of text processing to be attached onto a running application
without any tweaking of code. We also introduce OpenVanilla, a cross-platform
framework that is designed with the above-mentioned model in mind. Frameworks
like OpenVanilla have shown that an input method can be more than just a text
entry tool: it offers a convenient way for developing various text service and
language tools."

"We introduce a novel approach to control physical lighting parameters by
means of a pressure-sensitive touchpad. The two-dimensional area of the
touchpad is subdivided into 5 virtual sliders, each controlling the intensity
of a color (red, green, blue, yellow, and white). The physical interaction
methodology is modeled directly after ubiquitous mechanical sliders and dimmers
which tend to be used for intensity/volume control. Our abstraction to a
pressure-sensitive touchpad provides advantages and introduces additional
benefits over such existing devices."
"Most research on 3D user interfaces aims at providing only a single sensory
modality. One challenge is to integrate several sensory modalities into a
seamless system while preserving each modality's immersion and performance
factors. This paper concerns manipulation tasks and proposes a visuo-haptic
system integrating immersive visualization, tactile force and tactile feedback
with co-location. An industrial application is presented."
"Under consideration are the general set of Human computer Interaction (HCI)
and Educational principles from prominent authors in the field and the
construction of a system for evaluating Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs)
with respect to the application of these HCI and Educational Principles. A
frequency analysis of principles is used to obtain the most significant set.
Metrics are devised to provide objective measures of these principles and a
consistent testing regime is introduced. These principles are used to analyse
the University VLE Blackboard. An open source VLE is also constructed with
similar content to Blackboard courses so that a systematic comparison can be
made. HCI and Educational metrics are determined for each VLE."
"In this report, we describe the work done in a project that explored the
human information processing aspects of a personal memex (a memex to organize
personal information). In the project, we considered the use of the personal
memex, focusing on information recall, by three populations: people with Mild
Cognitive Impairment, those diagnosed with Macular Degeneration, and a
high-functioning population. The outcomes of the project included human
information processing-centered design guidelines for the memex interface, a
low-fidelity prototype, and an annotated bibliography for human information
processing, usability and design literature relating to the memex and the
populations we explored."
"This paper presents our evaluation of using a Tablet-PC to provide
peer-review comments in the first year Computer Science course. Our exploration
consisted of an evaluation of how students write comments on other students'
assignments using three different methods: pen and paper, a Tablet-PC, and a
desktop computer. Our ultimate goal is to explore the effect that interface
style (Tablet vs. Desktop) has on the quality and quantity of the comments
provided."
"Spontaneous multi-party interaction - conversation among groups of three or
more participants - is part of daily life. While automated modeling of such
interactions has received increased attention in ubiquitous computing research,
there is little applied research on the organization of this highly dynamic and
spontaneous sociable interaction within small groups. We report here on an
applied conversation analytic study of small-group sociable talk, emphasizing
structural and temporal aspects that can inform computational models. In
particular, we examine the mechanics of multiple simultaneous conversational
floors - how participants initiate a new floor amidst an on-going floor, and
how they subsequently show their affiliation with one floor over another. We
also discuss the implications of these findings for the design of ""smart""
multi-party applications."
"This paper focuses on two characteristics of collaborative design with
respect to cooperative work: the importance of work interdependencies linked to
the nature of design problems; and the fundamental function of design
cooperative work arrangement which is the confrontation and combination of
perspectives. These two intrinsic characteristics of the design work stress
specific cooperative processes: coordination processes in order to manage task
interdependencies, establishment of common ground and negotiation mechanisms in
order to manage the integration of multiple perspectives in design."
"We present a field study aimed at analysing the use of viewpoints in
co-design meetings. A viewpoint is a representation characterised by a certain
combination of constraints. Three types of viewpoints are distinguished:
prescribed viewpoint, discipline-specific viewpoint and integrated viewpoint.
The contribution of our work consists in characterising the viewpoints of
various stakeholders involved in co-design (""design office"" disciplines, and
production and maintenance disciplines), the dynamics of viewpoints
confrontation and the cooperative modes that enable these different viewpoints
to be integrated."
"By contrast to design meetings, design evaluation meetings (DEMs) have
generally been considered as situations in which, according to DEMs
methodologies, design activities are quite marginal. In a study of DEMs in
software development, i.e. in technical review meetings following a particular
review methodology, we showed: (i) the occurrence of design activities as part
of an argumentation process; (ii) the relative importance of cognitive
synchronisation as a prerequisite for evaluation; (iii) the important role
played in evaluation by argumentation that makes explicit the underlying design
rationale (DR). On the basis of our results, we discuss the potential for using
DR methodologies in this kind of meetings."
"This paper presents a state-of-art review of empirical research on
object-oriented (OO) design. Many claims about the cognitive benefits of the OO
paradigm have been made by its advocates. These claims concern the ease of
designing and reusing software at the individual level as well as the benefits
of this paradigm at the team level. Since these claims are cognitive in nature,
its seems important to assess them empirically. After a brief presentation of
the main concepts of the OO paradigm, the claims about the superiority of OO
design are outlined. The core of this paper consists of a review of empirical
studies of OOD. We first discuss results concerning OOD by individuals. On the
basis of empirical work, we (1) analyse the design activity of novice OO
designers, (2) compare OO design with procedural design and, (3) discuss a
typology of problems relevant for the OO approach. Then we assess the claims
about naturalness and ease of OO design. The next part discusses results on OO
software reuse. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) compare reuse in the OO
versus procedural paradigm, (2) discuss the potential for OO software reuse and
(3) analyse reuse activity in the OO paradigm. Then we assess claims on
reusability. The final part reviews empirical work on OO design by teams. We
present results on communication, coordination, knowledge dissemination and
interactions with clients. Then we assess claims about OOD at the software
design team level. In a general conclusion, we discuss the limitations of these
studies and give some directions for future research."
"In this paper, we propose an analytical framework that aims to bring out the
nature of participants' contributions to co-design meetings, in a way that
synthesises content and function dimensions, together with the dimension of
dialogicality. We term the resulting global vision of contribution, the
""interactive profile""."
"Empirical software engineering is concerned with measuring, or estimating,
both the effort put into the software process and the quality of its product.
We defend the idea that measuring process effort and product quality and
establishing a relation between the two cannot be performed without a model of
cognitive and collective activities involved in software design, and without
measurement of these activities. This is the object of our field, i.e.
Cognitive Ergonomics of design. After a brief presentation of its theoretical
and methodological foundations, we will discuss a cognitive approach to design
activities and its potential to provide new directions in ESE. Then we will
present and discuss an illustration of the methodological directions we have
proposed for the analysis and measurement of cognitive activities in the
context of collective software design. The two situations analysed are
technical review meetings, and Request For Comments-like procedures in Open
Source Software design."
"The goal of our study is to evaluate the effect on program comprehension of
three factors that have not previously been studied in a single experiment.
These factors are programmer expertise (expert vs. novice), programming task
(documentation vs. reuse), and the development of understanding over time
(phase 1 vs. phase 2). This study is carried out in the context of the mental
model approach to comprehension based on van Dijk and Kintsch's model (1983).
One key aspect of this model is the distinction between two kinds of
representation the reader might construct from a text: 1) the textbase, which
refers to what is said in the text and how it is said, and 2) the situation
model, which represents the situation referred to by the text. We have
evaluated the effect of the three factors mentioned above on the development of
both the textbase (or program model) and the situation model in object-oriented
program comprehension. We found a four-way interaction of expertise, phase,
task and type of model. For the documentation group we found that experts and
novices differ in the elaboration of their situation model but not their
program model. There was no interaction of expertise with phase and type of
model in the documentation group. For the reuse group, there was a three-way
interaction between phase, expertise and type of model. For the novice reuse
group, the effect of the phase was to increase the construction of the
situation model but not the program model. With respect to the task, our
results show that novices do not spontaneously construct a strong situation
model but are able to do so if the task demands it."
"Peer review meetings (PRMs) are formal meetings during which peers
systematically analyze artifacts to improve their quality and report on
non-conformities. This paper presents an approach based on protocol analysis
for quantifying the influence of participant roles during PRMs. Three views are
used to characterize the seven defined participant roles. The project view
defines three roles supervisor, procedure expert and developer. The meeting
view defines two roles: author and reviewer, and the task view defines the
roles reflecting direct and indirect interest in the artifact under review. The
analysis, based on log-linear modeling, shows that review activities have
different patterns, depending on their focus: form or content. The influence of
each role is analyzed with respect to this focus. Interpretation of the
quantitative data leads to the suggestion that PRMs could be improved by
creating three different types of reviews, each of which collects together
specific roles: form review, cognitive synchronization review and content
review."
"An observational study was conducted on a professional designer working on a
design project in aerospace industry. The protocol data were analyzed in order
to gain insight into the actions the designer used for the development of a
solution to the corresponding problem. Different processes are described: from
the ""simple"" evocation of a solution existing in memory, to the elaboration of
a ""new"" solution out of mnesic entities without any clear link to the current
problem. Control is addressed in so far as it concerns the priority among the
different types of development processes: the progression from evocation of a
""standard"" solution to elaboration of a ""new"" solution is supposed to
correspond to the resulting order, that is, the one in which the designer's
activity proceeds. Short discussions of * the double status of ""problem"" and
""solution,"" * the problem/solution knowledge units in memory and their access,
and * the different abstraction levels on which problem and solution
representations are developed, are illustrated by the results."
"An empirical study was conducted to analyse design strategies and knowledge
used in object-oriented software design. Eight professional programmers
experienced with procedural programming languages and either experienced or not
experienced in object-oriented design strategies related to two central aspects
of the object-oriented paradigm: (1) associating actions, i.e., execution
steps, of a complex plan to different objects and revising a complex plan, and
(2) defining simple plans at different levels in the class hierarchy. As
regards the development of complex plans elements attached to different
objects, our results show that, for beginners in OOP, the description of
objects and the description of actions are not always integrated in an early
design phase, particularly for the declarative problem whereas, for the
programmers experienced in OOP, the description of objects and the description
of actions tend to be integrated in their first drafts of solutions whichever
the problem type. The analysis of design strategies reveal the use of different
knowledge according to subjects' language experience: (1) schemas related to
procedural languages; actions are organized in an execution order, or (2)
schemas related to object-oriented languages; actions and objects are
integrated, and actions are organised around objects."
"The objective of this research is to analyse the ways members of open-source
software communities participate in design. In particular we focus on how users
of an Open Source (OS) programming language (Python) participate in adding new
functionalities to the language. Indeed, in the OS communities, users are
highly skilled in computer sciences; they do not correspond to the common
representation of end-users and can potentially participate to the design
process. Our study characterizes the Python galaxy and analyses a formal
process to introduce new functionalities to the language called Python
Enhancement Proposal (PEP) from the idea of language evolution to the PEP
implementation. The analysis of a particular pushed-by-users PEP from one
application domain community (financial), shows: that the design process is
distributed and specialized between online and physical interactions spaces;
and there are some cross participants between users and developers communities
which may reveal boundary spanners roles."
"This study is focused on the role of external representations, e.g.,
skteches, in collaborative architectural design. In particular, we analyse (1)
the use of graphico-gestural modalities and, (2) the articulation modes between
graphico-gestural and verbal modalities in design interaction. We have
elaborated a first classification which distinguishes between two modes of
articulation, articulation in integrated activities versus articulation in
parallel activities."
"Empirical studies on design have emphasised the role of memory of past
solutions. Design involves the use of generic knowledge as well as episodic
knowledge about past designs for analogous problems : in this way, it involves
the reuse of past designs. We analyse this mechanism of reuse from a
socio-cognitive viewpoint. According to a purely cognitive approach, reuse
involves cognitive mechanisms linked to the problem solving activity itself.
Our socio-cognitive approach accounts for these phenomena as well as reuse
mechanisms linked to cooperation, in particular coordination, and
confrontation/integration of viewpoints."
"We present an empirical study aimed at analysing the use of viewpoints in an
industrial Concurrent Engineering context. Our focus is on the viewpoints
expressed in the argumentative process taking place in evaluation meetings. Our
results show that arguments enabling a viewpoint or proposal to be defended are
often characterized by the use of constraints. One result involved the way in
which the proposals for solutions are assessed during these meetings. We have
revealed the existence of specific assessment modes in these meetings as well
as their combination. Then, we show that, even if some constraints are
apparently identically used by the different specialists involved in meetings,
various meanings and weightings are associated with these constraints by these
different specialists."
"Previous studies on program comprehension were carried out largely in the
context of procedural languages. Our purpose is to develop and evaluate a
cognitive model of object-oriented (OO) program understanding. Our model is
based on the van Dijk and Kintsch's model of text understanding (1983). One key
aspect of this theoretical approach is the distinction between two kinds of
representation the reader might construct from a text: the textbase and the
situation model. On the basis of results of an experiment we have conducted, we
evaluate the cognitive validity of this distinction in OO program
understanding. We examine how the construction of these two representations is
differentially affected by the programmer's expertise and how they evolve
differentially over time."
"This paper presents an analysis of various forms of articulation between
graphico-gestural and verbal modalities in parallel interactions between
designers in a collaborative design situation. Based on our methodological
framework, we illustrate several forms of multimodal articulations, that is,
integrated and non-integrated, through extracts from a corpus on an
architectural design meeting. These modes reveal alignment or disalignment
between designers, with respect to the focus of their activities. They also
show different forms of coalition."
"This paper defends an augmented cognitively oriented ""generic-design
hypothesis"": There are both significant similarities between the design
activities implemented in different situations and crucial differences between
these and other cognitive activities; yet, characteristics of a design
situation (i.e., related to the designers, the artefact, and other task
variables influencing these two) introduce specificities in the corresponding
design activities and cognitive structures that are used. We thus combine the
generic-design hypothesis with that of different ""forms"" of designing. In this
paper, outlining a number of directions that need further elaboration, we
propose a series of candidate dimensions underlying such forms of design."
"This paper presents a cognitive typology of reuse processes, and a cognitive
typology of documenting processes. Empirical studies on design with reuse and
on software documenting provide evidence for a generalized cognitive model.
First, these studies emphasize the cyclical nature of design: cycles of
planning, writing and revising occur. Second, natural language documentation
follows the hierarchy of cognitive entities manipulated during design.
Similarly software reuse involves exploiting various types of knowledge
depending on the phase of design in which reuse is involved. We suggest that
these observations can be explained based on cognitive models of text
processing: the van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) model of text comprehension, and
the Hayes and Flower (1980) model of text production. Based on our generalized
cognitive model, we suggest a framework for documenting reusable components."
"Today, people use multiple devices to fulfill their information needs.
However, designers design each device individually, without accounting for the
other devices that users may also use. In many cases, the applications on all
these devices are designed to be functional replicates of each other. We argue
that this results in an over-reliance on data synchronization across devices,
version control nightmares, and increased burden of file management. In this
paper, we present the idea of a \textit{personal information ecosystem}, an
analogy to biological ecosystems, which allows us to discuss the
inter-relationships among these devices to fulfill the information needs of the
user. There is a need for designers to design devices as part of a complete
ecosystem, not as independent devices that simply share data replicated across
them. To help us understand this domain and to facilitate the dialogue and
study of such systems, we present the terminology, classifications of the
interdependencies among different devices, and resulting implications for
design."
"A number of papers have been reviewed in the areas of HCI, CSCW, CSCL. These
have been analyzed with a view to extract the ideas relevant to a consideration
of user interactions in a collaborative on line laboratory which is being under
development for use in the ITO BSc course at Southampton University. The
construction of new theoretical models is to be based upon principles of
collaborative HCI design and constructivist and situational educational theory.
An investigation of the review papers it is hoped will lead towards a
methodology/framework that can be used as guidance for collaborative learning
systems and these will need to be developed alongside the requirements as they
change during the development cycles. The primary outcome will be the analysis
and re-design of the online e-learning laboratory together with a measure of
its efficacy in the learning process."
"In our society, people with motor impairments are oftentimes socially
excluded from their environment. This is unfortunate because every human being
should have the possibility to obtain the necessary conditions to live a normal
life. Although there is technology to assist people with motor impairments, few
systems are targeted for programming environments. We have created a system,
called Logo Keyboard, to assist people with motor disabilities to program with
the Logo programming language. With this special keyboard we can help more
people to get involved into computer programming and to develop projects in
different areas."
"This paper presents an approach to the study of cognitive activities in
collaborative software development. This approach has been developed by a
multidisciplinary team made up of software engineers and cognitive
psychologists. The basis of this approach is to improve our understanding of
software development by observing professionals at work. The goal is to derive
lines of conduct or good practices based on observations and analyses of the
processes that are naturally used by software engineers. The strategy involved
is derived from a standard approach in cognitive science. It is based on the
videotaping of the activities of software engineers, transcription of the
videos, coding of the transcription, defining categories from the coded
episodes and defining cognitive behaviors or dialogs from the categories. This
project presents two original contributions that make this approach generic in
software engineering. The first contribution is the introduction of a formal
hierarchical coding scheme, which will enable comparison of various types of
observations. The second is the merging of psychological and statistical
analysis approaches to build a cognitive model. The details of this new
approach are illustrated with the initial data obtained from the analysis of
technical review meetings."
"This study analyzes object-oriented (OO) program comprehension by experts and
novices. We examine the effect of expertise in three dimensions of
comprehension strategies: the scope of the comprehension, the top-down versus
bottom-up direction of the processes, and the guidance of the comprehension
activity. Overall, subjects were similar in the scope of their comprehension,
although the experts tended to consult more files. We found strong evidence of
top-down, inference-driven behaviors, as well as multiple guidance in expert
comprehension. We also found evidence of execution-based guidance and less use
of top-down processes in novice comprehension. Guidance by inheritance and
composition relationships in the OO program was not dominant, but nevertheless
played a substantial role in expert program comprehension. However, these
static relationships more closely tied to the OO nature of the program were
exploited poorly by novices. To conclude, these results are discussed with
respect to the literature on procedural program comprehension."
"The topic of this chapter is the role of expert programming knowledge in the
understanding activity. In the ""schema-based approach"", the role of semantic
structures is emphasized whereas, in the ""control-flow approach"", the role of
syntactic structures is emphasized. Data which support schema-based models of
understanding are presented. Data which are more consistent with the
""control-flow approach"" allow to discuss the limits of the former kind of
models."
"The first objective of this paper is to present and discuss various types of
models of program understanding. They are discussed in relation to models of
text understanding. The second objective of this paper is to assess the effect
of purpose for reading, or more specifically programming task, on the cognitive
processes involved and representations constructed in program understanding.
This is done in the theoretical framework of van Dijk and Kintsch's model of
text understanding (1983)."
"This paper presents an empirical study of the software reuse activity by
expert designers in the context of object-oriented design. Our study focuses on
the three following aspects of reuse : (1) the interaction between some design
processes, e.g. constructing a problem representation, searching for and
evaluating solutions, and reuse processes, i.e. retrieving and using previous
solutions, (2) the mental processes involved in reuse, e.g. example-based
retrieval or bottom-up versus top-down expanding of the solution, and (3) the
mental representations constructed throughout the reuse activity, e.g. dynamic
versus static representations. Some implications of these results for the
specification of software reuse support environments are discussed."
"In Concurrent engineering, design solutions are not only produced by
individuals specialized in a given field. Due to the team nature of the design
activity, solutions are negotiated. Our objective is to analyse the
argumentation processes leading to these negotiated solutions. These processes
take place in the meetings which group together specialists with a co-design
aim. We conducted cognitive ergonomics research work during the definition
phase of an aeronautical design project in which the participants work in
Concurrent Engineering. We recorded, retranscribed and analysed 7
multi-speciality meetings. These meetings were organised, as needed, to assess
the integration of the solutions of each speciality into a global solution. We
found that there are three main design proposal assessment modes which can be
combined in these meetings: (a) analytical assessment mode, (b) comparative
assessment mode (c) analogical assessment mode. Within these assessment modes,
different types of arguments are used. Furthermore we found a typical temporal
negotiation process."
"This paper presents a study aiming to analyse the design strategies of
experts in object-oriented programming. We report an experiment conducted with
four experts. Each subject solved three problems. Our results show that three
strategies may be used in program design according to the solution structure.
An object-centred strategy and a function-centred strategy are used when the
solution has a hierarchical structure with vertical communication between
objects. In this case, the plan which guides the design activity is
declarative. A procedure-centred strategy is used when the solution has a flat
structure with horizontal communication between objects. In this case, the plan
which guides the design activity is procedural. These results are discussed in
relation with results on design strategies in procedural design. Furthermore,
our results provide insight into the knowledge structures of experts in
object-oriented design. To conclude, we point out limitations of this study and
discuss implications of our results for Human-Computer Interaction systems, in
particular for systems assisting experts in their design activity."
"Open Source Software (OSS) development challenges traditional software
engineering practices. In particular, OSS projects are managed by a large
number of volunteers, working freely on the tasks they choose to undertake. OSS
projects also rarely rely on explicit system-level design, or on project plans
or schedules. Moreover, OSS developers work in arbitrary locations and
collaborate almost exclusively over the Internet, using simple tools such as
email and software code tracking databases (e.g. CVS). All the characteristics
above make OSS development akin to weaving a tapestry of heterogeneous
components. The OSS design process relies on various types of actors: people
with prescribed roles, but also elements coming from a variety of information
spaces (such as email and software code). The objective of our research is to
understand the specific hybrid weaving accomplished by the actors of this
distributed, collective design process. This, in turn, challenges traditional
methodologies used to understand distributed software engineering: OSS
development is simply too ""fibrous"" to lend itself well to analysis under a
single methodological lens. In this paper, we describe the methodological
framework we articulated to analyze collaborative design in the Open Source
world. Our framework focuses on the links between the heterogeneous components
of a project's hybrid network. We combine ethnography, text mining, and
socio-technical network analysis and visualization to understand OSS
development in its totality. This way, we are able to simultaneously consider
the social, technical, and cognitive aspects of OSS development. We describe
our methodology in detail, and discuss its implications for future research on
distributed collective practices."
"Screen readers can drive braille devices for allowing visually impaired users
to access computer environments, by providing them the same information as
sighted users. But in some cases, this view is not easy to use on a braille
device. In such cases, it would be much more useful to let applications provide
their own braille feedback, specially adapted to visually impaired users. Such
applications would then need the ability to output braille ; however, allowing
both screen readers and applications access a wide panel of braille devices is
not a trivial task. We present an abstraction layer that applications may use
to communicate with braille devices. They do not need to deal with the
specificities of each device, but can do so if necessary. We show how several
applications can communicate with one braille device concurrently, with BrlAPI
making sensible choices about which application eventually gets access to the
device. The description of a widely used implementation of BrlAPI is included."
"Tremendous research effort was invested in audio browsers and machine
learning techniques to decode the structure of Web pages in order to put them
into an audio format. In this paper, we address a simpler and efficient
solution for the creation of an audio browser of VOICEXML generated from
RSS/Atom stream feeds. We developed a multimodal (audio and graphical) portal
application that offers RSS/Atom feeds. By utilizing sing our system, the user
can interact using voice or graphic commands, listen and watch digital content,
such as news, blogs feeds, podcasts, and even access email and personal
schedules. The portal system permits the use of security credentials
(user/password authentication) to collect secure RSS/Atom stream in the
multimodal browser to connect the user to specific personal services. A series
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RSS reader
and navigator. Our system is extremely beneficial for a wide range of
applications, from interfaces for the visual impaired users to browsers for
mobile telephonic interfaces."
"The main goal of this project is to research technical advances in order to
enhance the possibility to develop narratives within immersive mediated
environments. An important part of the research is concerned with the question
of how a script can be written, annotated and realized for an immersive
context. A first description of the main theoretical framework and the ongoing
work and a first script example is provided. This project is part of the
program for presence research, and it will exploit physiological feedback and
Computational Intelligence within virtual reality."
"We present a qualitative study of 20 American Orthodox Jewish families' use
of home automation for religious purposes. These lead users offer insight into
real-life, long-term experience with home automation technologies. We discuss
how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience
and how participants oriented to the use of automation as a religious custom.
We also discuss the relationship of home automation to family life. We draw
design implications for the broader population, including surrender of control
as a design resource, home technologies that support long-term goals and
lifestyle choices, and respite from technology."
"The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware
capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets
become available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not
satisfactorily answer the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global
structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities.
To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for
networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations:
node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while
arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better
support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction
techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging
selections from either a node-link or a matrix, flexibly manipulate the
NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset, and create meaningful summary
visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying
NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate
the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means
of communicating results."
"The new requirement for ""collaboration"" between multidisciplinary
collaborators induces to exchange and share adequate information on the
product, processes throughout the products' lifecycle. Thus, effective capture
of information, and also its extraction, recording, exchange, sharing, and
reuse become increasingly critical. These lead companies to adopt new improved
methodologies in managing the exchange and sharing of information. The aim of
this paper is to describe a collaborative framework system to exchange and
share information, which is based on: (i) The Product Process Collaboration
Organization model (PPCO) which defines product and process information, and
the various collaboration methods for the organizations involved in the supply
chain. (ii) Viewpoint model describes relationships between each actor and the
comprehensive Product/Process model, defining each actor's ""domain of interest""
within the evolving product definition. (iii) A layer which defines the
comprehensive organization and collaboration relationships between the actors
within the supply chain. (iv) Based on the above relationships, the last layer
proposes a typology of exchanged messages. A communication method, based on
XML, is developed that supports optimal exchange/sharing of information. To
illustrate the proposed framework system, an example is presented related to
collaborative design of a new piston for an automotive engine. The focus is on
user-viewpoint integration to ensure that the adequate information is retrieved
from the PPCO."
"Nowadays, to achieve competitive advantage, the industrial companies are
considering that success is sustained to great product development. That is to
manage the product throughout its entire lifecycle. Achieving this goal
requires a tight collaboration between actors from a wide variety of domains,
using different software tools producing various product data types and
formats. The actors' collaboration is mainly based on the exchange /share
product information. The representation of the actors' viewpoints is the
underlying requirement of the collaborative product development. The multiple
viewpoints approach was designed to provide an organizational framework
following the actors' perspectives in the collaboration, and their
relationships. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple
integration of product information as different views, promotes gathering of
actors' interest, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a
multiple viewpoints representation is proposed. The product, process,
organization information models are discussed. A series of issues referring to
the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail. Based on XML standard,
taking electrical connector as an example, an application case of part of
product information modeling is stated."
"The analysis of the practices and the tendencies of the users at the time of
the search for information on Internet makes it possible to highlight several
points. The search for information becomes powerful after knowledge of the
typology of the various systems of research. This typology supports the
adoption of a methodology of research which one can characterize by pull
systems, intelligent agents, etc. In addition, the importance of the structure
of the electronic document, correctly elaborated in advance, will support a
higher relevance ratio to find information. In our article, the problems turn
around the study of the behavior of the users in situation of search for
information, as well as the constitution of a pole of documentary resources
within a framework of an architectural project. It is noted that the evolution
of the documentary resources is related to information technologies."
"As product complexity and marketing competition increase, a collaborative
product development is necessary for companies which develop high quality
products in short lead-times. To support product actors from different fields,
disciplines, and locations, wishing to exchange and share information, the
representation of the actors' viewpoints is the underlying requirement of the
collaborative product development. The actors' viewpoints approach was designed
to provide an organisational framework following the actors' perspectives in
the collaboration, and their relationships, could be explicitly gathered and
formatted. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple integration
of product information as different views, promotes gathering of actors'
interests, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a
solution for neutral viewpoints representation is proposed. The product,
process, and organisation information models are seriatim discussed. A series
of issues referring to the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail.
Based on XML standard, taking cyclone vessel as an example, an application case
of part of product information modelling is stated."
"This paper presents an interaction model adapted to mixed reality
environments known as IRVO (Interacting with Real and Virtual Objects). IRVO
aims at modeling the interaction between one or more users and the Mixed
Reality system by representing explicitly the objects and tools involved and
their relationship. IRVO covers the design phase of the life cycle and models
the intended use of the system. In a first part, we present a brief review of
related HCI models. The second part is devoted to the IRVO model, its notation
and some examples. In the third part, we present how IRVO is used for designing
applications and in particular we show how this model can be integrated in a
Model-Based Approach (CoCSys) which is currently designed at our lab."
"The History of HCI is briefly reviewed together with three HCI models and
structure including CSCW, CSCL and CSCR. It is shown that a number of
authorities consider HCI to be a fragmented discipline with no agreed set of
unifying design principles. An analysis of usability criteria based upon
citation frequency of authors is performed in order to discover the eight most
recognised HCI principles."
"In a previous paper the CSCR domain was defined. Here this is taken to the
next stage where we consider the design of a particular Collaborative Research
Environment to support Students and Supervisors CRESS. Following the CSCR
structure a preliminary design for CRESS has been established and a portal
framework analysis is undertaken in order to determine the most appropriate set
of tools for its implementation."
"In a previous paper the CSCR domain was defined. Here this is taken to the
next stage where the design of a particular Collaborative Research Environment
to support Students and Supervisors (CRESS) is considered. Following the CSCR
structure this paper deals with an analysis of 13 collaborative working
environments to determine a preliminary design for CRESS in order to discover
the most appropriate set of tools for its implementation."
"This overview paper defends an augmented cognitively oriented generic-design
hypothesis: there are both significant similarities between the design
activities implemented in different situations and crucial differences between
these and other cognitive activities; yet, characteristics of a design
situation (related to the design process, the designers, and the artefact)
introduce specificities in the corresponding cognitive activities and
structures that are used, and in the resulting designs. We thus augment the
classical generic-design hypothesis with that of different forms of designing.
We review the data available in the cognitive design research literature and
propose a series of candidates underlying such forms of design, outlining a
number of directions requiring further elaboration."
"The paper presents a 3D interactive representation of fairly large picture
collections which facilitates browsing through unstructured sets of icons or
pictures. Implementation of this representation implies choosing between two
visualization strategies: users may either manipulate the view (OV) or be
immersed in it (IV). The paper first presents this representation, then
describes an empirical study (17 participants) aimed at assessing the utility
and usability of each view. Subjective judgements in questionnaires and
debriefings were varied: 7 participants preferred the IV view, 4 the OV one,
and 6 could not choose between the two. Visual acuity and visual exploration
strategies seem to have exerted a greater influence on participants'
preferences than task performance or feeling of immersion."
"We present our current research on the implementation of gaze as an efficient
and usable pointing modality supplementary to speech, for interacting with
augmented objects in our daily environment or large displays, especially
immersive virtual reality environments, such as reality centres and caves. We
are also addressing issues relating to the use of gaze as the main interaction
input modality. We have designed and developed two operational user interfaces:
one for providing motor-disabled users with easy gaze-based access to map
applications and graphical software; the other for iteratively testing and
improving the usability of gaze-contingent displays."
"The main aim of the work presented here is to contribute to computer science
advances in the multimodal usability area, in-as-much as it addresses one of
the major issues relating to the generation of effective oral system messages:
how to design messages which effectively help users to locate specific
graphical objects in information visualisations? An experimental study was
carried out to determine whether oral messages including coarse information on
the locations of graphical objects on the current display may facilitate target
detection tasks sufficiently for making it worth while to integrate such
messages in GUIs. The display spatial layout varied in order to test the
influence of visual presentation structure on the contribution of these
messages to facilitating visual search on crowded displays. Finally, three
levels of task difficulty were defined, based mainly on the target visual
complexity and the number of distractors in the scene. The findings suggest
that spatial information messages improve participants' visual search
performances significantly; they are more appropriate to radial structures than
to matrix, random and elleptic structures; and, they are particularly useful
for performing difficult visual search tasks."
"The paper tries to point out the benefits that can be derived from research
advances in the implementation of concepts such as ambient intelligence (AmI)
and ubiquitous or pervasive computing for promoting Universal Access (UA) to
the Information Society, that is, for contributing to enable everybody,
especially Physically Disabled (PD) people, to have easy access to all
computing resources and information services that the coming worldwide
Information Society will soon make available to the general public. Following
definitions of basic concepts relating to multimodal interaction, the
significant contribution of multimodality to developing UA is briefly argued.
Then, a short state of the art in AmI research is presented. In the last
section we bring out the potential contribution of advances in AmI research and
technology to the improvement of computer access for PD people. This claim is
supported by the following observations: (i) most projects aiming at
implementing AmI focus on the design of new interaction modalities and flexible
multimodal user interfaces which may facilitate PD users' computer access ;
(ii) targeted applications will support users in a wide range of daily
activities which will be performed simultaneously with supporting computing
tasks; therefore, users will be placed in contexts where they will be
confronted with similar difficulties to those encountered by PD users; (iii)
AmI applications being intended for the general public, a wide range of new
interaction devices and flexible processing software will be available, making
it possible to provide PD users with human-computer facilities tailored to
their specific needs at reasonable expense.."
"In order to evaluate the contribution of Embodied (Animated) Conversational
Agents (ECAs) to the effectiveness and usability of human-computer interaction,
we developed a software platform meant to collect usage data. This platform,
which implements the wizard of Oz paradigm, makes it possible to simulate user
interfaces integrating ACAs for any Windows software application. It can also
save and ""replay"" a rich interaction trace including user and system events,
screen captures, users' speech and eye fixations. This platform has been used
to assess users' subjective judgements and reactions to a multimodal online
help system meant to facilitate the use of software for the general public
(Flash). The online help system is embodied using a 3D talking head (developed
by FT R&D) which ""says"" oral help messages illustrated with Flash screen
copies."
"We present a survey of recent research studies of the implementation of
adaptive user models in human-computer interaction. A classification of
research directions on adaptive user interfaces is first proposed; it takes
account of the user characteristics that are modelled, the distribution of
initiative and control of the system evolution between user and system, and the
role of dynamic adaptation. Then, a few representative research studies are
briefly presented to illustrate this classification. In the conclusion, some
major issues regarding the utility and usability of adaptive user interfaces
and the design of an appropriate methodology for assessing the ergonomic
quality of this new form of interaction are mentioned."
"The observation that novice users seldom consult online help was made over
twenty years ago. This observation still holds nowadays, although online help
to the use of software for the general public has greatly improved in usability
during this period. The paper first demonstrates the necessity of online help
to the use of new software whatever the transparency of the user interface, as
whether online help systems are meant to compensate for interface design
weaknesses or actually do provide necessary assistance to the discovery of a
new software package functionalities is still an unsolved issue. The discussion
relies on results of empirical and experimental studies and theoretical
arguments. In the second part, we analyse the specific difficulties raised by
the design of effective online help systems for current software intended for
the general public so as to try and understand the reluctance of novice users
to use online help. In the last part, we present and discuss the possible
contributions of various approaches to solving this issue. Recent interaction
paradigms and techniques are considered, such as, static and dynamic
personalisation, contextual online help and new forms of multimodality."
"We propose a software architecture for interactive systems which allows
integrating the user's emotion. Emotion can be involved in interaction at
several levels. In our application case - ballet dance - emotions is
explicitely manipulated by the interactive system to produce emotion-wise
output. Our architecture model to develop emotion-wise applications is based on
the PAC-Amodeus model. We add a branch to this model, divided into three
components: Data capture, analysis and cue extraction, and finally
interpretation of those cues. We show the different data flows between this
architecture's components depending on the entry point of the emotion branch
within the system. We then illustrate our model by describing our application
case: capturing a ballet dancer's movement to extract the emotions he expresses
and use these emotions to generate graphical content that is displayed on
stage."
"In this paper we present a preliminary study for designing interactive
systems that are sensible to human emotions based on the body movements. To do
so, we first review the literature on the various approaches for defining and
characterizing human emotions. After justifying the adopted characterization
space for emotions, we then focus on the movement characteristics that must be
captured by the system for being able to recognize the human emotions."
"This paper describes an experimental study that aims at assessing the actual
contribution of voice system messages to visual search efficiency and comfort.
Messages which include spatial information on the target location are meant to
support search for familiar targets in collections of photographs (30 per
display). 24 participants carried out 240 visual search tasks in two conditions
differing from each other in initial target presentation only. The isolated
target was presented either simultaneously with an oral message (multimodal
presentation, MP), or without any message (visual presentation, VP). Averaged
target selection times were thrice longer and errors almost twice more frequent
in the VP condition than in the MP condition. In addition, the contribution of
spatial messages to visual search rapidity and accuracy was influenced by
display layout and task difficulty. Most results are statistically significant.
Besides, subjective judgments indicate that oral messages were well accepted."
"This paper presents a review of methods for collecting and analysing data on
complex activities. Starting with methods developed for design, we examine the
possibility to transpose them to other complex activities, especially
activities referring to sensorial expertise. R\'esum\'e Ce texte pr\'esente une
revue de m\'ethodes pour recueillir et analyser des donn\'ees sur des
actvit\'es complexes. A partir de m\'ethodes d\'evelopp\'ees pour des
actvit\'es de conception, nous examinons la possibilit\'e de les transposer \`a
d'autres actvit\'es complexes, notamment des actvit\'es faisant \`a appel \`a
des expertises sensorielles."
"This paper focuses on the use of knowledge possessed by designers. Data
collection was based on observations (by the cognitive ergonomics researcher)
and simultaneous verbalisations (by the designers) in empirical studies
conducted in the context of industrial design projects. The contribution of
this research is typical of cognitive ergonomics, in that it provides data on
actual activities implemented by designers in their actual work situation
(rather than on prescribed and/or idealised processes and methods). Data
presented concern global strategies (the way in which designers actually
organise their activity) and local strategies (reuse in design). Results from
cognitive ergonomics and other research that challenges the way in which people
are supposed to work with existing systems are generally not received warmly.
Abundant corroboration of such results is required before industry may consider
taking them into account. The opportunistic organisation of design activity is
taken here as an example of this reluctance. The results concerning this aspect
of design have been verified repeatedly, but only prototypes and experimental
systems implementing some of the requirements formulated on their basis, are
under development."
"This article presents a cognitively oriented viewpoint on design. It focuses
on cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, i.e., the actual cognitive
activity implemented by designers during their work on professional design
projects. Rather than conceiving de-signing as problem solving - Simon's
symbolic information processing (SIP) approach - or as a reflective practice or
some other form of situated activity - the situativity (SIT) approach - we
consider that, from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is most appropriately
characterised as a construction of representations. After a critical discussion
of the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our view-point. This
presentation concerns the evolving nature of representations regarding levels
of abstraction and degrees of precision, the function of external
representations, and specific qualities of representation in collective design.
Designing is described at three levels: the organisation of the activity, its
strategies, and its design-representation construction activities (different
ways to generate, trans-form, and evaluate representations). Even if we adopt a
""generic design"" stance, we claim that design can take different forms
depending on the nature of the artefact, and we propose some candidates for
dimensions that allow a distinction to be made between these forms of design.
We discuss the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of cognitive
design research occupied with the quality of design. We close our discussion of
representational structures and activities by an outline of some directions
regarding their functional linkages."
"Nowadays, more and more surgical interventions are carried out in Minimally
Invasive Surgery, to make the post-operative constraints less painful for the
patient. Actually, new surgical tools or medical products are designed after
informal discussions between surgeons and designers. The user requirements
documents are the main document used by the mechanical designers to design and
improve the product. Medical terms, often used by surgeons and employed to
explain their needs, don't allow for an instantaneous understanding by
designers. Unfortunately, this relation causes a dysfunction in the definition
cycle of the product. Our aim is to work on the design process, its assistance
thanks to methods and tools and on its organisation for better understandings
and more complementarities between surgeons and designers. We propose on this
article a design method already tested in the informatics domain: User Centred
Design which takes the user into account more effectively in the process
design. We already propose a scenario oriented design method centred on the
user and represented as a scenario (Scenario-Based Design). We start in this
article by clarifying these concepts before detailing their implementation for
the design of a new surgical tool."
"The aim of this paper is to propose an approach based on the concept of
annotation for supporting design communication. In this paper, we describe a
co-operative design case study where we analyse some annotation practices,
mainly focused on design minutes recorded during project reviews. We point out
specific requirements concerning annotation needs. Based on these requirements,
we propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to
support communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of
annotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary
annotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a
set of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing
express/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory
debates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,
and we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design
context, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.
After the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse
annotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section
is dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and
define the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic
annotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based
on our approach."
"It is suggested that a new area of CSCR (Computer Supported Collaborative
Research) is distinguished from CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work)
and CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) and that the demarcation
between the three areas could do with greater clarification and prescription.
  Although the areas of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), CSCW, and CSCL are
now relatively well established, the related field of Computer Supported
Collaborative Research (CSCR) is new and little understood. An analysis of the
principles and issues behind CSCR is undertaken with a view to determining
precisely its nature and scope and to delineate it clearly from CSCW and CSCL.
This determination is such that it is generally applicable to the building,
design and evaluation of collaborative research environments.
  A particular instance of the CSCR domain is then examined in order to
determine the requirements of a collaborative research environment for students
and supervisors (CRESS)."
"Cooperation between actors in design and construction activities in
architecture is an essential stake nowadays. In professional practices the
actors involved in construction projects use numerous tools. The project is
unique but the ""views"" that actors manipulate are various and sometimes
fundamentally different. Their common characteristic is that they partially
represent the cooperation context through a specific point of view.
""Bat'iViews"" suggests to the actors a multi-view interface of the context and
enables to navigate through the different views. This proposition is based on a
model-driven approach. We distinguish between ""context modelling"" and modelling
of concepts represented in each ""businessview"". A model integrative
infrastructure allows us to develop the prototype and to manage user
interaction through the definition of models' transformations."
"In the Architecture Engineering and Construction sector (AEC) cooperation
between actors is essential for project success. The configuration of actors'
organization takes different forms like the associated coordination mechanisms.
Our approach consists in analyzing these coordination mechanisms through the
identification of the ""base practices"" realized by the actors of a construction
project to cooperate. We also try with practitioners to highlight the ""best
practices"" of cooperation. Then we suggest here two prototypes of IT services
aiming to demonstrate the value added of IT to support cooperation. These
prototype tools allow us to sensitize the actors through terrain experiments
and then to bring inch by inch the Luxembourgish AEC sector towards electronic
cooperation."
"The understanding of context and context-awareness is very important for the
areas of handheld and ubiquitous computing. Unfortunately, at present, there
has not been a satisfactory definition of these two concepts that would lead to
a more effective communication in humancomputer interaction. As a result, on
the one hand, application designers are not able to choose what context to use
in their applications and on the other, they cannot determine the type of
context-awareness behaviours their applications should exhibit. In this work,
we aim to provide answers to some fundamental questions that could enlighten us
on the definition of context and its functionality."
"All of the countries within Africa experience a serious shortage of medical
professionals, particularly specialists, a problem that is only exacerbated by
high emigration of doctors with better prospects overseas. As a result, those
that remain in Africa, particularly those practicing in rural regions,
experience a shortage of specialists and other colleagues with whom to exchange
ideas. Telemedicine and teleconsultation are key areas that attempt to address
this problem by leveraging remote expertise for local problems. This paper
presents an overview of teleconsultation in the developing world, with a
particular focus on how lessons learned apply to Africa. By teleconsultation,
we are addressing non-real-time communication between health care professionals
for the purposes of providing expertise and informal recommendations, without
the real-time, interactive requirements typical of diagnosis and patient care,
which is impractical for the vast majority of existing medical practices. From
these previous experiences, we draw a set of guidelines and examine their
relevance to Ghana in particular. Based on 6 weeks of needs assessment, we
identify key variables that guide our framework, and then illustrate how our
framework is used to inform the iterative design of a prototype system."
"Computer-mediated communication systems can be used to bridge the gap between
doctors in underserved regions with local shortages of medical expertise and
medical specialists worldwide. To this end, we describe the design of a
prototype remote consultation system intended to provide the social,
institutional and infrastructural context for sustained, self-organizing growth
of a globally-distributed Ghanaian medical community. The design is grounded in
an iterative design process that included two rounds of extended design
fieldwork throughout Ghana and draws on three key design principles (social
networks as a framework on which to build incentives within a self-organizing
network; optional and incremental integration with existing referral
mechanisms; and a weakly-connected, distributed architecture that allows for a
highly interactive, responsive system despite failures in connectivity). We
discuss initial experiences from an ongoing trial deployment in southern Ghana."
"In the spreadsheet error community, both academics and practitioners
generally have ignored the rich findings produced by a century of human error
research. These findings can suggest ways to reduce errors; we can then test
these suggestions empirically. In addition, research on human error seems to
suggest that several common prescriptions and expectations for reducing errors
are likely to be incorrect. Among the key conclusions from human error research
are that thinking is bad, that spreadsheets are not the cause of spreadsheet
errors, and that reducing errors is extremely difficult."
"As users begin to use many more devices for personal information management
(PIM) than just the traditional desktop computer, it is essential for HCI
researchers to understand how these devices are being used in the wild and
their roles in users' information environments. We conducted a study of 220
knowledge workers about their devices, the activities they performed on each,
and the groups of devices used together. Our findings indicate that several
devices are often used in groups; integrated multi-function portable devices
have begun to replace single-function devices for communication (e.g. email and
IM). Users use certain features opportunistically because they happen to be
carrying a multi-function device with them. The use of multiple devices and
multi-function devices is fraught with compromises as users must choose and
make trade-offs among various factors."
"We report on a series of experiments concerning the feasibility of example
driven modelling. The main aim was to establish experimentally within an
academic environment: the relationship between error and task complexity using
a) Traditional spreadsheet modelling; b) example driven techniques. We report
on the experimental design, sampling, research methods and the tasks set for
both control and treatment groups. Analysis of the completed tasks allows
comparison of several different variables. The experimental results compare the
performance indicators for the treatment and control groups by comparing
accuracy, experience, training, confidence measures, perceived difficulty and
perceived completeness. The various results are thoroughly tested for
statistical significance using: the Chi squared test, Fisher's exact test for
significance, Cochran's Q test and McNemar's test on difficulty."
"The risks of spreadsheet use do not just come from the misuse of formulae. As
such, training needs to go beyond this technical aspect of spreadsheet use and
look at the spreadsheet in its full business context. While standard training
is by and large unable to do this, task-based training is perfectly suited to a
contextual approach to training."
"Past research shows that spreadsheet models are prone to such a high
frequency of errors and data security implications that the risk management of
spreadsheet development and spreadsheet use is of great importance to both
industry and academia. The underlying rationale for this paper is that
spreadsheet training courses should specifically address risk management in the
development process both from a generic and a domain-specific viewpoint. This
research specifically focuses on one of these namely those generic issues of
risk management that should be present in a training course that attempts to
meet good-practice within industry. A pilot questionnaire was constructed
showing a possible minimum set of risk management issues and sent to academics
and industry practitioners for feedback. The findings from this pilot survey
will be used to refine the questionnaire for sending to a larger body of
possible respondents. It is expected these findings will form the basis of a
risk management teaching approach to be trialled in a number of selected
ongoing spreadsheet training courses."
"Developments in Mobile Computing are putting pressure on the software
industry to research new modes of interaction that do not rely on the
traditional keyboard and mouse combination. Computer users suffering from
Repetitive Strain Injury also seek an alternative to keyboard and mouse devices
to reduce suffering in wrist and finger joints. Voice-control is an alternative
approach to spreadsheet development and debugging that has been researched and
used successfully in other domains. While voice-control technology for
spreadsheets is available its effectiveness has not been investigated. This
study is the first to compare the performance of a set of expert spreadsheet
developers that debugged a spreadsheet using voice-control technology and
another set that debugged the same spreadsheet using keyboard and mouse. The
study showed that voice, despite its advantages, proved to be slower and less
accurate. However, it also revealed ways in which the technology might be
improved to redress this imbalance."
"Spreadsheet engineering methodologies are diverse and sometimes
contradictory. It is difficult for spreadsheet developers to identify a
spreadsheet engineering methodology that is appropriate for their class of
spreadsheet, with its unique combination of goals, type of problem, and
available time and resources. There is a lack of well-organized, proven
methodologies with known costs and benefits for well-defined spreadsheet
classes. It is difficult to compare and critically evaluate methodologies. We
present a paradigm for organizing and interpreting spreadsheet engineering
recommendations. It systematically addresses the myriad choices made when
developing a spreadsheet, and explicitly considers resource constraints and
other development parameters. This paradigm provides a framework for
evaluation, comparison, and selection of methodologies, and a list of essential
elements for developers or codifiers of new methodologies. This paradigm
identifies gaps in our knowledge that merit further research."
"This paper presents a toolkit for spreadsheet visualization based on logical
areas, semantic classes and data modules. Logical areas, semantic classes and
data modules are abstract representations of spreadsheet programs that are
meant to reduce the auditing and comprehension effort, especially for large and
regular spreadsheets. The toolkit is integrated as a plug-in in the Gnumeric
spreadsheet system for Linux. It can process large, industry scale spreadsheet
programs in reasonable time and is tightly integrated with its host spreadsheet
system. Users can generate hierarchical and graph-based representations of
their spreadsheets. This allows them to spot conceptual similarities in
different regions of the spreadsheet, that would otherwise not fit on a screen.
As it is assumed that the learning effort for effective use of such a tool
should be kept low, we aim for intuitive handling of most of the tool's
functions."
"This paper extends a spreadsheet visualization technique by using layout
information. The original approach identifies logically or semantically related
cells by relying exclusively on the content of cells for identifying semantic
classes. A disadvantage of semantic classes is that users have to supply
parameters which describe the possible shapes of these blocks. The correct
parametrization requires a certain degree of experience and is thus not
suitable for untrained users. To avoid this constraint, the approach reported
in this paper uses row/column-labels as well as common format information for
locating areas with common, recurring semantics. Heuristics are provided to
distinguish between cell groups with intended common semantics and cell groups
related in an ad-hoc manner."
"This paper discusses spreadsheets documentation and new means to achieve this
end by using Excel's built-in ""Comment"" function. By structuring comments, they
can be used as an essential tool to fully explain spreadsheet. This will
greatly facilitate spreadsheet change control, risk management and auditing. It
will fill a crucial gap in corporate governance by adding essential information
that can be managed in order to satisfy internal controls and accountability
standards."
"Visualizing spreadsheet content provides analytic insight and visual
validation of large amounts of spreadsheet data. Oculus Excel Visualizer is a
point and click data visualization experiment which directly visualizes Excel
data and re-uses the layout and formatting already present in the spreadsheet."
"The research presented in this paper establishes a valid, and simplified,
revision of previous spreadsheet error classifications. This investigation is
concerned with the results of a web survey and two web-based gender and
domain-knowledge free spreadsheet error identification exercises. The
participants of the survey and exercises were a test group of professionals
(all of whom regularly use spreadsheets) and a control group of students from
the University of Greenwich (UK). The findings show that over 85% of users are
also the spreadsheet's developer, supporting the revised spreadsheet error
classification. The findings also show that spreadsheet error identification
ability is directly affected both by spreadsheet experience and by error-type
awareness. In particular, that spreadsheet error-type awareness significantly
improves the user's ability to identify, the more surreptitious, qualitative
error."
"We developed an internet-based questionnaire on spreadsheet use that we
administered to a large number of users in several companies and organizations
to document how spreadsheets are currently being developed and used in
business. In this paper, we discuss the results drawn from of a comparison of
responses from individuals with the most experience and expertise with those
from individuals with the least. These results describe two views of
spreadsheet design and use in organizations, and reflect gaps between these two
groups and between these groups and the entire population of nearly 1600
respondents. Moreover, our results indicate that these gaps have multiple
dimensions: they reflect not only the context, skill, and practices of
individual users but also the policies of large organizations."
"The hard coding of input data or constants into spreadsheet formulas is
widely recognised as poor spreadsheet model design. However, the importance of
avoiding such practice appears to be underestimated perhaps in light of the
lack of quantitative error at the time of occurrence and the recognition that
this design defect may never result in a bottom-line error. The paper examines
both the academic and practitioner view of such hard coding design flaws. The
practitioner or industry viewpoint is gained indirectly through a review of
commercial spreadsheet auditing software. The development of an automated
(electronic) means for detecting such hard coding is described together with a
discussion of some results obtained through analysis of a number of student and
practitioner spreadsheet models."
"Even relatively simple code analysis can be a daunting task for many first
year students. Perceived complexity, coupled with foreign and harsh syntax,
often outstrips the ability for students to take in what they are seeing in
terms of their verbal memory. That is, first year students often lack the
experience to encode critical building blocks in source code, and their
interrelationships, into their own words. We believe this argues for the need
for IDEs to provide additional support for representations that would appeal
directly to visual memory. In this paper, we examine this need for intuitive
source code visualization tools that are easily accessible to novice
programmers, discuss the requirements for such a tool, and suggest a novel idea
that takes advantage of human peripheral vision to achieve stronger overall
code structure awareness."
"With customer relationship management (CRM) companies move away from a mainly
product-centered view to a customer-centered view. Resulting from this change,
the effective management of how to keep contact with customers throughout
different channels is one of the key success factors in today's business world.
Company Web sites have evolved in many industries into an extremely important
channel through which customers can be attracted and retained. To analyze and
optimize this channel, accurate models of how customers browse through the Web
site and what information within the site they repeatedly view are crucial.
Typically, data mining techniques are used for this purpose. However, there
already exist numerous models developed in marketing research for traditional
channels which could also prove valuable to understanding this new channel. In
this paper we propose the application of an extension of the Logarithmic Series
Distribution (LSD) model repeat-usage of Web-based information and thus to
analyze and optimize a Web Site's capability to support one goal of CRM, to
retain customers. As an example, we use the university's blended learning web
portal with over a thousand learning resources to demonstrate how the model can
be used to evaluate and improve the Web site's effectiveness."
"As the need for advanced, interactive mathematical models has increased,
user/programmers are increasingly choosing the MatLab scripting language over
spreadsheets. However, applications developed in these tools have high error
risk, and no best practices exist. We recommend that advanced, highly
mathematical applications incorporate these tools with spreadsheets into hybrid
applications, where developers can apply EuSpRIG best practices. Development of
hybrid applications can reduce the potential for errors, shorten development
time, and enable higher level operations. We believe that hybrid applications
are the future and over the course of this paper, we apply and extend
spreadsheet best practices to reduce or prevent risks in hybrid Excel/MatLab
applications."
"Contemporary spreadsheets are plagued by a profusion of errors, auditing
difficulties, lack of uniform development methodologies, and barriers to easy
comprehension of the underlying business models they represent. This paper
presents a case that most of these difficulties stem from the fact that the
standard spreadsheet user-interaction paradigm - the 'cell-matrix' approach -
is appropriate for spreadsheet data presentation but has significant drawbacks
with respect to spreadsheet creation, maintenance and comprehension when
workbooks pass a minimal threshold of complexity. An alternative paradigm for
the automated generation of spreadsheets directly from plain-language business
model descriptions is presented along with its potential benefits. Sunsight
Modeller (TM), a working software system implementing the suggested paradigm,
is briefly described."
"There is no denying that spreadsheets have become critical for all
operational processes including financial reporting, budgeting, forecasting,
and analysis. Microsoft Excel has essentially become a scratch pad and a data
browser that can quickly be put to use for information gathering and
decision-making. However, there is little control in how data comes into Excel,
and how it gets updated. The information supply chain feeding into Excel
remains ad hoc and without any centralized IT control. This paper discusses
some of the pitfalls of the data collection and maintenance process in Excel.
It then suggests service-oriented architecture (SOA) based information
gathering and control techniques to ameliorate the pitfalls of this scratch pad
while improving the integrity of data, boosting the productivity of the
business users, and building controls to satisfy the requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."
"Human error research on overconfidence supports the benefits of early
visibility of defects and disciplined development. If risk to the enterprise is
to be reduced, individuals need to become aware of the reality of the quality
of their work. Several cycles of inspection and defect removal are inevitable.
Software Quality Management measurements of defect density and removal
efficiency are applicable. Research of actual spreadsheet error rates shows
data consistent with other software depending on the extent to which the work
product was reviewed before inspection. The paper argues that the payback for
an investment in early review time is justified by the saving in project delay
and expensive errors in use.

"We present HIC (Human-system Interaction Container), a general framework for
the integration of advanced interaction in the software development process. We
show how this framework allows to reconcile the software development methods
(such MDA, MDE) with the architectural models of software design such as MVC or
PAC. We illustrate our approach thanks to two different types of implementation
for this concept in two different business areas: one software design pattern,
MVIC (Model View Interaction Control) and one architectural model, IM
(Interaction Middleware)."
"In this paper we present a case study of use of wearable computer within the
framework of activities of maintenance and repairing. Besides the study of
configuration of this wearable computer and its peripherals, we show the
integration of context, in-situ storage, traceability and regulation in these
activities. This case study is in the scope of a huge project called HMTD (Help
Me To Do) which aim is to apply MOCOCO (Mobility, COoperation,
COntextualisation) and IMERA (Mobile Interaction in the Augmented Real
Environment) principles for better use, maintenance and repairing of equipments
in the domestic, public and professional situations."
"This paper offers a brief review of cognitive verbs typically used in the
literature to describe standard spreadsheet practices. The verbs identified are
then categorised in terms of Bloom's Taxonomy of Hierarchical Levels, and then
rated and arranged to distinguish some of their qualities and characteristics.
Some measurement items are then evaluated to see how well computerised test
question items validate or reinforce training or certification. The paper
considers how establishing standard practices in spreadsheet training and
certification can help reduce some of the risks associated with spreadsheets,
and help promote productivity."
"We propose a research strategy for creating and deploying prescriptive
recommendations for spreadsheet practice. Empirical data on usage can be used
to create a taxonomy of spreadsheet classes. Within each class, existing
practices and ideal practices can he combined into proposed best practices for
deployment. As a first step we propose a scoping survey to gather non-anecdotal
data on spreadsheet usage. The scoping survey will interview people who develop
spreadsheets. We will investigate the determinants of spreadsheet importance,
identify current industry practices, and document existing standards for
creation and use of spreadsheets. The survey will provide insight into user
attributes, spreadsheet importance, and current practices. Results will be
valuable in themselves, and will guide future empirical research."
"Current prescriptions for spreadsheet style specify modular separation of
data, calcu1ation and output, based on the notion that writing a spreadsheet is
like writing a computer program. Instead of a computer programming style, this
article examines rules of style for text, graphics, and mathematics. Much
'common wisdom' in spreadsheets contradicts rules for these well-developed
arts. A case is made here for a new style for spreadsheets that emphasises
readability. The new style is described in detail with an example, and
contrasted with the programming style."
"A semiotic model of the user interface in human-computer interaction.

"The shape and size of the objects, which we see on the screen, when the
application is running, are defined at the design time. By using some sort of
adaptive interface, developers give users a chance to resize these objects or
on rare occasion even change, but all these changes are predetermined by a
developer; user can't go out of the designer's scenario. Making each and all
elements moveable / resizable and giving users the full control of these
processes, changes the whole idea of applications; programs become user-driven
and significantly increase the effectiveness of users' work. This article is
about the instrument to turn any screen object into moveable / resizable."
"An integral part of spreadsheet auditing is navigation. For sufferers of
Repetitive Strain Injury who need to use voice recognition technology this
navigation can be highly problematic. To counter this the authors have
developed an intelligent voice navigation system, iVoice, which replicates
common spreadsheet auditing behaviours through simple voice commands. This
paper outlines the iVoice system and summarizes the results of a study to
evaluate iVoice when compared to a leading voice recognition technology."
"We report the results of a project to control the use of end user computing
tools for business critical applications in a banking environment. Several
workstreams were employed in order to bring about a cultural change within the
bank towards the use of spreadsheets and other end-user tools, covering policy
development, awareness and skills training, inventory monitoring, user
licensing, key risk metrics and mitigation approaches. The outcomes of these
activities are discussed, and conclusions are drawn as to the need for
appropriate organisational models to guide the use of these tools."
"Accounting and Finance (A&F) Professionals are arguably the most loyal and
concentrated population of spreadsheet users. The work that they perform in
spreadsheets has the most significant impact on financial data and business
processes within global organizations today. Spreadsheets offer the flexibility
and ease of use of a desktop application, combined with the power to perform
complex data analysis. They are also the lowest cost business IT tool when
stacked up against other functional tools. As a result, spreadsheets are used
to support critical business processes in most organizations. In fact, research
indicates that over half of financial management reporting is performed with
spreadsheets by an accounting and finance professional. A disparity exists in
the business world between the importance of spreadsheets on financial data
(created by A&F Professionals) and the resources devoted to: The development
and oversight of global spreadsheet standards; A recognized and accredited
certification in spreadsheet proficiency; Corporate sponsored and required
training; Awareness of emerging technologies as it relates to spreadsheet use.
This management paper focuses on the current topics relevant to the largest
user group (A&F Professionals) of the most widely used financial software
application, spreadsheets, also known as the accountant's hammer."
"The DidaTab project (Didactics of Spreadsheet, teaching and learning
spreadsheets) is a three year project (2005-2007) funded by the French Ministry
of Research and dedicated to the study of personal and classroom uses of
spreadsheets in the French context, focussing on the processes of appropriation
and uses by secondary school students. In this paper, we present an overview of
the project, briefly report the studies performed in the framework of the
DidaTab project, and give the main results we obtained. We then explore the new
research tracks we intend to develop, more in connection with EuSpRIG. Our main
result is that the use of spreadsheet during secondary education (grade 6 to
12) is rather sparse for school work (and even more seldom at home) and that
student competencies are weak. Curricula have to be reviewed to include more
training of dynamics tabular tools (including databases queries) in order to
ensure sufficient mastery of computer tools that have became necessary in many
educational activities."
"Graphs are typically visualized as node-link diagrams. Although there is a
fair amount of research focusing on crossing minimization to improve
readability, little attention has been paid on how to handle crossings when
they are an essential part of the final visualizations. This requires us to
understand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance.
  As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was
conducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of
crossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance.
Sixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six
drawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra
eye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have
little impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a
path between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the
path go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view
to further confirmation in future work."
"The work is devoted to a problem of search of metaphors for interactive
systems and systems based on Virtual Reality (VR) environments. The analysis of
magic fairy tales as a source of metaphors for interface and virtual reality is
offered. Some results of design process based on magic metaphors are
considered."
"We feel happy when web-browsing operations provide us with necessary
information; otherwise, we feel bitter. How to measure this happiness (or
bitterness)? How does the profile of happiness grow and decay during the course
of web-browsing? We propose a probabilistic framework that models evolution of
user satisfaction, on top of his/her continuous frustration at not finding the
required information. It is found that the cumulative satisfaction profile of a
web-searching individual can be modeled effectively as the sum of random number
of random terms, where each term is mutually independent random variable,
originating from 'memoryless' Poisson flow. Evolution of satisfaction over the
entire time interval of user's browsing was modeled with auto-correlation
analysis. A utilitarian marker, magnitude of greater than unity of which
describe happy web-searching operations; and an empirical limit that connects
user's satisfaction with his frustration level - are proposed too. Presence of
pertinent information in the very first page of a web-site and magnitude of the
decay parameter of user satisfaction (frustration, irritation etc.), are found
to be two key aspects that dominate web-browser's psychology. The proposed
model employed different combination of decay parameter, searching time and
number of helpful web-sites. Obtained results are found to match the results
from three real-life case-studies."
"This paper presents a study of user voting on three websites: Imdb, Amazon
and BookCrossings. It reports on an expert evaluation of the voting mechanisms
of each website and a quantitative data analysis of users' aggregate voting
behavior. The results suggest that voting follows different patterns across the
websites, with higher barrier to vote introducing a more of one-off voters and
attracting mostly experts. The results also show that that one-off voters tend
to vote on popular items, while experts mostly vote for obscure, low-rated
items. The study concludes with design suggestions to address the ""wisdom of
the crowd"" bias."
"Ideas about how to increase the unconscious participation in interaction
between 'a human' and 'a computer' are developed in this paper. Evidence of
impact of the unconscious functioning is presented. The unconscious is
characterised as being a responsive, contextual, and autonomous participant of
human-computer interaction. The unconscious participation occurs independently
of one's cognitive and educational levels and, if ignored, leads to learning
inefficiencies and compulsive behaviours, illustrations of which are provided.
Three practical approaches to a study of subjective user experience are
outlined as follows: (a) tracing operant conditioning effects of software, (b)
registering signs of brain activity psychological or information processing
meaning of which is well-explored and (c) exploring submodality interfaces.
Implications for improvement of current usability study methods, such as
eye-tracking, are generally considered. Conclusions consider advantages and
disadvantages of unconscious-embracing design and remind about a loss of human
evolutionary choices if unconscious participation is ignored, complicated or
blocked in interaction with computer interfaces and built environment."
"Reading documents on mobile devices is challenging. Not only are screens
small and difficult to read, but also navigating an environment using limited
visual attention can be difficult and potentially dangerous. Reading content
aloud using text-tospeech (TTS) processing can mitigate these problems, but
only for content that does not include rich visual information. In this paper,
we introduce a new technique, SeeReader, that combines TTS with automatic
content recognition and document presentation control that allows users to
listen to documents while also being notified of important visual content.
Together, these services allow users to read rich documents on mobile devices
while maintaining awareness of their visual environment."
"Selection methods that require only a single-switch input, such as a button
click or blink, are potentially useful for individuals with motor impairments,
mobile technology users, and individuals wishing to transmit information
securely. We present a single-switch selection method, ""Nomon,"" that is general
and efficient. Existing single-switch selection methods require selectable
options to be arranged in ways that limit potential applications. By contrast,
traditional operating systems, web browsers, and free-form applications (such
as drawing) place options at arbitrary points on the screen. Nomon, however,
has the flexibility to select any point on a screen. Nomon adapts automatically
to an individual's clicking ability; it allows a person who clicks precisely to
make a selection quickly and allows a person who clicks imprecisely more time
to make a selection without error. Nomon reaps gains in information rate by
allowing the specification of beliefs (priors) about option selection
probabilities and by avoiding tree-based selection schemes in favor of direct
(posterior) inference. We have developed both a Nomon-based writing application
and a drawing application. To evaluate Nomon's performance, we compared the
writing application with a popular existing method for single-switch writing
(row-column scanning). Novice users wrote 35% faster with the Nomon interface
than with the scanning interface. An experienced user (author TB, with > 10
hours practice) wrote at speeds of 9.3 words per minute with Nomon, using 1.2
clicks per character and making no errors in the final text."
"User experience (UX) evaluation is gaining increased interest lately, both
from academia and industry. In this paper we argue that UX evaluation needs to
fulfill two important requirements: scalability, i.e. the ability to provide
useful feedback in different stages of the design, and diversity, i.e. the
ability to reflect the di-versity of opinions that may exist in different
users. We promote the use of the Repertory Grid Technique as a promising UX
evaluation technique and discuss some of our concerns regarding the
quantitative side of its use."
"We developed a system that augments traditional office whiteboards with
computation for the purposes of retrieving, reusing, and sharing whiteboard
content. Our system automatically captures changes to whiteboard images,
detects significant changes, and identifies potential collaborative activities.
Users then browse and search the collection of images captured from their
camera or shared from other users' cameras based on aspects such as location,
time, collaboration, etc. We report on the results of a formative study and on
an evaluation of effectiveness of our system, and discuss additional
functionality that can be built on our framework."
"Collaborative edition is achieved by distinct sites that work independently
on (a copy of) a shared document. Conflicts may arise during this process and
must be solved by the collaborative editor. In pure Peer to Peer collaborative
editing, no centralization nor locks nor time-stamps are used which make
conflict resolution difficult. We propose an algorithm which relies on the
notion or semantics dependence and avoids the need of any integration
transformation to solve conflicts. Furthermore, it doesn't use any history file
recording operations performed since starting the edition process. We show how
to define editing operations for semi-structured documents i.e. XML-like trees,
that are enriched with informations derived for free from the editing process.
Then we define the semantics dependence relation required by the algorithm and
we present preliminary results obtained by a prototype implementation."
"As far as music is concerned, instruments have always been part of a cultural
?landscape? (on technical, expressive and symbolic levels). The present
contribution explores the changes brought about by the shift that occurred
during the 20th century, from mechanical to digital instruments (also named
?virtual instruments?). First and foremost, a short recall of some historical
steps of the technological developments that have renewed our relationship to
sound, music, and instruments will be presented. Second, an analysis of
different discourses and terminologies presently used in the domains of
musicology and computer music will account for the evolution of the notion of
instrumentality."
"Memorizing the user commands has been a problem since long. In this study we
try to propose solutions to overcome two problems - the problem of selecting
appropriate commands names during application development and the problem of
memorizing these command names. The proposed solution includes a framework in
which the applications can plug into, to get their application commands and
corresponding tags in to the new command execution application.We also propose
a mechanism where user can generate her own set of tags for a command and share
those with peers."
"This article presents the Cogni-CISMeF project, which aims at improving the
health information search engine CISMeF, by including a conversational agent
that interacts with the user in natural language. To study the cognitive
processes involved during information search, a bottom-up methodology was
adopted. An experiment has been set up to obtain human dialogs related to such
searches. The analysis of these dialogs underlines the establishment of a
common ground and accommodation effects to the user. A model of artificial
agent is proposed, that guides the user by proposing examples, assistance and
choices."
"A location and tracking system becomes very important to our future world of
pervasive computing. An algorithm for accurate location information is being
incorporated in the human walking model and in the blind human walking model.
We want to implement an accurate location tracking mechanism using Zigbee along
with GPS, we have incorporated Markov chain algorithm for establishing
accuracy. Normal Human and blind human walking steps were actually taken in the
known environment within our campus and the Markov chain algorithm was used for
smoothening the stepwise variation in location updates. A comparison module is
also implemented to show the difference between normal human and blind human
walking step variations. This accuracy is used for designing a blind tracking
device so that the device can be used by the blind for finding the path without
obstacles. We present a system level approach to localizing and tracking Human
and blind users on a basis of different sources of location information [GPS
plus Zigbee]. The system can be applied outdoors especially for avoiding
accidents, GPS as the source of location data. Performance evaluation shows
that the system is accurate and it is a future path finding device with service
for the blind."
"The ability of an intelligent environment to connect and adapt to real
internal sates, needs and behaviors' meaning of humans can be made possible by
considering users' emotional states as contextual parameters. In this paper, we
build on enactive psychology and investigate the incorporation of emotions in
pervasive systems. We define emotions, and discuss the coding of emotional
human markers by smart environments. In addition, we compare some existing
works and identify how emotions can be detected and modeled by a pervasive
system in order to enhance its service and response to users. Finally, we
analyze closely one XML-based language for representing and annotating emotions
known as EARL and raise two important issues which pertain to emotion
representation and modeling in XML-based languages."
"Context is a rich concept and is an elusive concept to define. The concept of
context has been studied by philosophers, linguists, psychologists, and
recently by computer scientists. Within each research community the term
context was interpreted in a certain way that is well-suited for their goals,
however no attempt was made to define context. In many areas of research in
computer science, notably on web-based services, human-computer interaction
(HCI), ubiquitous computing applications, and context-aware systems there is a
need to provide a formal operational definition of context. In this brief
survey an account of the early work on context, as well as the recent work on
many working definitions of context, context modeling, and a formalization of
context are given. An attempt is made to unify the different context models
within the formalization. A brief commentary on the usefulness of the
formalization in the development of context-aware and dependable systems is
included."

"In this article, we present the interactive opera project on CD-ROM
Virtualis. This project includes a scientific dimension as well as artistic. It
gave us the opportunity to design a model of the opera performance using
formalisms from organization sciences. Moreover, our investigation on
interactions between a user and opera contents led us to use models of
relationships between entities based on physical forces, where the user is in a
way absent. We detail some aspects of a reading but also writing environment on
artistic complex contents between text, music and graphics."
"We present iScale, a survey tool for the retrospective elicitation of
longitudinal user experience data. iScale employs sketching in imposing a
process in the reconstruction of one's experiences with the aim to minimize
retrospection bias. Two versions, the Constructive and the Value-Account
iScale, were motivated by two distinct theories on how people reconstruct
emotional experiences from memory. These two versions were tested in two
separate studies. Study 1 aimed at providing qualitative insight into the use
of iScale and compared its performance to that of free-hand sketching. Study 2
compared the two versions of iScale to free recall, a control condition that
does not influence the reconstruction process. Significant differences between
iScale and free recall were found. Overall, iScale resulted in an increase in
the amount, the richness, and the test-retest reliability of recalled
information. These results provide support for the viability of retrospective
techniques as a cost-effective alternative to longitudinal studies."
"This paper addresses the methodology for achieving the user interface design
reusability of a qualitative software system and effort minimization by
applying the inference on the stored design documents. The pictorial design
documents are stored in a special format in the form of keyword text [DGML tag
based design]. The design document storage mechanism will expose the keywords
per design stored. This methodology is having an inference engine. Inference
mechanism search for the requirements and find the match for them in the
available design repository. A match found will success in reusing it after
checking the quality parameters of the found design module in the result set.
DGML notations produces qualitative designs which helps in minimizing the
efforts of software development life cycle."
"Although 'Halcyon' means serene environment which pervasive computing aims
at, we have tried to present a different interpretation of this word. Through
our approach, we look at it in context of achieving future 'calm technology'.
The paper gives a general overview of the state of pervasive computing today,
proposes the 'HALCYON Model' and outlines the 'social' challenges faced by
system designers."
"In this paper we will describe all necessary parts of Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI), such as source of signals, hardware, software, analysis,
architectures of complete system. We also will go along various applications of
BCI, view some subject fields and their specifics. After preface we will
consider the main point of this work-concepts of using BCI in education.
Represented direction of BCI development has not been reported prior. In this
work a computer system, currently being elaborated in author's laboratory, will
be specified. A purpose of it is to determine a degree of clearness of studied
information for certain user according to their indications of brain electrical
signals. On the basis of this information the system is able to find an optimal
approach to interact with each single user. Feedback individualization leads to
learning effectiveness increasing. Stated investigations will be supplemented
by author's analytical reasoning on the nature of thinking process."
"Virtual collaborative environment are 3D shared spaces in which people can
work together. To collaborate through these systems, users must have a shared
comprehension of the environment. The objective of this experimental study was
to determine if visual stable landmarks improve the construction of a common
representation of the virtual environment and thus facilitate collaboration.
This seems to increase the awareness of the partner's presence."
"This paper proposes a more comprehensive evaluation methodology to measure
the usability and user experience qualities of accessible synchronous
computer-mediated communication applications. The methodology goes beyond
current practices by evaluating how the interaction between a user and a
product influences the user experience of those at the other endpoint of the
communication channel. A major contribution is given with the proposal of a
user test where one of the participants tries to guess whether the other
participant has a disability or not. The proposed test is inspired in the
Turing Test, and is a consequence of user requirements elicited from a group of
individuals with motor and speech disabilities. These ideas are tested and
validated with two examples of synchronous communication applications."
"Internet Banking System refers to systems that enable bank customers to
access accounts and general information on bank products and services through a
personal computer or other intelligent device. Internet banking products and
services can include detailed account information for corporate customers as
well as account summery and transfer money. Ultimately, the products and
services obtained through Internet Banking may mirror products and services
offered through other bank delivery channels. In this paper, Internet Banking
System Prototype has been proposed in order to illustrate the services which is
provided by the Bank online services."
"The P300 speller is being considered as an independent brain-computer
interface. That means it measures the user's intent, and does not require the
user to move any muscles. In particular it should not require eye fixation of
the desired character. However, it has been shown that posterior electrodes
provide significant discriminative information, which is likely related to
visual processing. These findings imply the need for studies controlling the
effect of eye movements. In experiments with a 3x3 character matrix, attention
and eye fixation was directed to different characters. In the event-related
potentials, a P300 occurred for the attended character, and N200 was seen for
the trials showing the focussed character. It occurred at posterior sites,
reaching its peak at 200ms after stimulus onset. The results suggest that gaze
direction plays an important role in P300 speller paradigm. By controlling gaze
direction it is possible to separate voluntary and involuntary EEG responses to
the highlighting of characters."
"This paper reports on empirical evaluation study of users' performance and
satisfaction with prototype of Web Based speech photo annotation with speech
interaction. Participants involved consist of Johor Bahru citizens from various
background. They have completed two parts of annotation task; part A involving
PhotoASys; photo annotation system with proposed speech interaction and part B
involving Microsoft Microsoft Vista Speech Interaction style. They have
completed eight tasks for each part including system login and selection of
album and photos. Users' performance was recorded using computer screen
recording software. Data were captured on the task completion time and
subjective satisfaction. Participants need to complete a questionnaire on the
subjective satisfaction when the task was completed. The performance data show
the comparison between proposed speech interaction and Microsoft Vista Speech
interaction applied in photo annotation system, PhotoASys. On average, the
reduction in annotation performance time due to using proposed speech
interaction style was 64.72% rather than using speech interaction Microsoft
Vista style. Data analysis were showed in different statistical significant in
annotation performance and subjective satisfaction for both styles of
interaction. These results could be used for the next design in related
software which involves personal belonging management."
"Successful collaboration depends on effective communication. Ongoing group
awareness facilitates communication by enabling workers to be more informed
about their collaborators, about their activities, and about the interpersonal
dependencies among people working together. In this paper we present MyUnity, a
new system that aids workers in building group awareness. The system uses
multiple sources, both automatic and user-provided, to report colleagues'
location, availability, current tasks, and preferred communication channels.
Information is aggregated, fused and presented as a simple presence state for
each worker. Workers can each independently control what information is
collected by the system, allowing them to participate in the system without
compromising their privacy. Results from a four-week field study show MyUnity
increased group awareness and fostered an increased sense of community in the
workplace. Results provide insights into the utility of awareness systems in
the workplace."
"Nowadays cell phone is the most common communicating used by mass people. SMS
based communication is a cheap and popular communication method. It is human
tendency to have the opportunity to write SMS in their mother language. Text
input in mother language is more flexible when the alphabets of that language
are printed on the keypad. Bangla mobile keypad based on phonetics has been
proposed earlier. But the keypad is not scientific from frequency and
flexibility point of view. Since it is not a feasible solution in this paper we
have proposed an efficient Bengali keypad for cell phone and other cellular
device. The proposed keypad is based on the frequency of the alphabets in
Bengali language and also with the view of structure of human finger movements.
We took the two points in count to provide a flexible and fast cell phone
keypad."
"The enhanced frequency based keypad is designed to speed up the typing
process. This paper will show that the proposed layout will increase the typing
speed and be flexible for thumb. Traditional cell phone keypad is not a
scientific keypad from the frequency point of view. Approaches have been
explored to speed up the typing process. We found that no manufacturer has
considered the frequency of the alphabet. The current architecture does not
provide flexibility although the users are accustomed to the currently
available multi-tapping keypad. Since the currently available keypad layouts
are not best suited for users, this paper will suggest a keypad for cell phone
and other cellular device based on the frequency of the alphabet in English
language and also with the view of structure of human finger movements to
provide a flexible and fast cell phone keypad. It also takes into consideration
the key jamming problem that was available in typewriter. At first we
identified those keys of cell phone, which are easily reachable and create less
pressure on the thumb. Thus the key frequency order is calculated from
anatomical point of view. In our proposed layout we arranged the alphabet in
the frequent keys based on the frequency of the alphabet."
"The main objective of this work is to design and construct a microcomputer
based system: to control electric appliances such as light, fan, heater,
washing machine, motor, TV, etc. The paper discusses two major approaches to
control home appliances. The first involves controlling home appliances using
timer option. The second approach is to control home appliances using voice
command. Moreover, it is also possible to control appliances using Graphical
User Interface. The parallel port is used to transfer data from computer to the
particular device to be controlled. An interface box is designed to connect the
high power loads to the parallel port. This system will play an important role
for the elderly and physically disable people to control their home appliances
in intuitive and flexible way. We have developed a system, which is able to
control eight electric appliances properly in these three modes."
"A business case study on how three simple guidelines:
  1. Make it easy to check (and maintain) 2. Make it safe to use 3. Keep
business logic out of code changed user attitudes and improved spreadsheet
quality in a financial services organisation."
"The aim of this paper is to review some work conducted in the field of user
testing that aims at specifying or clarifying the test procedures and at
defining and developing tools to help conduct user tests. The topics that have
been selected were considered relevant for evaluating applications in the field
of medical and health care informatics. These topics are: the number of
participants that should take part in a user test, the test procedure, remote
usability evaluation, usability testing tools, and evaluating mobile
applications."
"This paper examines the relationship between gestures' function and form in
design collaboration. It adopts a cognitive design research viewpoint. The
analysis is restricted to gesticulations and emblems. The data analysed come
from an empirical study conducted on an architectural design meeting. Based on
a previous analysis of the data, guided by our model of design as the
construction of representations, we distinguish representational and
organisational functions. The results of the present analysis are that, even if
form-function association tendencies exist, gestures with a particular function
may take various forms, and particular gestural movements as regards form can
fulfil different functions. Reconsidering these results and other research on
gesture, we formulate the assumption that, if formal characteristics do not
allow differentiating functional gestures in collaboration, context-dependent,
semantic characteristics may be more appropriate. We also envision the
possibility that closer inspection of the data reveal tendencies of another
nature."
"A number of data acquisition systems depend on human interface to access
computer for measuring, processing and analyzing data and to prepare it for
presentation and storage. Data acquisition software is installed on the
computer and all intended operations are performed manually. The data
acquisition software requires user intervention for operations like selection
of measurement setup, acquisition and storage of data to computer. The duty of
users becomes laborious if the data acquisition process lasts for a long
duration and requires continuous repetition of steps. An appropriate solution
to overcome such problem is to replace the physical operator with a virtual
user. This software generated simulated user sits at the data acquisition
process through out and automate all the intended steps of data acquisition.
This paper presents a new approach for data acquisition by using keyboard
emulation technique. A keyboard emulation software is developed which runs
beside the main data acquisition software and acts as a virtual user. All the
operations which require user interface are performed through fully automated
computer program. The developed software/system is executed in a real time
environment and the functionality of the software is verified. In the end,
potential application areas of the designed keyboard emulation software are
explored."
"This work aims to present novel description methods for human action
recognition. Generally, a video sequence can be represented as a collection of
spatial temporal words by detecting space-time interest points and describing
the unique features around the detected points (Bag of Words representation).
Interest points as well as the cuboids around them are considered informative
for feature description in terms of both the structural distribution of
interest points and the information content inside the cuboids. Our proposed
description approaches are based on this idea and making the feature
descriptors more discriminative."
"In this work we investigate whether browser-native technologies can be used
to perform photo manipulation tasks e.g cropping, resizing or rotating an image
within the current mainstream browser. By the use of a case study we will
analyze problems that have occurred during the implementation of a prototype
web application that utilizes browser-native web technology in order to create
an online version of a real world photo scrapbook. Implementation of a
prototype will allows us to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of current web
technology when it comes to browser-based image manipulation. Furthermore we
explore the possibilities of the Ajax in combination Canvas, SVG and VML to
provide a more interactive graphical user interface to perform image
manipulation tasks on the web."
"New technological developments have made it possible to interact with
computer systems and applications anywhere and anytime. It is vital that these
applications are able to adapt to the user, as a person, and to its current
situation, whatever that is. Therefore, the premises for evolution towards a
learning society and a knowledge economy are present. Hence, there is a
stringent demand for new learner-centred frameworks that allow active
participation of learners in knowledge creation within communities,
organizations, territories and society, at large. This paper presents the
multi-agent architecture of our context-aware system and the learning scenarios
within ubiquitous learning environments that the system provides support for.
This architecture is the outcome of our endeavour to develop ePH, a system for
sharing public interest information and knowledge, which is accessible through
always-on, context-aware services."
"In this paper we present a novel method to connect data on the visualization
level. In general, visualizations are a dead end, when it comes to reusability.
Yet, users prefer to work with visualizations as evidenced by WYSIWYG editors.
To enable users to work with their data in a way that is intuitive to them, we
have created Vizgr. Vizgr.com offers basic visualization methods, like graphs,
tag clouds, maps and time lines. But unlike normal data visualizations, these
can be re-used, connected to each other and to web sites. We offer a simple
opportunity to combine diverse data structures, such as geo-locations and
networks, with each other by a mouse click. In an evaluation, we found that
over 85 % of the participants were able to use and understand this technology
without any training or explicit instructions."
"We create a Python GUI scripting interface working under Windows in addition
to (UNIX/Linux). The GUI has been built around the Python open-source
programming language. We use the Python's GUI library that so called Python
Mega Widgets (PMW) and based on Tkinter Python module
(http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/tutgui.htm). The new GUI was
motivated primarily by the desire of more updated operations, more flexibility
incorporating future and current improvements in producing atomic data.
Furthermore it will be useful for a variety of applications of atomic physics,
plasma physics and astrophysics and will help in calculating various atomic
properties."
"Fiji National University (FNU) has been encountering many difficulties with
its current campus administrative systems. These difficulties include
accessibility, scalability, performance, flexibility and integration. In order
to address these difficulties, we developed a thin client web based campus
information system. The newly designed system allows the students, academic and
administration staff of the university to handle their day to day affairs with
the university online. In this paper we describe three types of evaluation
carried out to determine the suitability of newly developed system for FNU
environment. User interface evaluation was carried out to assess user interface
on a set of usability principles, usability evaluation to see the ease at which
users can use the system and finally performance evaluation to verify and
validate user response time required to complete various tasks. The result of
each of these evaluations were analysed and the system was rectified as part of
iterative design process."
"This paper introduces a new prototype system for controlling a PC by head
movements and also with voice commands. Our system is a multimodal interface
concerned with controlling the computer. The selected modes of interaction are
speech and gestures. We are seeing the revolutionary of computers and
information technologies into daily practice. Healthy people use keyboard,
mouse, trackball, or touchpad for controlling the PC. However these peripheries
are usually not suitable for handicapped people. They may have problems using
these standard peripheries, for example when they suffer from myopathy, or
cannot move their hands after an injury. Our system has been developed to
provide computer access for people with severe disabilities. This system tracks
the computer user's Head movements with a video camera and translates them into
the movements of the mouse pointer on the screen and the voice as button
presses. Therefore we are coming with a proposal system that can be used with
handicapped people to control the PC."
"Programs have to be designed in such a way as to make them looking good and
being handy for all users. Adaptive interface, with all the numerous
achievements throughout 30 years of its history, contains and in reality is
based on one fundamental flaw - on the assumption that designer knows better
than anyone else what is good for users in each and all cases. Programs of the
new type - user-driven applications - still deliver to users the best results
of developers' work but at the same time give users the full control over
applications and in this way really allow each user to change an application in
such a way as he wants it to look at each particular moment. Users can move and
resize each and all of the screen objects while an application is running, and
this changes the whole programming philosophy."
"The goal of this work is the identification of humans based on motion data in
the form of natural hand gestures. In this paper, the identification problem is
formulated as classification with classes corresponding to persons' identities,
based on recorded signals of performed gestures. The identification performance
is examined with a database of twenty-two natural hand gestures recorded with
two types of hardware and three state-of-art classifiers: Linear Discrimination
Analysis (LDA), Support Vector machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN).
Results show that natural hand gestures allow for an effective human
classification."
"Most of energy efficiency and carbon reduction initiatives and concepts
attempt to regulate and optimize machines behavior, and therefore, human
behavior itself is left neglected. Although most of energy and resource
consumption is the result of machines functioning and behavior (including
domesticated animals such as cows), these behaviors themselves are actually in
answer to humans demands and needs, and therefore, can be considered the
indirect results of humans behavior. Resolving the source of problems, i.e.,
the unhealthy human behavior, not only reduces these footprints including
energy and water consumption, and GHG emissions, it also helps increasing the
quality of life in society. Here, we propose an approach which focuses on
adjusting humans behavior toward eliminating unnecessary demand on the machines
that consequently lowers the consumption. This goal is achieved by creating a
social environment in which directed and selective interactions help humans to
adjust to healthier behavior. The solution consists of human-friendly
interfaces and also artificial intelligence software in order to learn and
emulate human interactions."
"This paper presents a technology that enables the watching of videos at very
high speed. Subtitles are widely used in DVD movies, and provide useful
supplemental information for understanding video contents. We propose a
""two-level fast-forwarding"" scheme for videos with subtitles, which controls
the speed of playback depending on the context: very fast during segments
without language, such as subtitles or speech, and ""understandably fast"" during
segments with such language. This makes it possible to watch videos at a higher
speed than usual while preserving the entertainment values of the contents. We
also propose ""centering"" and ""fading"" features for the display of subtitles to
reduce fatigue when watching high-speed video. We implement a versatile video
encoder that enables movie viewing with two-level fast-forwarding on any mobile
device by specifying the speed of playback, the reading rate, or the overall
viewing time. The effectiveness of our proposed method was demonstrated in an
evaluation study."
"We present a controlled, quantitative study with 12 participants comparing
interaction with a haptically enhanced mixing board against interaction with a
mouse in an abstract task that is motivated by several practical parameter
space exploration settings.
  The study participants received 24 sets of one to eight integer values
between 0 and 127, which they had to match by making adjustments with physical
or graphical sliders. Based on recorded slider motion path data, we developed
an analysis algorithm that identifies and measures different types of activity
intervals, including error time moving irrelevant sliders and end time in
breaks after completing each trial item. Our results showed a significant
increase in speed of the mixing board interaction accompanied by reduced
perceived cognitive load when compared with the traditional mouse-based GUI
interaction. The gains in speed are largely due to the improved times required
for the hand to reach for the first slider (acquisition time) and also when
moving between different ones, while the actual time spent manipulating
relevant sliders is very similar for either input device. These results agree
strongly with qualitative predictions from Fitts' Law that the larger targets
afforded by the mixer handles contributed to its faster performance. For
further investigation, we computed a measure of motion simultaneity based on
velocity correlation, which allowed to identify types of items for which
increased simultaneous adjustments occur.
  For continuous parameter space exploration our findings suggest that mixing
boards are a good option to provide detailed multi-value control. The strengths
of this input method particularly show in settings where screen space is
precious and undisrupted visual focus is crucial."
"With the rise of the open data movement a lot of statistical data has been
made publicly available by governments, statistical offices and other
organizations. First efforts to visualize are made by the data providers
themselves. Data aggregators go a step beyond: they collect data from different
open data repositories and make them comparable by providing data sets from
different providers and showing different statistics in the same chart. Another
approach is to visualize two different indicators in a scatter plot or on a
map. The integration of several data sets in one graph can have several
drawbacks: different scales and units are mixed, the graph gets visually
cluttered and one cannot easily distinguish between different indicators. Our
approach marks a combination of (1) the integration of live data from different
data sources, (2) presenting different indicators in coordinated visualizations
and (3) allows adding user visualizations to enrich official statistics with
personal data. Each indicator gets its own visualization, which fits best for
the individual indicator in case of visualization type, scale, unit etc. The
different visualizations are linked, so that related items can easily be
identified by using mouse over effects on data items."
"We present HandsInAir, a real-time collaborative wearable system for remote
collaboration. The system is developed to support real world scenarios in which
a remote mobile helper guides a local mobile worker performing a physical task.
HandsInAir implements a novel approach to support mobility of remote
collaborators. This approach allows the helper to perform gestures without
having to touch tangible objects, requiring little environment support. The
system consists of two parts: the helper part and the worker part. The two
parts are connected via a wireless network and the collaboration partners
communicate with each other via audio and visual links. In this paper, we
review related work, describe technical implementation of the system and
envision future work for further improvements."
"Is it possible to design programs which each user can change according to his
preferences? Not an illusion of such a thing that adaptive interface provides
but really an interface ruled by users. What is the main problem of such design
and what is the solution to this problem? This short article gives a glimpse
into the theory discussed in the book ""The World of Movable Objects""."
"Spreadsheets are widely used, and studies have shown that most end-user
spreadsheets contain nontrivial errors. To improve end-users productivity,
recent research proposes the use of a model-driven engineering approach to
spreadsheets. In this paper we conduct the first systematic empirical study to
assess the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach. A set of spreadsheet
end users worked with two different model-based spreadsheets, and we present
and analyze here the results achieved."
"The power of mobile devices has increased dramatically in the last few years.
These devices are becoming more sophisticated allowing users to accomplish a
wide variety of tasks while on the move. The increasingly mobile nature of
business has meant that more users will need access to spreadsheets while away
from their desktop and laptop computers. Existing mobile applications suffer
from a number of usability issues that make using spreadsheets in this way more
difficult. This work represents the first evaluation of mobile spreadsheet
applications. Through a pilot survey the needs and experiences of experienced
spreadsheet users was examined. The range of spreadsheet apps available for the
iOS platform was also evaluated in light of these users' needs."
"Since September 2007, a large scale lexical network for French is under
construction through methods based on some kind of popular consensus by means
of games (JeuxDeMots project). Human intervention can be considered as
marginal. It is limited to corrections, adjustments and validation of the
senses of terms, which amounts to less than 0,5 % of the relations in the
network. To appreciate the quality of this resource built by non-expert users
(players of the game), we use a similar approach to its construction. The
resource must be validated by laymen, persistent in time, on open class
vocabulary. We suggest to check whether our tool is able to solve the Tip of
the Tongue (TOT) problem. Just like JeuxDeMots, our tool can be considered as
an on-line game. Like the former, it allows the acquisition of new relations,
enriching thus the (existing) network."
"While usability evaluation is critical to designing usable websites,
traditional usability testing can be both expensive and time consuming. The
advent of crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and
CrowdFlower offer an intriguing new avenue for performing remote usability
testing with potentially many users, quick turn-around, and significant cost
savings. To investigate the potential of such crowdsourced usability testing,
we conducted two similar (though not completely parallel) usability studies
which evaluated a graduate school's website: one via a traditional usability
lab setting, and the other using crowdsourcing. While we find crowdsourcing
exhibits some notable limitations in comparison to the traditional lab
environment, its applicability and value for usability testing is clearly
evidenced. We discuss both methodological differences for crowdsourced
usability testing, as well as empirical contrasts to results from more
traditional, face-to-face usability testing."
"Integration of MKM services into editors has been of big interest in both
formal as well as informal areas of MKM. Until now, most of the efforts to
integrate MKM services into editing environments are done on an individual
basis which results in high creation and maintenance costs. In this paper, I
propose an architecture which allows editing environments and MKM services to
be integrated in a more efficient way. This is accomplished by integrating
editors and services only once with a real-time document synchronization and
service broker. Doing so, simplifies the development of services as well as of
editor integrations. My experience suggests that integrating new services into
an arbitrary number of already integrated editors can take as little as 3-4
hours of work."
"With the tremendous growth in the information communication sector, the
mobile phones have become the prime information communication devices. The
convergence of traditional telephony with the modern web enabled communication
in the mobile devices has made the communication much effective and simpler. As
mobile phones are becoming the crucial source of accessing the contents of the
World Wide Web which was originally designed for personal computers, has opened
up a new challenge of accommodating the web contents in to the smaller mobile
devices. This paper proposes an approach towards building a model for rendering
the web pages in mobile devices. The proposed model is based on a
multi-dimensional web page segment evaluation model. The incorporation of
personalization in the proposed model makes the rendering user-centric. The
proposed model is validated with a prototype implementation."
"This study examines the Arabic interface design elements that are largely
influenced by the cultural values. Cultural markers are examined in websites
from educational, business, and media. Cultural values analysis is based on
Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions. The findings show that there are cultural
markers which are largely influenced by the culture and that the Hofstede's
score for Arab countries is partially supported by the website design
components examined in this study. Moderate support was also found for the long
term orientation, for which Hoftsede has no score."
"Usability is often defined as the ability of a system to carry out specific
tasks by specific users in a specific context. Usability evaluation involves
testing the system for its expected usability. Usability testing is performed
in natural environment (field) or artificial environment (laboratory). The
result of usability evaluation is affected by the environment in which it is
carried out. Previous studies have focused only on the physical environment
(lab and field) effect on the results but rarely focused on the effect of
social environment (people present during testing). Therefore, this study aims
to review how important it is to take context into account during usability
evaluation. Context is explored through the theory of behaviour settings,
according to which behaviour of individuals is strongly influenced by the
physical as well as the social environment in which they function. The result
of this review indicates that the physical and social context plays a
substantial role in usability evaluations. Further, it also suggests that the
usability evaluation model should encompass context as an important component
in the framework."
"Though World Wide Web is the single largest source of information, it is
ill-equipped to serve the people with vision related problems. With the
prolific increase in the interest to make the web accessible to all sections of
the society, solving this accessibility problem becomes mandatory. This paper
presents a technique for making web pages accessible for people with low vision
issues. A model for making web pages accessible, WILI (Web Interface for people
with Low-vision Issues) has been proposed. The approach followed in this work
is to automatically replace the existing display style of a web page with a new
skin following the guidelines given by Clear Print Booklet provided by Royal
National Institute of Blind. ""Single Click Solution"" is one of the primary
advantages provided by WILI. A prototype using the WILI model is implemented
and various experiments are conducted. The results of experiments conducted on
WILI indicate 82% effective conversion rate."
"We carried out a qualitative study to identify the ""missing pieces"" in
current computing devices and technologies that are preventing people from
eliminating paper from their lives.
  Most of the existing literature has looked into the work practices of
businesses, while a few have researched how high school and college students
and teaching assistants at universities work with paper. We were specifically
interested in analysing paper use for people in the research side of academia,
and seeing how our results compare to existing work. We recruited and
interviewed participants from academia to understand what kind of tasks they
use paper for, what kind of tasks they use computing devices for and what
motivates them to use these two media.
  We found that, despite having access to at least one personal computing
device, the participants preferred to work with paper in many situations. This
appears to be attributed to certain intrinsic qualities that paper has, such as
open format, easy navigation, readability, and the aff?ordances these qualities
provide. In order to eventually replace paper with devices, designers of new
technology will have to successfully emulate these qualities."
"The field of human-centered computing has known a major progress these past
few years. It is admitted that this field is multidisciplinary and that the
human is the core of the system. It shows two matters of concern:
multidisciplinary and human. The first one reveals that each discipline plays
an important role in the global research and that the collaboration between
everyone is needed. The second one explains that a growing number of researches
aims at making the human commitment degree increase by giving him/her a
decisive role in the human-machine interaction. This paper focuses on these
both concerns and presents MICE (Machines Interaction Control in their
Environment) which is a system where the human is the one who makes the
decisions to manage the interaction with the machines. In an ambient context,
the human can decide of objects actions by creating interaction scenarios with
a new visual programming language: scenL."
"An important challenge for ubiquitous computing is the development of
techniques that can characterize a location vis-a-vis the richness and
diversity of urban settings. In this paper we report our work on correlating
urban pedestrian flows with Google search queries. Using longitudinal data we
show pedestrian flows at particular locations can be correlated with the
frequency of Google search terms that are semantically relevant to those
locations. Our approach can identify relevant content, media, and
advertisements for particular locations."
"Delivering Rich User eXperience (RUX) with the current explosion of
smartphone as real ubiquitous computing device requires adaptive application
architecture. Rich Mobile Application (RMA) is likely the candidate
architecture for future mobile applications to deliver rich, immersive
experience to the smartphone users. Research and development in domain of RMA
has started and results are appearing in literature which advocates its future
trend and encourages review of RMAs. This article aims to present overview of
RMA and states clear distinction between Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) -
that are desktop-like Web applications - and RMAs to facilitate and accelerate
development of smartphone-centric application development tools and
technologies. RMAs are defined, their comprehensive overview is presented, and
current trends are described. Our study shows that despite of literal
similarity of RMA and RIA, they have dissimilar inward architectures.
Implicitly, understanding the distinctions between richness delivery in PCs and
smartphones as well as knowledge of inward similarity and difference between
RIAs and RMAs contribute toward development of enhanced smartphone's
applications to deliver RUX to mobile clients."
"Users can't talk with computers in their natural language (machine codes), so
there are interfaces that allow such communication. 40 years ago the outcome of
computer programs was in the form of long listings covered by numbers and even
the format of those numbers was determined by developers. Throughout the latest
25 years: program views and results are shown in a wide variety of shapes and
variants, but all these possibilities are predefined and fixed in code by
developers; nothing outside of their approved solutions is allowed. My vision
from now on into the future: developers are responsible only for correct work
of a program (calculations, link with the database, etc.) and suggest a good
default interface, but not determine all possible scenarios; only users decide
WHAT, WHEN, and HOW to show. This will be a revolution in our dealing with
computers, but there are obvious questions. How this step can be made? Do all
users need such change? Is it going to be a burden for users or a welcome
revolution?"
"Technology is the making, usage and knowledge of tools, techniques, crafts,
systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or serve some
purpose. This is true for humanitarian issues also. Such as the issue of
language and its primitive attraction for its native speakers which is visible
in the cases of the language spoken at home, outside home, in its choice of
newspapers, and TV channels. Everyone finds to accomplish its need by the same
way. Example includes the preference of using mobile phones in English. The
satisfactory answer to this tendency may be the lack of finding the
translations in native language---Bengali terms used in current mobile phones
are hard to understand by users. I have investigated various mobile phone
models available in Indian market which have lot of problems in Bengali
interpretation. I have sort out the root cause of this problem to be the
conventional accent understand ability. Depending on this I have created a set
of equivalent terms that I hope to be simpler in use. In this paper I have
performed experiments to compare the new terms to the available ones. Our
findings show that the newly derived terms do better in term of performance
than to current ones. It has also been seen that acceptance of Bengali terms in
mobile phones might grow if the parameter of simpler and conventional accent
understand ability are met while designing."
"Objective: Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leaves affected individuals unable
to ambulate. Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI)
controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like
ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested
a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control
of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).
  Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following
10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking
kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed
to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a
goal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the
KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops
at designated points within the VRE.
  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was
77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),
with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 +/-
1.0 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 +/- 53 sec completion time (perfect =
211 sec). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those
of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions.
  Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode
users' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced
control of ambulation after only a 10-minute training. The ability to achieve
such BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of
future BCI-lower extremity prosthesis systems may be feasible."
"The focus of this report is to initially discuss the concepts WIL and VR,
their main characteristics and current applications. Moreover, the pros and
cons of VWIL are also analyzed. Finally, the report presents some
recommendation including further researches into areas where VWIL has potential
to be successful in the future."
"This paper argues that traditional and mainstream mythologies, which have
been continually told within the Information Technology domain among designers
and advocators of conceptual modelling since the 1960s in different fields of
computing sciences, could now be renovated or substituted in the mould of more
recent discourses about performativity, complexity and end-user creativity that
have been constructed across different fields in the meanwhile. In the paper,
it is submitted that these discourses could motivate IT professionals in
undertaking alternative approaches toward the co-construction of
socio-technical systems, i.e., social settings where humans cooperate to reach
common goals by means of mediating computational tools. The authors advocate
further discussion about and consolidation of some concepts in design research,
design practice and more generally Information Technology (IT) development,
like those of: task-artifact entanglement, universatility (sic) of End-User
Development (EUD) environments, bricolant/bricoleur end-user, logic of
bricolage, maieuta-designers (sic), and laissez-faire method to socio-technical
construction. Points backing these and similar concepts are made to promote
further discussion on the need to rethink the main assumptions underlying IT
design and development some fifty years later the coming of age of software and
modern IT in the organizational domain."
"The main purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of preferences
and their relation to the objective measures in simple direct manipulation
tasks involving both the cognitive process as well as the visually guided
pointing activities. The conducted experiment was concerned with the graphical
structures resembling toolbars widely used in graphical interfaces. The
influence of the graphical panel location, panel configuration as well as the
target size on the user task efficiency and subjects' preferences were
examined. The participants were requested to express their attitudes towards
the tested panels before and after the efficiency examination. This subjective
evaluation was carried out within the framework of Analytic Hierarchy Process
(AHP; Saaty, 1977; 1980). The subjective results that were obtained showed
significant differences in the subjects' preferences towards examined panels
before and after completing the tasks. It seems that the users are able to
comparatively quickly change their minds after gaining some experience with the
investigated stimuli. Additionally, the applied cluster analysis revealed that
the subjects were not homogenous in their opinions, and they formed groups
having similar preference structures."
"The paper is concerned with various ways of analysing the subjective
assessment of displaying digital signage content. In the beginning the brief
description of the signage system evolution is described and next, the carried
out ex-periment is depicted. The preferences of the 32 subjects were obtained
using pairwise comparisons of the designed screen formats. Then the priorities
were derived by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1977; 1980)
framework. The gathered data were modelled and analysed by means of the
analysis of variance, multiple regression, conjoint and factor analysis. The
results suggest that the application of different methods of preference
analysis may provide additional information, which could facilitate more
in-depth understanding of the given preference structure."
"In this paper, results of experimental research on the preattentive mechanism
in the human-computer interaction (HCI) were presented. Fifty four subjects
were asked to find interface elements from various panel structures. The
arrangements were differentiated by their orientation (vertical, horizontal),
colour pattern (ordered, unordered) and object background colours (green-blue,
green-red, blue-red). The main finding of the study generally confirms the
profits provided by the visual preattentive processing of the colour feature in
graphical panel operation efficiency. However, the vertical way of arranging
the items in search layouts resulted in decreasing the preattentive effect
related to the item background colour. In regular, chessboard-like patterns of
different coloured items, the effect of the early vision was less salient than
in the case of structures with randomly dispersed colours. The reported results
can help in designing efficient graphical user-computer interfaces in many
interactive information systems."
"The main objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of a computer
screen interface design and its related geometrical characteristics of 36
graphical objects on a user's task efficiency. A total of 490 subjects took
part in laboratory experiments that focused on the direct manipulation of a
visual dialogue between a user and a computer. The subjects were asked to
select an object from among a group of items randomly placed on the computer
screen that were visible exclusively during the visual search process. A model
expressing the mean object acquisition time as a function of graphical object
size and the configuration was developed and statistically validated. The model
showed an influence of geometrical design characteristics of the graphical
objects (icons) and their groupings (icon structures) on the observed task
efficiency. The reported results can be used at those stages of a software
lifecycle that concentrate on prototyping, designing, and implementing
graphical solutions for the efficient graphical user-computer interface."
"If wood has been with us since time immemorial, being part of our
environment, housing and tools, now wood has gain momentum, as it is clear that
wood improves our life style. Because of the healthiness, resistance, ecology
and comfort, wood is important for all of us, no matter what our life style is.
WOODTOUCH Project aims to open a completely new market for furniture and
interior design companies, enabling touch interaction between the user and
wooden furniture surfaces. Why not switch on or dim the lights touching a
wooden table? Why not turn on the heating system? Why not use wood as a touch
sensitive surface for domotic control? The furniture designed with this novel
technology, offers a wooden outer image and has different touch sensitive areas
over the ones the user is able to control all sorts of electric appliances
touching over a wooden surface."
"The investigation of the browsing behavior of users provides useful
information to optimize web site design, web browser design, search engines
offerings, and online advertisement. This has been a topic of active research
since the Web started and a large body of work exists. However, new online
services as well as advances in Web and mobile technologies clearly changed the
meaning behind ""browsing the Web"" and require a fresh look at the problem and
research, specifically in respect to whether the used models are still
appropriate. Platforms such as YouTube, Netflix or last.fm have started to
replace the traditional media channels (cinema, television, radio) and media
distribution formats (CD, DVD, Blu-ray). Social networks (e.g., Facebook) and
platforms for browser games attracted whole new, particularly less tech-savvy
audiences. Furthermore, advances in mobile technologies and devices made
browsing ""on-the-move"" the norm and changed the user behavior as in the mobile
case browsing is often being influenced by the user's location and context in
the physical world. Commonly used datasets, such as web server access logs or
search engines transaction logs, are inherently not capable of capturing the
browsing behavior of users in all these facets. DOBBS (DERI Online Behavior
Study) is an effort to create such a dataset in a non-intrusive, completely
anonymous and privacy-preserving way. To this end, DOBBS provides a browser
add-on that users can install, which keeps track of their browsing behavior
(e.g., how much time they spent on the Web, how long they stay on a website,
how often they visit a website, how they use their browser, etc.). In this
paper, we outline the motivation behind DOBBS, describe the add-on and captured
data in detail, and present some first results to highlight the strengths of
DOBBS."
"Personal ontologies have been proposed as a means to support the semantic
management of user information. Assuming that a personal ontology system is in
use, new tools have to be developed at user interface level to exploit the
enhanced capabilities offered by the system. In this work, we present an
ontology-based file manager that allows semantic searching on the user's
personal information space. The file manager exploits the ontology relations to
present files associated with specific concepts, proposes new related concepts
to users, and helps them explore the information space and locate the required
file."
"There is a great body of work in the areas of
tele-assistance/tele-collaboration offering novel and effective ways to improve
collaboration between personnel located at a remote mine site and off-site
personnel located in major metropolitan areas. Much of this work involves the
use of high-bandwidth communications or targeted sensory experiences using
large format displays. There are also existing remote access technologies but
these suffer from limited functionality (providing text, voice, video or
one-way desktop sharing), are often poorly supported in the security-conscious
corporate environment and require complicated set up processes. There is
currently no singular piece of remote collaboration technology that is suitable
for the delivery of high-quality planning and scheduling services to clients at
a mining site from a remote operating centre. In response to this issue, as
part of a research and technology development effort between CSIRO and a mining
engineering firm, we have developed a concept of remote mining engineer (RME)
and conducted a functional requirements analysis for delivering mining
engineering services to mine sites remotely. Based on the obtained
requirements, a further study was performed to characterise existing
technologies and to identify the scope for future work in designing and
prototyping a network based system for RME. We report on the method and
findings of this study in this paper."
"Effective communication and strong therapeutic relationships are critical to
successful mental health interventions. For example, in 1957 Carl Rogers, a
pioneer of person-centred therapy, proposed that an empowering relationship
could, in and of itself, create the necessary and sufficient conditions for
positive therapeutic outcomes [1]. Whilst modern psychological theories no
longer favour an exclusive focus on relationships, positive relationships and
the dynamics of client-therapist communication remain cornerstones of mental
health intervention theories. A more recent meta-review concluded that across
all interventions models, irrespective of the theoretical approach, the quality
of the relationship between therapists and clients is the second leading
determinant of successful clinical outcomes [2]. Over the past ten years we
(David Coyle and Gavin Doherty) have designed and evaluated a wide range to
systems that provide support for psychological (or talk- based) mental health
interventions [3]. Here we briefly consider two recent examples. In each case
our aim was to enhance communication and reshape clinical practice in a manner
that empowers patients. gNats Island is a computer game that supports
face-to-face interventions for adolescents [4]. MindBalance is an online
treatment programme for adults experiencing difficulties with depression [5]."
"In cognitive neuroscience the sense of agency is defined as the as the
experience of controlling ones own actions and, through this control, affecting
the external world. At CHI 2012 I presented a paper entitled I did that!
Measuring Users Experience of Agency in their own Actions [1]. This extended
abstract draws heavily on that paper, which described an implicit measure
called intentional binding. This measure, developed by researchers in cognitive
neuroscience, has been shown to provide a robust implicit measure for the sense
of agency. My interest in intentional binding stemmed from prior HCI
literature, (e.g. the work of Shneiderman) which emphasises the importance of
the sense of control in human-computer interactions. The key question behind
the CHI 2012 paper was: can we apply intention binding to provide an implicit
measure for the experience of control in human-computer interactions? In
investigating this question, replication was a key element of the experimental
process."
"Web accessibility is actually the most important aspect for providing access
to information and interaction for people with disabilities. However, it seems
that the ability of users with disabilities to navigate over the Web is not
dependent on the graphical complexity, but on the markup used to create the
structure of the website. Consequently, it is necessary to design some software
assistants to help all users to mark themselves in space during a navigation
session. In this paper, we propose an assistant for browsing on the Internet to
allow user to get one s bearings within Web navigation. We describe our
approach which puts at the disposal of the user a visited site map, thus giving
an explicit representation of virtual space. Different levels of visualization
are implemented in order to make the map more visible and less overloaded."
"The standard QWERTY keyboard was developed in the late 1800s for the
typewriters. As people were acquainted with that the same layout was retained
for the computer keyboards. Many people feel that the QWERTY layout is not very
efficient layout and there have been many inventions on different layouts of
character keys.
  In order to improve the key arrangement, two major issues should be
addressed. (i) The improved key arrangement should offer significantly improved
productivity. (ii) The training time for learning the improved key arrangement
should be minimized.
  This article analyzes 10 inventions from US patent database each of which
have proposed a new layout giving us some specific advantage. The inventions
try to achieve one or more of the following advantages, viz., to reduce finger
movements during typing, to achieve speed in data entry, to reduce errors in
typing, making keyboard easy to learn, making easy for children to find keys,
reduce stress in hands and finger and suitability for special purpose
computers."
"A keyboard is the most important input device for a computer. With the
development of technology a basic keyboard does not want to remain confined
within the basic functionalities of a keyboard, rather it wants to go beyond.
There are several inventions which attempt to improve the efficiency of a
conventional keyboard.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions from US Patent database all of which
have proposed very interesting methods for improving the efficiency of a
computer keyboard. Some interesting inventions include, adding toolbar buttons
on the keyboard, power saving method, keyboard-cooling mechanism, robust
keyboard for public use, keyboard enhancement for children`s use.
  Each of these inventions have been analyzed from TRIZ perspective, in many
cases formulating the Ideal Final Result, contradictions and highlighting the
Inventive Principles used in the solution."
"Although the primary objective of the keyboard to input data into the
computer, the advanced keyboards keep various other things in mind, such as,
how to use the same keyboard for various other purposes, or how to use the same
keyboard efficiently by using various other attachments to the keyboard. This
objective led to various inventions on keyboard attachments, some of which are
illustrated below in this article.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on various keyboard attachments from
US patent database. Each different attachment improves the usability of the
keyboard in some way or other. Some attachments illustrated are template
holders, paper holders, pointing device attachments, mouse pad attachments,
wrist rest attachments, storage device attachments, and multimedia attachments."
"A computer keyboard consists of several sections and each section consists of
several numbers of keys. The text entry section contains the standard character
keys, navigation section contains cursor movement and page control keys,
numeric keypad contains numeric keys and function keys section contain function
keys and special keys. Although the increased number of keys helps smooth
interaction with a computer there are situations where it is necessary to
reduce the number of keys.
  The need for reducing number of keys in a keyboard creates a technical
contradiction. Generally more number of keys can support more number of
functions and less number of keys can support less number of functions. We need
more number of functions (all the functions available in a full size keyboard),
but we want only less number of keys (Contradiction). This contradiction has
been solved by using multi-stroke mechanism.
  There may be different purposes to reduce the number of keys in a keyboard.
Some of them intend to reduce the size of the keyboard while some others intend
to increase the speed of typing. But all of these inventions use multi-stroke
mechanism to generate more number of signals from less number of keys."
"The soft keyboards are onscreen representation of physical keyboard having
alphanumeric characters and other controls. The user operates the soft keyboard
with the mouse, a stylus or other pointing device. The soft keys dont have any
mechanical component.
  The soft keyboards are used in many public places for informational purpose,
educational systems and financial transactional systems. A soft keyboard is
convenient in some cases where a hard keyboard is difficult to manage. The soft
keyboard is a substitute of a physical keyboard and is displayed on the screen.
It displays the same type of alphanumeric and control keys like the keys on the
actual keyboard.
  There are many inventions on a soft keyboard which makes the soft keyboard
more efficient and effective. This article illustrates some inventions on soft
keyboards from US patent database."
"The conventional computers are not usable in dark, as the user cannot see the
keyboard to operate properly. But there are many situations where the user may
like to work on his computer under low light conditions, such as, during
nights, while traveling in flights/ trains having low lights, working in the
garden during evening etc. So it is necessary to provide some light to the
laptop to operate the keyboard under low light situations.
  Luminescence of the keyboard is a desirable feature for portable computers.
There may be several methods to illuminate the keyboard, the most crude may be
carrying an external light and fixing at a point where it can light the
keyboard. But solutions like this are not very convenient. The inventors have
been looking for better solutions. This article analyses 6 patents on keyboard
illumination.
  A good illumination system do not consume more battery, do not increase the
size and weight of the laptop, do not increase heat inside the laptop box, and
do not cost much to manufacture. The light should uniformly illuminate the
whole keyboard and should not throw light on other areas that are not required."
"Haptic technology, or haptics, is a tactile feedback technology which takes
advantage of a user's sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, and/or
motions upon the user. This mechanical stimulation may be used to assist in the
creation of virtual objects (objects existing only in a computer simulation),
for control of such virtual objects, and for the enhancement of the remote
control of machines and devices. It has been described as for the sense of
touch what computer graphics does for vision. Although haptic devices are
capable of measuring bulk or reactive forces that are applied by the user, it
should not be confused with touch or tactile sensors that measure the pressure
or force exerted by the user to the interface."
"With the prolific growth in usage of smartphones across the spectrum of
people in the society it becomes mandatory to handle and configure these
devices effectively to achieve optimum results from it. This paper proposes a
context sensitive model termed COSMOS (COntext Sensitive MOdel for Smartphones)
for configuring the smartphones using multifactor analysis with the help of
decision trees. The COSMOS model proposed in this paper facilitates the
configuration of various smartphone settings implicitly based on the user's
current context, without interrupting the user for various inputs. The COSMOS
model also proposes multiple context parameters like location, scheduler data,
recent call log settings etc to decide the appropriate settings for the
smartphones. The proposed model is validated by a prototype implementation in
the Android platform. Various tests were conducted in the implementation and
the settings relevancy metric value of 90.95% confirms the efficiency of the
proposed model."
"In this paper, we present our novel contribution methodology based on the
results of case study that has been implemented in our research environment to
test with new technique the usability of both intelligent Android and Apple
phones. This analysis of the case study stands for features similar to
applications, operating system, hardware and software structure, battery life,
and online based websites. Multiple interrogations were applied to collect user
answers ongoing features. Users directly react by responding based on their
daily used product experience. Consequently, the estimation is based on the
data that has been unregistered from the user. The most recent results will end
up by introducing a combination of ideal features on both products to build a
wonderful extended product in the future."
"Lead user driven innovation and open innovation paradigms seek to involve
consumers and common people to innovative product development projects. In
order to help developers choose ideas that meet the end users' needs, we
undertook a massive collaborative research effort and collected 40000 ideas
from 2150 common people about future mobile services that they would like to
use. We inspired each people to produce tens of mobile service ideas. In this
paper we carry out an analysis for 4000 ideas from the idea database. We had a
particular interest in whether peoples' ideas can be used in foreseeing the
technology development needs. The results show that end users produce ideas
that are conservative more than novel. Therefore, we claim that consumers'
technology foresight horizon is limited by the existing technological base. The
second finding, linked to the previous one, is that the great majority of the
ideas that consumers expressed could be realised utilizing existing
technologies. The implication of this finding is that the idea database should
be an interesting source of ideas for service developers. The third finding of
the study, related to the methodology, is that a vast number of ideas can be
collected fairly easily but analyzing them cost effectively is a challenge."
"We present a testbed for exploring novel smart refrigerator interactions, and
identify three key adoption-limiting interaction shortcomings of
state-of-the-art smart fridges: lack of 1) user experience focus, 2)
low-intrusion object recognition and 2) automatic item position detection. Our
testbed system addresses these limitations by a combination of sensors,
software filters, architectural components and a RESTful API to track
interaction events in real-time, and retrieve current state and historical data
to learn patterns and recommend user actions. We evaluate the accuracy and
overhead of our system in a realistic interaction flow. The accuracy was
measured to 83-88% and the overhead compared to a representative
state-of-the-art barcode scanner improved by 27%. We also showcase two
applications built on top of our testbed, one for finding expired items and
ingredients of dishes; and one to monitor your health. The pattern that these
applications have in common is that they cast the interaction as an
item-recommendation problem triggered when the user takes something out. Our
testbed could help reveal further user-experience centric interaction patterns
and new classes of applications for smart fridges that inherently, by relying
on our testbed primitives, mitigate the issues with existing approaches."
"Recreation of flight trajectory is important among research areas. The design
of a flight trajectory recreation and playback system is presented in this
paper. Rather than transferring the flight data to diagram, graph and table,
flight data is visualized on the 3D global of ossimPlanet. ossimPlanet is an
open-source 3D global geo-spatial viewer and the system realization is based on
analysis it. Users are allowed to choose their interested flight of aerial
mission. The aerial photographs and corresponding configuration files in which
flight data is included would be read in. And the flight statuses would be
stored. The flight trajectory is then recreated. Users can view the photographs
and flight trajectory marks on the correct positions of 3D global. The scene
along flight trajectory is also simulated at the plane's eye point. This paper
provides a more intuitive way for recreation of flight trajectory. The cost is
decreased remarkably and security is ensured by secondary development on
open-source platform."
"The mechanism of communication between users and devices is called interface.
From time to time changes in interface significantly improve our work with
computers even without any serious changes in programs themselves. Main ideas
in PCs interface were introduced many years ago and since then there are no
significant changes, while new devices show promising ways by using direct
manipulation of screen objects. Users' direct action with all the screen
objects of our ordinary PCs turns standard screens into touch screens of very
high resolution and not only changes the interface of familiar programs but
creates the new type of programs: user-driven applications."
"Keyboard, although a popular medium, is not very convenient as it requires a
certain amount of skill for effective usage. A mouse on the other hand requires
a good hand-eye co-ordination. Also current computer interfaces also assume a
certain level of literacy from the user. It also expect the user to have
certain level of proficiency in English. In our country where the literacy
level is as low as 50% in some states, if information technology has to reach
the grass root level; these constraints have to be eliminated. As a solution
for these, Speech Recognition and hence the concept of Voice operated computer
system comes into picture. In this paper we propose a technique to develop a
voice recognition system which will be used for controlling computer via speech
input from any user i.e. without the use of mouse and / or keyboard. Once
developed this system would be of great benefit to physically handicapped
people as Instead of scrolling through written procedures on a laptop or
handheld computer, they can wear a headset and have their hands and eyes free."
"In this paper a concept for hardware realization of graphic tactile display
for visually impaired peoples is presented. For realization of tactile
actuators bi-stable, solenoids and PIC based control board are used. The
selected algorithm for series activation of each row of display allows using
minimal number of active components to set and reset the solenoids. Finally, a
program algorithm of control board is discussed. The project is funded by
Bulgarian National Science Fund NSF Grant D ID 02 14, 2009 2013"
"In decision making a key source of uncertainty is people's perception of
information which is influenced by their attitudes toward risk. Both,
perception of information and risk attitude, affect the interpretation of
information and hence the choice of suitable courses of action in a variety of
contexts ranging from project planning to military operations. Visualization
associated with the dynamics of cognitive states of people processing
information and making decision is therefore not only important for analysis
but has also significant practical applications, in particular in the military
command and control domain. In this paper, we focus on a major concept that
affect human cognition in this context: reliability of information. We
introduce Cognitive Move Diagrams (CMD)---a simple visualization tool---to
represent and evaluate the impact of this concept on decision making. We
demonstrate through both a hypothetical example and a subject matter expert
based experiment that CMD are effective in visualizing, detecting and
qualifying human biases."
"Lack of proper English pronunciations is a major problem for immigrant
population in developed countries like U.S. This poses various problems,
including a barrier to entry into mainstream society. This paper presents a
research study that explores the use of speech technologies merged with
activity-based and arcade-based games to do pronunciation feedback for Hispanic
children within the U.S. A 3-month long study with immigrant population in
California was used to investigate and analyze the effectiveness of computer
aided pronunciation feedback through games. In addition to quantitative
findings that point to statistically significant gains in pronunciation
quality, the paper also explores qualitative findings, interaction patterns and
challenges faced by the researchers in dealing with this community. It also
describes the issues involved in dealing with pronunciation as a competency."
"We begin by considering the expectations of the creators of VisiCalc, the
first spreadsheet. The emphasis is on the nature of the spreadsheet grid. The
grid is taken as a presentational method for showing a solution to a Sudoku
puzzle. We consider methods or approaches for the solution. We look at the
relationship between this model and academic papers on the methods for
describing and categorising end-user models generally. We consider whether the
type of model described here should be categorised separately. The complexity
of the model is reviewed in the context of commendations to minimise overly
sophisticated presentational constructs and formulae."
"It has been reported that virtual reality can be a useful tool for ergonomics
study. The proposed integrated simulation system aims at measuring operator's
performance in an interactive way for 2D control panel design. By incorporating
some sophisticated virtual reality hardware/software, the system allows natural
human-system and/or human-human interaction in a simulated virtual environment;
enables dynamic objective measurement of human performance; and evaluates the
quality of the system design in human factors perspective based on the
measurement. It can also be for operation training for some 2D control panels."
"A preliminary experimental study is presented, that aims at eliciting the
contribution of oral messages to facilitating visual search tasks on crowded
visual displays. Results of quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that
appropriate verbal messages can improve both target selection time and
accuracy. In particular, multimodal messages including a visual presentation of
the isolated target together with absolute spatial oral information on its
location in the displayed scene seem most effective. These messages also got
top-ranking ratings from most subjects."
"Input multimodality combining speech and hand gestures has motivated numerous
usability studies. Contrastingly, issues relating to the design and ergonomic
evaluation of multimodal output messages combining speech with visual
modalities have not yet been addressed extensively. The experimental study
presented here addresses one of these issues. Its aim is to assess the actual
efficiency and usability of oral system messages including brief spatial
information for helping users to locate objects on crowded displays rapidly.
Target presentation mode, scene spatial structure and task difficulty were
chosen as independent variables. Two conditions were defined: the visual target
presentation mode (VP condition) and the multimodal target presentation mode
(MP condition). Each participant carried out two blocks of visual search tasks
(120 tasks per block, and one block per condition). Scene target presentation
mode, scene structure and task difficulty were found to be significant factors.
Multimodal target presentation proved to be more efficient than visual target
presentation. In addition, participants expressed very positive judgments on
multimodal target presentations which were preferred to visual presentations by
a majority of participants. Besides, the contribution of spatial messages to
visual search speed and accuracy was influenced by scene spatial structure and
task difficulty: (i) messages improved search efficiency to a lesser extent for
2D array layouts than for some other symmetrical layouts, although the use of
2D arrays for displaying pictures is currently prevailing; (ii) message
usefulness increased with task difficulty. Most of these results are
statistically significant."
"Position control devices enable precise selection, but significant clutching
degrades performance. Clutching can be reduced with high control-display gain
or pointer acceleration, but there are human and device limits. Elastic rate
control eliminates clutching completely, but can make precise selection
difficult. We show that hybrid position-rate control can outperform position
control by 20% when there is significant clutching, even when using pointer
acceleration. Unlike previous work, our RubberEdge technique eliminates
trajectory and velocity discontinuities. We derive predictive models for
position control with clutching and hybrid control, and present a prototype
RubberEdge position-rate control device including initial user feedback."
"[Spreadsheet] Models are invaluable tools for strategic planning. Models help
key decision makers develop a shared conceptual understanding of complex
decisions, identify sensitivity factors and test management scenarios.
Different modelling approaches are specialist areas in themselves. Model
development can be onerous, expensive, time consuming, and often bewildering.
It is also an iterative process where the true magnitude of the effort, time
and data required is often not fully understood until well into the process.
This paper explores the traditional approaches to strategic planning modelling
commonly used in organisations and considers the application of a real-options
approach to match and benefit from the increasing uncertainty in today's
rapidly changing world."
"Amongst the large number of write-and-throw-away spreadsheets developed for
one-time use there is a rather neglected proportion of spreadsheets that are
huge, periodically used, and submitted to regular update-cycles like any
conventionally evolving valuable legacy application software. However, due to
the very nature of spreadsheets, their evolution is particularly tricky and
therefore error-prone. In our strive to develop tools and methodologies to
improve spreadsheet quality, we analysed consolidation spreadsheets of an
internationally operating company for the errors they contain. The paper
presents the results of the field audit, involving 78 spreadsheets with 60,446
non-empty cells. As a by-product, the study performed was also to validate our
analysis tools in an industrial context. The evaluated auditing tool offers the
auditor a new view on the formula structure of the spreadsheet by grouping
similar formulas into equivalence classes. Our auditing approach defines three
similarity criteria between formulae, namely copy, logical and structural
equivalence. To improve the visualization of large spreadsheets, equivalences
and data dependencies are displayed in separated windows that are interlinked
with the spreadsheet. The auditing approach helps to find irregularities in the
geometrical pattern of similar formulas."
"The difference between surface and deep structures of a spreadsheet is a
major cause of difficulty in checking spreadsheets. After a brief survey of
current methods of checking (or debugging) spreadsheets, new visual methods of
showing the deep structures are presented. Illustrations are given on how these
visual methods can be employed in various interactive local and global
debugging strategies."
"There is an overlooked iceberg of problems in end user computing.
Spreadsheets are developed by people who are very skilled in their main job
function, be it finance, procurement, or production planning, but often have
had no formal training in spreadsheet use. IT auditors focus on mainstream
information systems but regard spreadsheets as user problems, outside their
concerns. Internal auditors review processes, but not the tools that support
decision making in these processes.
  This paper highlights the gaps between risk management and end user awareness
in spreadsheet research. In addition the potential benefits of software agent
technologies to the management of risk in spreadsheets are explored. This paper
discusses the current research into end user computing and spreadsheet use
awareness."
"The inner views of all our applications are predetermined by the designers;
only some non-significant variations are allowed with the help of adaptive
interface. In several programs you can find some moveable objects, but it is an
extremely rare thing. However, the design of applications on the basis of
moveable and resizable objects opens an absolutely new way of programming; such
applications are much more effective in users' work, because each user can
adjust an application to his purposes. Programs, using adaptive interface, only
implement the designer's ideas of what would be the best reaction to any of the
users' doings or commands. Applications on moveable elements do not have such
predetermined system of rules; they are fully controlled by the users. This
article describes and demonstrates the new way of applications' design."
"Researchers are developing mobile sensing platforms to facilitate public
awareness of environmental conditions. However, turning such awareness into
practical community action and political change requires more than just
collecting and presenting data. To inform research on mobile environmental
sensing, we conducted design fieldwork with government, private, and public
interest stakeholders. In parallel, we built an environmental air quality
sensing system and deployed it on street sweeping vehicles in a major U.S.
city; this served as a ""research vehicle"" by grounding our interviews and
affording us status as environmental action researchers. In this paper, we
present a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action,
focusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological
interventions."
"This paper examines two parallel case studies to promote remote medical
consultation in Ghana. These projects, initiated independently by different
researchers in different organizations, both deployed ICT solutions in the same
medical community in the same year. The Ghana Consultation Network currently
has over 125 users running a Web-based application over a delay-tolerant
network of servers. OneTouch MedicareLine is currently providing 1700 doctors
in Ghana with free mobile phone calls and text messages to other members of the
medical community. We present the consequences of (1) the institutional context
and identity of the investigators, as well as specific decisions made with
respect to (2) partnerships formed, (3) perceptions of technological
infrastructure, and (4) high-level design decisions. In concluding, we discuss
lessons learned and high-level implications for future ICTD research agendas."
"The old Bulgarian keyboard standard BDS 5237-78 was developed for use mostly
on typewriter machines. The wide distribution of the computers forced the
update of this standard. On one hand this is because of the need to support
symbols such as the Bulgarian quotation marks, the Cyrillic letter I with grave
accent, the long dash, etc. On the other hand the so called ""phonetic layout""
became popular and this layout is not standartized by BDS. In this work we are
analyzing the possibilities to improve the keyboard layout according to BDS
5237-78, as well as the traditional phonetic layout. At the same time we are
making a comparison with the new proposed Bulgarian keyboard layout standard
BDS 5237:2006. We are proposing an algorithm for placement of additional
symbols on the keys of the keyboard in a way that makes easy for the users to
find the symbols even when they are not inscripted on the keys. We are giving
formal definitions and illustrations of four keyboard layouts - three extended
keyboard layouts for typing in ""Cyrillic"" mode (BDS, traditional phonetic and
phonetic according to the new proposed BDS 5237:2006) and one extended layout
for typing in ""Latin"" mode."
"Very little has been explored about the narrative as a process when
constructing entertainment for interactive media. Simultaneously, the interest
in narrative vehicles increases while certain occupations, seeing the narrative
as a structure, obscure the examination of the process of selecting, arranging
and rendering story material. To correct this deficiency, a method for a
narrative bridging that encourages research and design while exploring
narration as a process, is proposed with the aim to not diminish the properties
of the interactive media. This method focuses on the initial phase where
establishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation
that precedes its systematization and computation. The aim is to give designers
a comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with
creativity, and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between
narration, spatiality and interactivity. The method aided the practise of a
discipline that was established through a qualitative study conducted as part
of a university course in rapid prototyping. The results demonstrated that the
method aided time-constrained design processes, simultaneously detecting
inconsistencies that would prevent the team from making improvements. The
method gave the team a shared vocabulary and outlook, allowing them to progress
without interfering with the creative flow. This enabled the team to reason
about the process and easily advice design stakeholders. The study also
provides directions for future developments within research of narrative
processes in game design."
"The goal of this paper is to offer a full support for universities and
quality assessment committees in retrieving the feedback from their students
regarding to their teaching staff. The computer based application presented
before ([Cri07]) collects data from the students. Another part of the
application, presented in this paper, processes this data and presents the
statistical results concerning each teacher."
"We conducted a qualitative user study with 77 consumers to investigate what
social aspects are relevant when supporting customers during their shopping
activities and particularly in situations when they are undecided. Twenty-five
respondents (32%) reported seeking extra information on web pages and forums,
in addition to asking their peers for advice (related to the nature of the item
to be bought). Moreover, from the remaining 52 subjects, only 6 (8%) were
confident enough to make prompt comparisons between items and an immediate
purchasing choice, while 17 respondents (22%) expressed the need for being away
from persuasive elements. The remaining 29 respondents (38%) reported having a
suboptimal strategy for making their shopping decisions (i.e. buying all items,
not buying, or choosing randomly). Therefore, the majority of our participants
(70% = 32% + 38%) had social and information needs when making purchasing
decisions. This result motivates the development of applications that would
allow consumers to ask shopping questions to their social network while
on-the-go."

"WebNC is a system for efficiently sharing, retrieving and viewing web
applications. Unlike existing screencasting and screensharing tools, WebNC is
optimized to work with web pages where a lot of scrolling happens. WebNC uses a
tile-based encoding to capture, transmit and deliver web applications, and
relies only on dynamic HTML and JavaScript. The resulting webcasts require very
little bandwidth and are viewable on any modern web browser including Firefox
and Internet Explorer as well as browsers on the iPhone and Android platforms."
"This text presents a cognitive-psychology analysis of spontaneous, co-speech
gestures in a face-to-face architectural design meeting (A1 in DTRS7). The
long-term objective is to formulate specifications for remote
collaborative-design systems, especially for supporting the use of different
semiotic modalities (multi-modal interaction). According to their function for
design, interaction, and collaboration, we distinguish different gesture
families: representational (entity designating or specifying), organisational
(management of discourse, interaction, or functional design actions),
focalising, discourse and interaction modulating, and disambiguating gestures.
Discussion and conclusion concern the following points. It is impossible to
attribute fixed functions to particular gesture forms. ""Designating"" gestures
may also have a design function. The gestures identified in A1 possess a
certain generic character. The gestures identified are neither systematically
irreplaceable, nor optional accessories to speech or drawing. We discuss the
possibilities for gesture in computer-supported collaborative software systems.
The paper closes on our contribution to gesture studies and cognitive design
research."
"In this paper we tried to focus on some of the problems with the mobile
keypad and text entering in these devices, and tried to give some possible
suggestions. We mainly took some of the basic Human Computer Interaction
principles and some general issues into consideration."
"In this paper, we introduce a tilting interface that controls direction based
applications in ubiquitous environments. A tilt interface is useful for
situations that require remote and quick interactions or that are executed in
public spaces. We explored the proposed tilting interface with different
application types and classified the tilting interaction techniques. Augmenting
objects with sensors can potentially address the problem of the lack of
intuitive and natural input devices in ubiquitous environments. We have
conducted an experiment to test the usability of the proposed tilting interface
to compare it with conventional input devices and hand gestures. The experiment
results showed greater improvement of the tilt gestures in comparison with hand
gestures in terms of speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction."
"The automobile is always a point of interest where new technology has been
deployed. Because of this interest, human-vehicle interaction has been an
appealing area for much research in recent years. The current in-vehicle design
has been improved but still possesses some of the design from the traditional
interaction style. In this paper, we propose a new user-oriented model for
in-vehicle interaction model known as i-Interaction. The i-Interaction model
provides user with an intuitive approach to interact with the In-Vehicle
Information System (IVIS) by the keypad entry. It is the intent that the
proposed usability testing for this model will help improve the way research
and development is implemented from this topic. This model does not only
provide the user with a direct interaction in vehicles but also introduce a new
prospective that other research has not addressed."
"Designing human computer interaction interface is an important and a complex
task, but it could be simplified by decomposing task into subcomponents and
maintaining relationships among those subcomponents. Task decomposition is a
structured approach, applicable in both Software Engineering and Human Computer
Interaction (HCI) fields depending on specific processes and design artifacts.
Using design artifacts applications could be made for analysis and design by
making the hand draw sketches to provide high level of logical design based on
user requirements, usage scenarios and essential use cases. To design hand draw
sketches there are some strategies to be followed .i.e., planning, sequential
work flow, and levels of details. In this research paper we are presenting
design artifacts, goals, principles, guidelines and currently faced problems to
human computer interaction design community. Moreover in the end concluded with
assessed observations in a case study."
"Designing and implementing an intelligent and user friendly human machine
interface for any kind of software or hardware oriented application is always
be a challenging task for the designers and developers because it is very
difficult to understand the psychology of the user, nature of the work and best
suit of the environment. This research paper is basically about to propose an
intelligent, flexible and user friendly machine interface for Product Life
Cycle Management products or PDM Systems since studies show that usability and
human computer interaction issues are a major cause of acceptance problems
introducing or using such systems. Going into details of the proposition, we
present prototype implementations about theme based on design requirements,
designed designs and technologies involved for the development of human machine
interface."
"This paper introduces real time inverse arithmetic coding and user interfaces
based thereupon. The main idea is that information-efficient data entry can be
achieved by ensuring that each input's associated display space and ease of
selection are at all times related to the input's probability of being
selected. As with data entry based on inverse arithmetic coding, the layout
initially depends on the probabilities of the possible inputs; however, real
time inverse arithmetic coding differs in that the user's actions are
interpreted not to navigate this probability distribution but rather to modify
it according to a learned update rule, which approximates the conditioning of
the probability distribution on the user's actions. Potential applications of
real time inverse arithmetic coding include text entry, file browsing,
integrated multi-program user interfaces, assistive technologies for users with
movement disabilities, and ergonomic input methods."
"The objective of this paper is to present a Mixed Reality System (MRS) for
rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. The system answers the following
challenges: (i) increase motivation of patients by making the training a
personalized experience; (ii) take into account patients' impairments by
offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities; (iii) make it
possible to therapists to track patient's activities and to evaluate/track
their progress; (iv) open opportunities for telemedicine and tele
rehabilitation; (v) and provide an economically acceptable system by reducing
both equipment and management costs. In order to test this system a pilot study
has been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital in order to understand
the potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists
who 'played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional
rehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another
using a mixed reality version of the same game were held. Results have shown
the MRS and the PC game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation."
"This book is about the transformation of screen objects into movable and
resizable and about the design of applications entirely on the basis of such
elements. The screen objects have a wide variety of shapes; they can be either
graphical objects or controls; there are solitary objects and very complex
objects parts of which are involved in individual, synchronous, and related
movements. Objects can be involved in forward movements and rotation; they can
be resized and reconfigured; all these movements and situations are considered.
On the basis of total movability, the new type of programs - user-driven
applications - are designed. These applications continue to work according to
their main purposes, but the whole control of WHAT, WHEN, and HOW must appear
on the screen is passed from designers to users."
"A variety of applications are emerging to support streaming video from mobile
devices. However, many tasks can benefit from streaming specific content rather
than the full video feed which may include irrelevant, private, or distracting

variety of automatic and interactive techniques to identify and segment desired
content in the camera view, allowing the user to publish a more focused video."

"This paper describes a system for supporting coarse-grained location-based
synchronisation. This type of synchronisation may occur when people need only
some awareness about the location of others within the specific context of an
on-going activity. We have identified a number of reference scenarios for this
type of synchronisation and we have implemented and deployed a prototype to
evaluate the type of support provided. The results of the evaluation suggest a
good acceptance of the overall concept, indicating that this might be a
valuable approach for many of the indicated scenarios, possibly replacing or
complementing existing synchronisation practices."
"With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home
care, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of
the household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants
(users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive
applications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in
diverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The
core challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess
occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according
to the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive
computing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right
information and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a
context-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most
important component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level
description of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the
model multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge.
Based on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach
using CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task
recognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing.
Moreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is
also discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task
supporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle
and environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results
of the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good
efficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity
inference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life."
"The goal of video games is to challenge and entertain the players. Successful
video games deliver experience that impact players on a level of arousal.
Therefore undertaking a user experience (UX) study is crucial to ensure that a
game achieves both critical and financial success. However, traditional
usability methods (observation, subjective reporting, questionnaire, and
interview) have a number of limitations on game user research. In this study we
capture player's physiological measures during a gameplay session, to indicate
micro-events that have caused changes in their body signals. At the
post-gameplay interviews we ask participants to comment and describe their
feelings on the selected events. The aim of this study is not to over-interpret
physiological measures, but on using blips in measures to help identify key
points in a game, which we then use to investigate further with the
participant. This approach provides a method that can identify not only the
negative user experience and usability issues but also the events which have a
positive impact on player's experience."
"This paper describes a system to support the visual exploration of Open Data.
During his/her interactive experience with the graphics, the user can easily
store the current complete state of the visualization application (called a
viewpoint). Next, he/she can compose sequences of these viewpoints (called
scenarios) that can easily be reloaded. This feature allows to keep traces of a
former exploration process, which can be useful in single user (to support
investigation carried out in multiple sessions) as well as in collaborative
setting (to share points of interest identified in the data set)."
"In global economy, turbulent organization environment strongly influences
organization's operation. Organizations must constantly adapt to changing
circumstances and search for new possibilities of gaining competitive
advantage. To face this challenge, small organizations base their operation on
collaboration within Virtual Organizations (VOs). VO operation is based on
collaborative processes. Due to dynamism and required flexibility of
collaborative processes, existing business information systems are insufficient
to efficiently support them. In this paper a novel method for supporting
collaborative processes based on process mining techniques is proposed. The
method allows activity patterns in various instances of collaborative processes
to be identified and used for recommendation of activities. This provides an
opportunity for better computer support of collaborative processes leading to
more efficient and effective realization of business goals."
"Emotion can be expressed in many ways that can be seen such as facial
expression and gestures, speech and by written text. Emotion Detection in text
documents is essentially a content - based classification problem involving

techniques used in emotion detection are discussed."
"Before the computer age, games were played in the physical world where
players would have to interact with real objects and each other, triggering a
series of emotions. Nowadays, the computer games have become one of the most
popular forms of entertainment due to their high-level of attraction and
accessibility. However, the game industry is always trying to find new ways of
making games more interactive and exciting in order to attract new players, and
one of the recent trends on the area of human-computer interaction is
Biofeedback.
  The goal of this dissertation is to study different approaches on the use of
indirect biofeedback within videogames, with the purpose of creating a better
human-computer interaction, and provide a more appealing and immersive user
experience. For this, we focused on the development of a framework capable of
testing different indirect biofeedback models within a specified game, in order
to assess the effect of each of these variations on the user experience. This
framework is game independent, with the intention of being used on further
studies."
"A conventional computer keyboard consists of as many as 101 keys. The
keyboard has several sections, such as text entry section, navigation section,
and numeric keypad etc. and each having several keys on the keyboard.
  The size of the keyboard is a major inconvenience for portable computers, as
they cannot be carried easily. Thus there are certain circumstances which
compels to reduce the size of a keyboard.
  Reducing the size of a keyboard leads to several problems. A reduced size
keyboard may not contain all the keys available on a full size keyboard; a
reduced size keyboard may not be convenient to operate, a reduced size keyboard
may have a different key layout which is difficult to learn etc.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on reducing the size of the keyboard.
Various inventions have attempted to solve the contradictions so that the user
achieves the benefits of both ""reduced size"" and ""typing comfort""."
"As the structure of Chinese characters are very different, it is very
difficult to input Chinese characters into computer quickly and conveniently.
The conventional keyboard does not support the pictorial characters in Chinese
language. There are 3000 to 6000 commonly used pictorial Chinese characters
(Hanzi).
  There are a few existing systems which include ""PinYin"" (phonetic) system, a
combination of the PinYin system and character form techniques, whole character
encoding, stroke input encoding, and stoke form encoding. Each of the methods
have their own advantages and disadvantages. This article describes two
inventions on inputting Chinese language through a standard keyboard."
"The most commonly used Japanese alphabets are Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana.
The Kanji alphabet includes pictographs or ideographic characters that were
adopted from the Chinese alphabet. Hiragana is used to spell words of Japanese
origin, while Katakana is used to spell words of western or other foreign
origin.
  Two methods are commonly used to input Japanese to the computer. One, the
'kana input method' that uses a keyboard having 46 Japanese iroha (or kana)
letter keys. The other method is 'Roma-ji input method', where the Japanese
letters are composed of English input from a standard QWERTY keyboard. Both the
methods have their advantages and disadvantages.
  This article analyses two inventions on inputting Japanese language through a
computer keyboard. One invention uses a standard English keyboard to input
Japanese characters, the other invention uses a standard mobile phone key board
to input the Japanese characters."
"The key switches of the keyboard of a computer system are generally comprised
of a key cap having a plunger, conductive rubber disposed above a membrane
circuit and compressed by the plunger to trigger the membrane circuit causing
it to produce an electric signal to the computer.
  Some key switches use springs. Some other keyboards use rubber domes or a
dome sheet, which do the function of springs. When the user depresses the key
button the spring or domes collapse. The key switch depresses the key stem,
which actuates the button on the membrane circuit. When the user releases the
button the springs or rubber domes push the button up to the rest position.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on different key switch mechanism. The
inventions are selected from US patent database. The inventions try to simplify
the mechanism, reduce manufacturing cost, increase accuracy and reliability,

There is a need to develop special keyboards to meet special requirements.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on special types of keyboards. The
special keyboard are used in special computers or computers used for special

beyond a normal keyboard.
  The example of special keyboards are, a children's keyboard which may be
colorful and attractive, a keyboard in public place need to be more robust, the
keyboard in a palmtop may have less number of keys, the keyboard for a game
station may have special attachments, a multimedia keyboard may have CD ROM and
speakers, a wireless keyboard may have remote control features, a touch

"A keyboard has many function keys and each function key can have multiple
functions when used with control, shift and alt keys, it is difficult for a
user to remember the functionality of the function keys. We need a mechanism to
indicate the operations assigned to each function key for different software
programs. A keyboard guide or template is used for this purpose.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on keyboard key guide and function key
templates selected from US patent database. Various mechanisms of keyboard
templates have been proposed, including static, dynamic, manual, mechanical,
onscreen display and others."
"Although a bigger keyboard is often comfortable to work with, they cannot be
fit into laptop and small size computer boxes. The portable and handheld
computers need small size keyboards. So there is a need to reduce the size of
the keyboard to fit into the laptop box. There are various mechanisms to reduce
the size of the keyboard; collapsible keyboard is one of them.
  Although different inventions intend to achieve the same objective of
reducing the keyboard size, they all differ in their mechanism. For example,
some invention uses a compression mechanism, some invention uses a folding
mechanism, and some invention uses a collapsing mechanism and so on.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on collapsible keyboards from US
patent database. Each case is analyzed from a TRIZ perspective."
"A desktop keyboard has several sections like character key section,
navigation key section, numeric key section, and function key section etc. each

of keyboard to use for various activities. A modular keyboard is designed in
such a way that the components of the keyboard can be attached and detached as
per the need.
  This article illustrates 10 inventions on modular keyboard from US patent
database. The objective of these inventions is to make a keyboard modular, so
that the same keyboard can be made smaller by detaching some of its components
and larger by attaching additional attachments. Some modular keyboards provide
slots for external attachments like mouse, telephone, speakers, joystick and
storage devices etc."
"When users search for the routes between two places using map based services,
these services compute and provide the top candidate routes based on shortest
geometric distances or ideal time consuming. However, other real factors like
physical exertion and practical time consuming will influence user experience,
and the environmental factors like steep slope and traffic jam that result in
these real factors need to be considered. For example, when users travel on
foot or by bicycle, if there are many steep slopes on the routes, it will be
difficult or easy to be tired. In this paper, we propose an approach computing
weighted distance considering these environmental factors. We rank the
candidate route results generated by Google Map using elevation information. We
integrate the elevation information in the route results to assist users to
make decision. The solution can also be used in other scenarios that need to
consider environmental factors."
"The Google Glass is a mobile device designed to be worn as eyeglasses. This
form factor enables new usage possibilities, such as hands-free video chats and
instant web search. However, its shape also hampers its potential: (1) battery
size, and therefore lifetime, is limited by a need for the device to be
lightweight, and (2) high-power processing leads to significant heat, which
should be limited, due to the Glass' compact form factor and close proximity to
the user's skin. We use the Glass in a case study of the power and thermal
characteristics of optical head-mounted display devices. We share insights and
implications to limit power consumption to increase the safety and utility of
head-mounted devices."
"Effectively showing the relationships between objects in a dataset is one of
the main tasks in information visualization. Typically there is a well-defined
notion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as
principal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the
objects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other.
In another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where
related nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also
visualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit
representation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques,
characterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information:
node diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these
three types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different
tasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based
tasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links
and group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and
accuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not
negatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group
diagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions
contradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings.
Taken together, however, such results can have significant implications for the
design of standard and domain specific visualizations tools."
"Touch,face,voice recognition and movement sensors all are part of an emerging
field of computing often called natural user interface, or NUI. Interacting
with technology in these humanistic ways is no longer limited to high tech
secret agents. Gesture Touch, face, voice recognition and movement sensors all
are part of an emerging field of computing often called natural user interface,
or NUI. Interacting with technology in these humanistic ways is no longer
limited to high tech secret agents. Gesture recognition is the process by which
gestures formed by a user are made known to the system. In completely immersive
VR environments, the keyboard is generally not included, Technology
incorporates face, voice, gesture, and object recognition to give users a
variety of ways to interact with the console, all without needing a controller.
This paper focuses on the emerging way of human computer interaction, Gesture
recognition concept and gesture types."
"In this paper we propose an easy algorithm for real time hand finger counting
involving one or more than one hand. Hand finger counting is a simple medium
for Human-Computer Interface which can prove to be a convenient input method
for driving interactive menus, small applications and interactive games. Here,
we also calculate the orientation of the hand which can be used to provide
inputs for the direction and/or speed control of a robot, controlling mouse
cursor or slide-show presentations. If being used by a single person, with his
or her two hands, the person can trigger ten different commands with fingers in
addition to the orientation of the hand. We tried to use very simple algorithm
using very basic mathematics of 2D coordinate geometry and avoided the
conventional use of calculus, contours and convex hull. Anyone seeking for an
easy to implement hand finger counting algorithm can refer to it."
"Recommender systems for TV program have been studied for the realization of
personalized TV Electronic Program Guides. In this paper, we propose automatic
emotion Arabic speech recognition in order to achieve an intelligent remote
control. In addition, the TV can estimate our interests and preferences by
observing our behavior to watch and have a conversation on topics that might be
interesting to us."
"The conflict between vergence (eye movement) and accommodation (crystalline
lens deformation) occurs in every stereoscopic display. It could cause
important stress outside the ""zone of comfort"", when stereoscopic effect is too
strong. This conflict has already been studied using questionnaires, during
viewing sessions of several minutes. The present pilot study describes an
experimental protocol which compares two different comfort conditions using
electroencephalography (EEG) over short viewing sequences. Analyses showed
significant differences both in event-related potentials (ERP) and in frequency
bands power. An uncomfortable stereoscopy correlates with a weaker negative
component and a delayed positive component in ERP. It also induces a power
decrease in the alpha band and increases in theta and beta bands. With fast
responses to stimuli, EEG is likely to enable the conception of adaptive
systems, which could tune the stereoscopic experience according to each viewer."
"The menu is one of the most widely used elements of a graphical user
interface. The objective of a menu system is to provide various commands and
functions to the user in an easy way so that the user can just select the
desired operation from a given list instead of typing a complex command in the
command prompt.
  In a conventional menu system the menu items or options are hard-coded in the
computer program. The programmer or developer composes menu items at the time
of development. The developer tries to include all options that he feels may be
required by the user in future. Although the items are decided from
""requirement analysis"" and other studies, it is difficult to know the exact
need of a user at a future period of time. This leads to inclusion of a lot of
items in the menu, which leads to user confusion and frustration.
  Thus there is a need for adaptable menu that can be changed according to user
requirement. The items of the adaptable menu should change from user to user
and from time to time depending on the program context and likelihood of user
selection.
  This article defines the Ideal Final Result of a dropdown menu system,
defines the desirable functions of an adaptable menu, finds and solves the
contradictions faced in achieving the desirable functions, and illustrates six
selected cases on adaptable menu from US patent database."
"Toolbar is one among the popular elements of a graphical user interface. The
other popular elements of graphical user interface are buttons, menu,
scrollbar, dialog box etc., all of which provide easy access to various
functions of a GUI System.
  A toolbar often does a similar function as the menu but with certain
differences. A menu has the advantage of holding a large number of items
without needing any additional screen space. In contrast, each button on the
toolbar permanently occupies some space on the screen. It is not possible to
implement large number of functions through a toolbar, as they will occupy more
and more valuable screen space. However, the toolbar has an advantage as it
gives a single click access to any function unlike a menu system where the user
has to navigate through sub-menus to ultimate discover the item he is looking
for.
  This article explores the desired features of a toolbar and the ideal
features of an advanced toolbar. The contradictions are described from a TRIZ
perspective and solutions are derived using Inventive principles. Besides the
article illustrates 10 inventions on improving Toolbars selected from US patent
database."
"A command button may contain a textual label or a graphic image or both. It
may be static or animated. There can be many different features to make a
command button attractive and effective. As command button is a typical GUI
element, most improvement on GUI in general will also be applicable to command
buttons. Besides, there are also inventions to improve various aspects of
command buttons in specific. This article illustrates 10 selected inventions
from US patent database. Each invention is followed by a TRIZ based analysis in
brief."
"Scrolling mechanism is used to display and edit large documents in a limited
screen space or window. The scrolling mechanism may include a vertical scroll
bar or a horizontal scroll bar or both to move the contents of the documents up
and down or left and right. There may be navigation buttons on the screen
representing the navigation keys on the keyboard. The user can click these
buttons to scroll the screen.
  There may be very different methods of scrolling such as by using the
""thumb"", as popularly used with a PDF document. Scrolling may be achieved
through eyeball tracking in a hands-free environment where the user does not
have hands or wants to use hands for other activities. This article illustrates
ten interesting inventions on scrolling selected from US patent database."
"The dialog boxes are useful in case of displaying warnings, errors,
confirmations etc. in special situations. A typical dialog box is displayed in
a small window with some text message along with a few options for the user to
select. However, there are certain difficulties associated in programming and
implementing a conventional dialog box, such as, severe programming effort,
rigidity of the hard coded message, obscuring screen space and so on. There is
a need to overcome these difficulties of the dialog box to make them more
efficient and useful.
  The modality of the dialog boxes also creates some limitations. While modal
dialog boxes needs to be closed explicitly by the user, modeless dialog boxes
can grow in number and become difficult to control. Thus, an ideal dialog box
should be deprived of all the above-mentioned drawbacks. The dialog box should
not obscure the screen. The user should be able open multiple dialog boxes but
without obscuring the screen.
  This article analyses 5 interesting inventions on dialog boxes selected from
US Patent database. Each invention tries to overcome some limitations of a
conventional dialog box and provides some innovative features. Each solution is
also analyzed from a TRIZ perspective."
"A tree view or tree navigator is used to display hierarchical data organized
in the form of a tree. In a tree structure there are parent and child nodes.
The child nodes may further have descendants to n levels.
  There are many methods to make the navigation easy. Some of these are
expanding and collapsing branches, splitting the tree, displaying a parent node
in a separate tree, zooming branches, scrolling in various directions etc. It
is still a difficult exercise to handle large trees efficiently. The effort
still continues to manage large number of nodes with faster speed, greater
control, user friendliness and aesthetics.
  This article illustrates five inventions on tree navigators selected from US
patent database. Each of them tries to solve various problems relating to the
tree navigator in different ways. Each invention is also analyzed from a TRIZ
perspective."
"The conventional GUI is more mechanical and does not recognize or communicate
emotions. The modern GUIs are trying to infer the likely emotional state and
personality of the user and communicate through a corresponding emotional
state.
  Emotions are expressed in graphical icons, sounds, pictures and other means.
The emotions are found to be useful in especially in communication software,
interactive learning systems, robotics and other adaptive environments. Various
mechanisms have been developed to express emotions through graphical user
interfaces. This article illustrates some interesting inventions selected from
US patent database."
"A touch sensitive screen displays the information on the screen and also
receives the input by sensing a user's touch on the same screen. This mechanism
facilitates system interaction directly through the screen without needing a
mouse or keyboard. This method has the advantage to make the system compact by
removing keyboard, mouse and similar interactive device.
  However there are certain difficulties to implement a touch screen interface.
The display screens of portable devices are becoming smaller thereby leaving
lesser space for display of data, menu or touch screen interaction. Besides
some screens need to display so much of information that they hardly can afford
any space to display touch screen buttons. This article illustrates various
inventions which have successfully eliminated these difficulties by applying
appropriate Inventive principles."
"Although a GUI largely replaces textual descriptions by graphical icons, the
textual items are not completely removed. The textual items are inevitably used
in window titles, message boxes, help items, menu items and popup items.
Textual items are necessary for communicating messages that are beyond the
limitation of graphical messages.
  However, it is necessary to harness the textual items on the graphical
interface in such a way that they complement each other to produce the best
effect. One has to keep various considerations in mind while applying textual
items in Graphical User Interface. This article illustrates a few inventions on
presenting textual items in a Graphical user Interface."
"Operating a GUI through eyeball is a complex mechanism and not used as often
as mouse or trackball. But there are situations where eye-mouse devices can
play a tremendous role especially where the hands of the user are not available
or busy to perform other activities. The difficulties of implementing an
eye-cursor control system are many. The article illustrates some inventions on
eye-cursor control system, which attempt to eliminate the difficulties of the
prior art mechanisms."
"Voice Recognition (VR) facilitates a human interaction with the machine. VR
may be used to replace the manual task of pushing buttons on a wireless
telephone keypad. This is particularly useful when the hands of the user are
busy with other activities like driving a car.
  However, the VRS system has several limitations. The VRS requires lot of
training and customization in order to be effectively used by individual users
as each individual falls into different voice patterns. Besides the voice
interface is complex and is not as reliable as the keyboard or mouse. This
article illustrates some interesting inventions on using sound and voice in
Graphical User Interfaces."
"Color is an important aspect of any graphical user interface (GUI). Color is
used to make a GUI attractive and meaningful. But there are difficulties in
using colors too. Improper use of color can result in adverse effects. Wrong
colors at wrong place can make the GUI look clumsy and confusing. Apart from
the aesthetics issues there are many other issues involved with colors too.
  One of the contradictions relating to usage of color is ""The color of the GUI
should be customizable to suit user preference. But at the same time it should
not be customizable, as that would cause annoyance and confusion to other
users.""
  Another contraction relating to using color is ""The user should be displayed
all 16 million colors to select the desired color precisely, But from another
angle the user should not be displayed all 16 million colors as that would
create confusion and difficulty in selection.""
  This article analyses some inventions selected from US Patent database and
illustrates how the inventors have been able to solve various contradictions
relating to usage of colors in Graphical User Interface."
"Aesthetics or ""look and feel"" is one of the most important features of any
graphical user interface. Better aesthetics makes the interface user-friendlier
and more popular. Better aesthetics helps the user to understand the meaning of
various components and memorize the navigation paths. A better look and feel
ultimately makes a GUI more efficient and effective. Various methods are
adopted to improve the aesthetics of a GUI, such as, by using colors, using 3D
graphics, using pictorial icons, using sound etc.
  It is important to provide links to all the important features on a desktop
or on a quick access panel. But too many icons or buttons sometimes creates
confusion. Hence it is important to restrict the temptation of putting
everything on the first screen or load the rarely used buttons on the toolbar.
One should ensure that the aesthetics of a GUI is not compromising with its
accessibility and other important features. This article illustrates some
inventions made on GUI aesthetics."
"Selecting an object or element is a fundamental operation in any graphic user
interface. It is necessary to select an object before doing any operation (such
as, dragging, copying, opening, deleting etc.) on that object. The GUI may
provide features to select any single object or even multiple objects. The
feature of selecting multiple objects can provides tremendous power to the GUI
as the user can do complex operations on multiple objects in one go.
  However, the process of selection is not as simple as it appears to the user
of a GUI. The internal logic of a selection mechanism can be very complex in
some situations. The article describes some fundamental difficulties associated
with the selection mechanism, and illustrates the solutions provided by
different inventions selected from US patent database."
"Windows are used quite frequently in a GUI environment. The greatest
advantage of using windows is that each window creates a virtual screen space.
Hence, although the physical screen space is limited to a few inches, use of
windows can create unlimited screen space to display innumerable items.
  The use of windows facilitates the user to open and interact with multiple
programs or documents simultaneously in different windows. Sometimes a single
program may also open multiple windows to display various items. The user can
resize the windows and move their location time to time as desired.
  However, there are several concerns of a window relating to its size,
appearance, positioning, color, visibility, resizability etc. For example, the
window should have a minimum and a maximum size, dragging and resizing the
window should be easy, one window should not be obscured by another window,
windows should adjust their size and location in order to match with the
changes in the resolution and display environment etc.
  This article illustrates six patents from US Patent database solving problems
relating to displaying and resizing of windows. The inventions include
automatic resizing and relocating of windows, alternative modes of displaying
windows to accommodate within the limited display area, combining both spatial
and temporal methods to resize the window, locking and minimizing windows and
making the windows invisible on specific situations."
"This article presents two studies conducted with an affective dialogue system
in which text-based system-user communication was used to model, generate, and
present different affective and social interaction scenarios. We specifically
investigated the influence of interaction context and roles assigned to the
system and the participants, as well as the impact of pre-structured social
interaction patterns that were modelled to mimic aspects of 'social exclusion'
scenarios. The results of the first study demonstrate that both the social
context of the interaction and the roles assigned to the system influence the
system evaluation, interaction patterns, textual expressions of affective
states, as well as emotional self-reports. The results observed for the second
study show the system's ability to partially exclude a participant from a
triadic conversation without triggering significantly different affective
reactions or a more negative system evaluation. The experimental evidence
provides insights on the perception, modelling and generation of affective and
social cues in artificial systems that can be realized in different modalities,
including the text modality, thus delivering valuable input for applying
affective dialogue systems as tools for studying affect and social aspects in
online communication."
"Both toolbar and dropdown menu are used popularly in a graphical user
interface with a similar objective of providing easy access to the internal
functions. Often the same functions are provided through both menu and toolbar.
  Both toolbar and dropdown menu have their own advantages and disadvantages. A
menu can provide more options occupying less real estate, while toolbar can
provide a single click access without navigating through trees and branches.
  As a menu and toolbar system shares many common objectives, it is often
useful maintain some relationship to coordinate between both the elements of a
GUI system. The relationships can be easy as both of them often share the same
internal function. For example, the print option in a menu will (most likely)
call the same function as the print button on the toolbar.
  This article discusses the similarities and differences between a dropdown
menu and toolbar. Five inventions trying to focus on both menu and toolbar are
illustrated in the article."
"Drag and drop operation is one of the key capabilities of any Graphical User
Interface. The user can do quite complex operations simply by visually dragging
and dropping objects from one location to another. It saves user from
remembering and typing a lot of commands.
  The result of a drag and drop operation may vary depending the type of source
object and type of destination object. For example dragging a file and dropping
on a folder may copy or move the file to the destination folder, dropping that
file to a remote FTP location may upload that file using internet, dropping
that file on a printer icon may print that file, dropping that file on the
trash can may delete that file, and dropping that file on an executable may
play or open or compute or manipulate that file.
  Although a drag and drop operation prima facie seems to be a simple
operation, it can become extremely complicated depending on the type of source
objects dragged and the type of destination objects selected for dropping.
There are many limitations of a conventional drag and drop operation. This
article points out the difficulties of a drag and drop operation and
illustrates the solutions disclosed by various inventions to overcome those
difficulties."
"Since computer was invented, people are using many devices to interact with
computer. Initially there were keyboard, mouse etc. but with the advancement of
technology, new ways are being discovered that are quite usual and natural to
the humans like stylus, touch-enable systems. In the current age of technology,
user is expected to touch the machine interface to give input. Hand gesture is
such a way to interact with machines where natural bare hand is used to
communicate without touching machine interface. It gives a feeling to user that
he is interacting in natural way to some human, not with traditional machines.
This paper presents a technique where user needs not to touch the machine
interface to draw on screen. Here hand finger draws shapes on monitor like
stylus, without touching the monitor. This method can be used in many
applications including games. The finger was used as an input device that acts
like paint-brush or finger-stylus and is used to make shapes in front of the
camera. Fingertip extraction and motion tracking were done in Matlab with real
time constraints. This work is an early attempt to replace stylus with the
natural finger without touching screen."
"The most important aspect of any Software is the operability for the intended
audience. This factor of operability is encompassed in the user interface,
which serves as the only window to the features of the system. It is thus
essential that the User Interface provided is robust, concise and lucid.
Presently there are no properly defined rules or guidelines for user interface
design enabling a perfect design, since such a system cannot be perceived. This
article aims at providing suggestions in the design of the User Interface,
which would make it easier for the user to navigate through the system features
and also the developers to guide the users towards better utilization of the
features."
"Software libraries for most of the modern programming languages are numerous,
large and complex. Remembering the syntax and usage of APIs is a difficult task
for not just novices but also expert programmers. IDEs (Integrated Development
Environment) provide capabilities like autocomplete and intellisense to assist
programmers; however, programmers still need to visit search engines like
Google to find API (Application Program Interface) documentation and samples.
This paper evaluates Redprint - a browser based development environment for PHP
that integrates API specific ""Instant Example"" and ""Instant Documentation""
display interfaces. A comparative laboratory study shows that integrating API
specific ""Instant Example"" and ""Instant Documentation"" display interfaces into
a development environment significantly reduces the cost of searching and thus
significantly reduces the time to develop software."
"Extending and modifying his domain of life by artifact production is one of
the main characteristics of humankind. From the first hominid, who used a wood
stick or a stone for extending his upper limbs and augmenting his gesture
strength, to current systems engineers who used technologies for augmenting
human cognition, perception and action, extending human body capabilities
remains a big issue. From more than fifty years cybernetics, computer and
cognitive sciences have imposed only one reductionist model of human machine
systems: cognitive systems. Inspired by philosophy, behaviorist psychology and
the information treatment metaphor, the cognitive system paradigm requires a
function view and a functional analysis in human systems design process.
According that design approach, human have been reduced to his metaphysical and
functional properties in a new dualism. Human body requirements have been left
to physical ergonomics or ""physiology"". With multidisciplinary convergence, the
issues of ""human-machine"" systems and ""human artifacts"" evolve. The loss of
biological and social boundaries between human organisms and interactive and
informational physical artifact questions the current engineering methods and
ergonomic design of cognitive systems. New developpment of human machine
systems for intensive care, human space activities or bio-engineering sytems
requires grounding human systems design on a renewed epistemological framework
for future human systems model and evidence based ""bio-engineering"". In that
context, reclaiming human factors, augmented human and human machine nature is
a necessity"
"Tracking data of user's activities resulting from Computer Mediated
Communication (CMC) tools (forum, chat, etc.) is often carried out in an ad-hoc
manner, which either confines the reusability of data in different purposes or
makes data exploitation difficult. Our research works are biased toward
methodological challenges involved in designing and developing a generic system
for tracking user's activities while interacting with asynchronous
communication tools like discussion forums. We present in this paper, an
approach for building a Web-based system for observing and analyzing user
activity on any type of discussion forums."
"Educative platforms are at the heart of the development of online education.
They can not only be reduced to technological aspects. Underlying models impact
teaching and learning from the preparing of lessons to the learning sessions.
Research related to these platforms are numerous and their stakes are
important. For these reasons, we launched a call to a special issue on ""Designs
and uses of educative platforms"" An educative platform is a computer system
designed to automate various functions relating to the organization of the
course, to the management of their content, to the monitoring of learners and
supervision of persons in charge of various formations (Office de la langue
fran\c{c}aise, 2005). So educative platforms are Learning Management Systems
(LMS) which are specific to education contexts."
"In a distance learning context, providing usual communication tools (forum,
chat, ...) is not always enough to create efficient interactions between
learners and to favour collective knowledge building. A solution consists in
setting-up collective activities which encourage learners to communicate. But,
even in that case, tools can sometimes become a barrier to communication. We
present in this paper examples of specific tools that are designed in order to
favour and to guide communications in an educational context, but also to
foster interactions during learning activities that are not inherently
collaborative. We describe synchronous communication tools (semi-structured
chat), asynchronous tools (temporally structured forum, contextual forum) and a
system which promotes mutual aid between learners."
"The aim of this paper is to determine the expectations that French-speaking
disabled persons have for electronic administrative sites (utility). At the
same time, it is a matter of identifying the difficulties of use that the
manipulation of these E-services poses concretely for blind people (usability)
and of evaluating the psychosocial impacts on the way of life of these people
with specific needs. We show that the lack of numerical accessibility is likely
to accentuate the social exclusion of which these people are victim by
establishing a numerical glass ceiling."
"This article proposes to describe and compare the contributions of various
techniques of evaluation of the accessibility of E-services carried out
starting from (i) methods of inspection (on the basis of traditional ergonomic
criteria and accessibility) and (ii) of tests of use. It show that these are
the latter which show the best rate of identification of the problems of uses
for the poeple with disabilities"
"While taking into account handicapped people in the design of technologies
represents a social and political stake that becomes important (in particular
with the recent law on equal rights for all the citizens, March 2004), this
paper aims at evaluating the level of accessibility of two sites of E-services
thanks to tests of use and proposing a set of recommendations in order to
increase usability for the largest amount of people."
"Portable Electronic Devices usually utilize a small screen with limited
viewing area and a keyboard with a limited number of keys. This makes it
difficult to perform quick searches in data arrays containing more than dozen
items such an address book or song list. In this article we present a new data
selection method which allows the user to quickly select an entry from a list
using 4-way navigation device such as joystick, trackball or 4-way key pad.
This method allows for quick navigation using just one hand, without looking at
the screen."
"This paper presents an interactive implementation which makes the link
between a human operator and a system of a administration of a relational
databases MySQL. This application conceived as a multimedia presentations is
illustrative for the way in which the transfer and the remaking of the
information between the human operator, the module of data processing and the
database which stores the informations can be solved (with help of the PHP
language and the web use)."
"This paper presents a general framework how controlled natural languages can
be evaluated and compared on the basis of user experiments. The subjects are
asked to classify given statements (in the language to be tested) as either
true or false with respect to a certain situation that is shown in a graphical
notation called ""ontographs"". A first experiment has been conducted that
applies this framework to the language Attempto Controlled English (ACE)."
"EEG-BCIs have been well studied in the past decades and implemented into
several famous applications, like P300 speller and wheelchair controller.
However, these interfaces are indirect due to low spatial resolution of EEG.
Recently, direct ECoG-BCIs attract intensive attention because ECoG provides a
higher spatial resolution and signal quality. This makes possible localization
of the source of neural signals with respect to certain brain functions. In
this article, we present a realization of ECoG-BCIs for finger flexion
prediction provided by BCI competition IV. Methods for finger flexion
prediction including feature extraction and selection are provided in this
article. Results show that the predicted finger movement is highly correlated
with the true movement when we use band-specific amplitude modulation."
"The advent of Web 3.0, claiming for personalization in interactive systems
(Lassila & Hendler, 2007), and the need for systems capable of interacting in a
more natural way in the future society flooded with computer systems and
devices (Harper et al., 2008) show that great advances in HCI should be done.
This chapter presents some contributions of LIA for the future of HCI,
defending that using common sense knowledge is a possibility for improving HCI,
especially because people assign meaning to their messages based on their
common sense and, therefore, the use of this knowledge in developing user
interfaces can make them more intuitive to the end-user. Moreover, as common
sense knowledge varies from group to group of people, it can be used for
developing applications capable of giving different feedback for different
target groups, as the applications presented along this chapter illustrate,
allowing, in this way, interface personalization taking into account cultural
issues. For the purpose of using common sense knowledge in the development and
design of computer systems, it is necessary to provide an architecture that
allows it. This chapter presents LIAs approaches for common sense knowledge
acquisition, representation and use, as well as for natural language
processing, contributing with those ones who intent to get into this
challenging world to get started."
"We investigated the role of HUDs in CAI. HUDs have been used in various
situations in daily lives by recent downsizing and cost down of the display
devices. CAI is one of the promising applications for HUDs. We have developed
an HUD-based CAI system for effectively presenting instructions of the
equipment in the transportable earth station. This chapter described HUDs in
CAI from a viewpoint of human-computer interaction based on the development
experience."
"M-learning (mobile learning) can take various forms. We are interested in
contextualized M-learning, i.e. the training related to the situation
physically or logically localized. Contextualization and pervasivity are
important aspects of our approach. We propose in particular MOCOCO principles
(Mobility - COntextualisation - COoperation) using IMERA platform (Mobile
Interaction in the Augmented Real Environment). We are studying various mobile
learning contexts related to professional activities, in order to master
appliances (Installation, Use, Breakdown diagnostic and Repairing).
Contextualization, traceability and checking of execution of prescribed
operations are based mainly on the use of RFID labels. Investigation of the
appropriate training methods for this kind of learning situation, applying
mainly a constructivist approach known as ""Just-in-time learning"", ""learning by
doing"", ""learning and doing"", constitutes an important topic of this project.
  From an organizational point of view we are in perfect symbiosis with EPSS -
Electronic Performance Support System [12] and our objective is to integrate
learning in professional activities in three ways: 1/ before work i.e. to learn
about coming actions, 2/ after work i.e. to learn about past actions to
understand what happened and accumulate experience, 3/ during work i.e. to
master the problem just-in-time"
"This paper proposes a controlled experiment to further investigate the
usefulness of gaze awareness and gesture recognition in the support of
collaborative work at a distance. We propose to redesign experiments conducted
several years ago with more recent technology that would: a) enable to better
study of the integration of communication modalities, b) allow users to freely
move while collaborating at a distance and c) avoid asymmetries of
communication between collaborators."
"Various techniques for developing spreadsheet models greatly improve the
chance that the end result will not contain basic mechanical errors. However,
for every discipline in which a given technique is useful, there is likely to
be another in which the same technique works badly. As a result, the author
urges that EuSpRIG does not succumb to internal or external pressures to
champion a particular set of ""best practices"", because no such set is optimal
in all spreadsheet applications."
"User-driven applications are the programs, in which the full control is given
to the users. Designers of such programs are responsible only for developing an
instrument for solving some task, but they do not enforce users to work with
this instrument according with the predefined scenario. Users' control of the
applications means that only users decide at any moment WHAT, WHEN, and HOW
must appear on the screen. Such applications can be constructed only on the
basis of moveable / resizable elements. Programs, based on such elements, have
very interesting features and open absolutely new possibilities. This article
describes the design of the user-driven applications and shows the consequences
of switching to such type of programs on the samples from different areas."
"Online labor markets have great potential as platforms for conducting
experiments, as they provide immediate access to a large and diverse subject
pool and allow researchers to conduct randomized controlled trials. We argue
that online experiments can be just as valid---both internally and
externally---as laboratory and field experiments, while requiring far less
money and time to design and to conduct. In this paper, we first describe the
benefits of conducting experiments in online labor markets; we then use one
such market to replicate three classic experiments and confirm their results.
We confirm that subjects (1) reverse decisions in response to how a
decision-problem is framed, (2) have pro-social preferences (value payoffs to
others positively), and (3) respond to priming by altering their choices. We
also conduct a labor supply field experiment in which we confirm that workers
have upward sloping labor supply curves. In addition to reporting these
results, we discuss the unique threats to validity in an online setting and
propose methods for coping with these threats. We also discuss the external
validity of results from online domains and explain why online results can have
external validity equal to or even better than that of traditional methods,
depending on the research question. We conclude with our views on the potential
role that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then
recommend software development priorities and best practices."
"This paper presents a creativity support tool, called FreePub, to collect and
organize scientific material using mindmaps. Mindmaps are visual, graph-based
represenations of concepts, ideas, notes, tasks, etc. They generally take a
hierarchical or tree branch format, with ideas branching into their
subsections. FreePub supports creativity cycles. A user starts such a cycle by
setting up her domain of interest using mindmaps. Then, she can browse mindmaps
and launch search tasks to gather relevant publications from several data
sources. FreePub, besides publications, identifies helpful supporting material
(e.g., blog posts, presentations). All retrieved information from FreePub can
be imported and organized in mindmaps. FreePub has been fully implemented on
top of FreeMind, a popular open-source, mindmapping tool."
"Direct-touch presentation devices such as touch-sensitive electronic
whiteboards have two serious problems. First, the presenter's hand movements
tend to distract the audience's attention from content. Second, the presenter'
s manipulation tends to obscure content. In this paper we describe a new
electronic whiteboard system that supports multi-touch gestures and employs a
special pie menu interface named ""sPieMenu."" This pie menu is displayed under
the presenter's palm and is thus invisible to the audience. A series of
experiments shows that the proposed system allows both novice and expert users
to efficiently manipulate the electronic whiteboard, and that the proposed
system decreases distraction to the audience compared to traditional
approaches."
"Recent empirical research has indicated that human graph reading performance
improves when crossing angles increase. However, crossing angle has not been
used as an aesthetic criterion for graph drawing algorithms so far. In this
paper, we introduce a force-directed method that aims to construct graph
drawings with large crossing angles. Experiments indicate that our method
significantly increases crossing angles. Surprisingly, the experimental results
further demonstrate that the resulting drawings produced by our method have
fewer edge crossings, a shorter total edge length and more uniform edge
lengths, compared to classical spring algorithms."
"Product Data Management (PDM) desktop and web based systems maintain the
organizational technical and managerial data to increase the quality of
products by improving the processes of development, business process flows,
change management, product structure management, project tracking and resource
planning. Though PDM is heavily benefiting industry but PDM community is facing
a very serious unresolved issue in PDM system development with flexible and
user friendly graphical user interface for efficient human machine
communication. PDM systems offer different services and functionalities at a
time but the graphical user interfaces of most of the PDM systems are not
designed in a way that a user (especially a new user) can easily learn and use
them. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in field of Human
Computer Interaction; resultant data provides the information about graphical
user interface development using rich internet applications. The accomplished
goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a proposition of a
conceptual model for the implementation of a flexible web based graphical user
interface. The proposed conceptual model was successfully designed into
implementation model and a resultant prototype putting values to the field is
now available. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept,
implementation designs and developed prototype is also discussed in this paper.
Moreover in the end, prototype is compared with respective functions of
existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness
against targeted challenge"
"The location determination in obstructed area can be very challenging
especially if Global Positioning System are blocked. Users will find it
difficult to navigate directly on-site in such condition, especially indoor car
park lot or obstructed environment. Sometimes, it needs to combine with other
sensors and positioning methods in order to determine the location with more
intelligent, reliable and ubiquity. By using ubiquitous positioning in mobile
navigation system, it is a promising ubiquitous location technique in a mobile
phone since as it is a familiar personal electronic device for many people.
However, as research on ubiquitous positioning systems goes beyond basic
methods there is an increasing need for better comparison of proposed
ubiquitous positioning systems. System developers are also lacking of good
frameworks for understanding different options during building ubiquitous
positioning systems. This paper proposes taxonomy to address both of these
problems. The proposed taxonomy has been constructed from a literature study of
papers and articles on positioning estimation that can be used to determine
location everywhere on mobile navigation system. For researchers the taxonomy
can also be used as an aid for scoping out future research in the area of
ubiquitous positioning."
"Computer-aided surgery intensively uses the concept of navigation: after
having collected CT data from a patient and transferred them to the operating
room coordinate system, the surgical instrument (a puncture needle for
instance) is localized and its position is visualized with respect to the
patient organs which are not directly visible. This approach is very similar to
the GPS paradigm. Traditionally, three orthogonal slices in the patient data
are presented on a distant screen. Sometimes a 3D representation is also added.
In this study we evaluated the potential of adding a smart phone as a
man-machine interaction device. Different experiments involving operators
puncturing a phantom are reported in this paper."
"We present the application of Principal Component Analysis for data acquired
during the design of a natural gesture interface. We investigate the concept of
an eigengesture for motion capture hand gesture data and present the
visualisation of principal components obtained in the course of conducted
experiments. We also show the influence of dimensionality reduction on
reconstructed gesture data quality."
"In this paper we investigate a technique to find out vocal source based
features from the LP residual of speech signal for automatic speaker
identification. Autocorrelation with some specific lag is computed for the
residual signal to derive these features. Compared to traditional features like
MFCC, PLPCC which represent vocal tract information, these features represent
complementary vocal cord information. Our experiment in fusing these two
sources of information in representing speaker characteristics yield better
speaker identification accuracy. We have used Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
based speaker modeling and results are shown on two public databases to
validate our proposition."
"Specifying and programming graphical interactions are difficult tasks,
notably because designers have difficulties to express the dynamics of the
interaction. This paper shows how the MDPC architecture improves the usability
of the specification and the implementation of graphical interaction. The
architecture is based on the use of picking views and inverse transforms from
the graphics to the data. With three examples of graphical interaction, we show
how to express them with the architecture, how to implement them, and how this
improves programming usability. Moreover, we show that it enables implementing
graphical interaction without a scene graph. This kind of code prevents from
errors due to cache consistency management."
"Historically the training of teams has been implemented using a face-to-face
approach. In the past decade, on-line multiuser virtual environments have
offered a solution for training teams whose members are geographically
dispersed. In order to develop on effective team training activity, a high
sense of presence among the participant needs to be reached. Previous research
studies reported being able to reach a high level of presence even when using
inexpensive technology such as laptop and headset. This study evaluates the
level of presence of ten subjects who have to perform a team-building activity
in a multi-user virtual environment using a laptop computer and a headset. The
authors are interested in determining which user characterizes, such as gender,
age and knowledge of computers, have a strong correlation with the level of
sense of presence. The results of this study showed that female participants
were more likely to engage in the activity and perceived fewer negative
effects. Participants who reported less negative effects such as feeling tired,
dizzy, or experiencing eye strain during the team-building activity reached a
higher level of sense of presence."
"Computers have a direct impact on our lives nowadays. Human's interaction
with the computer has modified with the passage of time as improvement in
technology occurred the better the human computer interaction became. Today we
are facilitated by the operating system that has reduced all the complexity of
hardware and we undergo our computation in a very convenient way irrespective
of the process occurring at the hardware level. Though the human computer
interaction has improved but it's not done yet. If we come to the future the
computer's role in our lives would be a lot more rather our life would be of
the artificial intelligence. In our future the biggest resource would be
component of time and wasting time for a key board entry or a mouse input would
be unbearable so the need would be of the computer interaction environment that
along with the complexity reduction also minimizes the time wastage in the
human computer interaction. Accordingly in our future the computation would
also be increased it would not be a simple operating system limited to a
computer it would be computers managing our entire life activities hence fall
out of domain of present computers electronic based architecture .In this
research paper we propose a model that shall be meeting the future human
computer interaction needs possessing linguistic human computer interference
environment based on surface technology, automation and photonic computing,
which would be reliable, efficient and quicker satisfying all the future
artificial intelligence pre requisites."

"A combination of a telepresence system and a microscopic traffic simulator is
introduced. It is evaluated using a hotel evacuation scenario. Four different
kinds of supporting information are compared, standard exit signs, floor plans
with indicated exit routes, guiding lines on the floor and simulated agents
leading the way. The results indicate that guiding lines are the most efficient
way to support an evacuation but the natural behavior of following others comes
very close. On another level the results are consistent with previously
performed real and virtual experiments and validate the use of a telepresence
system in evacuation studies. It is shown that using a microscopic traffic
simulator extends the possibilities for evaluation, e.g. by adding simulated
humans to the environment."
"In this paper we introduce the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
inhibitor, which is meant to standby the BCI until the user is ready, in order
to improve the overall performance and usability of the system. BCI inhibitor
can be defined as a system that monitors user's state and inhibits BCI
interaction until specific requirements (e.g. brain activity pattern, user
attention level) are met. In this pilot study, a hybrid BCI is designed and
composed of a classic synchronous BCI system based on motor imagery and a BCI
inhibitor. The BCI inhibitor initiates the control period of the BCI when
requirements in terms of brain activity are reached (i.e. stability in the beta
band). Preliminary results with four participants suggest that BCI inhibitor
system can improve BCI performance."
"In this paper we describe a proposal for information organization for
computer supported cooperative work, while working with spatial information. It
is focused on emergency response plan construction, and the requirements
extracted from that task. At the centre of our proposal is the analysis of the
structure of the cooperative workspace. We argue that the internal information
representation should follow a spatial approach, tying the structure used to
manage users with the structure used to manage information, suggesting the use
of different spaces to represent the information. The gain we expect from this
approach is the improved capacity to extract information on how people are
cooperating and their relationship with the information they are working with.
The ideas are introduced while focusing on real life emergency planning
activities, where we discuss the current shortcomings of the cooperation
strategies in use and propose a solution."
"Display advertising has been a significant source of revenue for publishers
and ad networks in online advertising ecosystem. One of the main goals in
display advertising is to maximize user response rate for advertising
campaigns, such as click through rates (CTR) or conversion rates. Although in
the online advertising industry we believe that the visual appearance of ads
(creatives) matters for propensity of user response, there is no published work
so far to address this topic via a systematic data-driven approach. In this
paper we quantitatively study the relationship between the visual appearance
and performance of creatives using large scale data in the world's largest
display ads exchange system, RightMedia. We designed a set of 43 visual
features, some of which are novel and some are inspired by related work. We
extracted these features from real creatives served on RightMedia. We also
designed and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
visual features for CTR prediction, ranking and performance classification.
Based on the evaluation results, we selected a subset of features that have the
most important impact on CTR. We believe that the findings presented in this
paper will be very useful for the online advertising industry in designing
high-performance creatives. It also provides the research community with the
first ever data set, initial insights into visual appearance's effect on user
response propensity, and evaluation benchmarks for further study."
"Spatial information can be difficult to present to a visually impaired
computer user. In this paper we examine a new kind of tactile cueing for
non-visual interaction as a potential solution, building on earlier work on
vibrotactile Tactons. However, unlike vibrotactile Tactons, we use a pin array
to stimulate the finger tip. Here, we describe how to design static and dynamic
Tactons by defining their basic components. We then present user tests
examining how easy it is to distinguish between different forms of pin array
Tactons demonstrating accurate Tacton sets to represent directions. These
experiments demonstrate usable patterns for static, wave and blinking pin array
Tacton sets for guiding a user in one of eight directions. A study is then
described that shows the benefits of structuring Tactons to convey information
through multiple parameters of the signal. By using multiple independent
parameters for a Tacton, this study demonstrates participants perceive more
information through a single Tacton. Two applications using these Tactons are
then presented: a maze exploration application and an electric circuit
exploration application designed for use by and tested with visually impaired
users."
"We present U-Note, an augmented teaching and learning system leveraging the
advantages of paper while letting teachers and pupils benefit from the richness
that digital media can bring to a lecture. U-Note provides automatic linking
between the notes of the pupils' notebooks and various events that occurred
during the class (such as opening digital documents, changing slides, writing
text on an interactive whiteboard...). Pupils can thus explore their notes in
conjunction with the digital documents that were presented by the teacher
during the lesson. Additionally, they can also listen to what the teacher was
saying when a given note was written. Finally, they can add their own comments
and documents to their notebooks to extend their lecture notes. We interviewed
teachers and deployed questionnaires to identify both teachers and pupils'
habits: most of the teachers use (or would like to use) digital documents in
their lectures but have problems in sharing these resources with their pupils.
The results of this study also show that paper remains the primary medium used
for knowledge keeping, sharing and editing by the pupils. Based on these
observations, we designed U-Note, which is built on three modules. U-Teach
captures the context of the class: audio recordings, the whiteboard contents,
together with the web pages, videos and slideshows displayed during the lesson.
U-Study binds pupils' paper notes (taken with an Anoto digital pen) with the
data coming from U-Teach and lets pupils access the class materials at home,
through their notebooks. U-Move lets pupils browse lecture materials on their
smartphone when they are not in front of a computer."
"We propose a new technique to help users to explore geometric shapes without
vision. This technique is based on a guidance using directional cues with a pin
array. This is an alternative to the usual technique that consists of raising
the pins corresponding to dark pixels around the cursor. In this paper we
compare the exploration of geometric shapes with our new technique in unimanual
and bimanual conditions. The users made fewer errors in unimanual condition
than in bimanual condition. However they did not explore the shapes more
quickly and there was no difference in confidence in their answer."
"Collaboration technology typically focuses on collaboration and group
processes (cooperation, communication, coordination and coproduction).
Knowledge Management (KM) technology typically focuses on content (creation,
storage, sharing and use of data, information and knowledge). Yet, to achieve
their common goals, teams and organizations need both KM and collaboration
technology to make that more effective and efficient. This paper is interested
in knowledge management and collaboration regarding their convergence and their
integration. First, it contributes to a better understanding of the knowledge
management and collaboration concepts. Second, it focuses on KM and
collaboration convergence by presenting the different interpretation of this
convergence. Third, this paper proposes a generic framework of collaborative
knowledge management."
"In this paper we report on a system, ""SpeechJammer"", which can be used to
disturb people's speech. In general, human speech is jammed by giving back to
the speakers their own utterances at a delay of a few hundred milliseconds.
This effect can disturb people without any physical discomfort, and disappears
immediately by stop speaking. Furthermore, this effect does not involve anyone
but the speaker. We utilize this phenomenon and implemented two prototype
versions by combining a direction-sensitive microphone and a
direction-sensitive speaker, enabling the speech of a specific person to be
disturbed. We discuss practical application scenarios of the system, such as
facilitating and controlling discussions. Finally, we argue what system
parameters should be examined in detail in future formal studies based on the
lessons learned from our preliminary study."
"With the increasing emphasis on how mobile technologies are experienced in
everyday life, researchers are increasingly emphasizing the use of in-situ
methods such as Experience Sampling and Day Reconstruction. In our line of
research we explore the concept of Technology-Assisted Reconstruction, in which
passively logged behavior data assist in the later reconstruction of daily
experiences. In this paper we introduce Footprint tracker, a web application
that supports participants in reviewing lifelogs and reconstructing their daily
experiences. We focus on three kinds of data: visual (as captured through
Microsoft's sensecam), location, and context (i.e., SMS and calls received and
made). We describe how Footprint Tracker supports the user in reviewing these
lifelogs and outline a field study that attempts to inquire into whether and
how this data support reconstruction from memory."
"We introduce Sense{\mu} (pronounced ""sense me""), a mobile application that
aims at supporting awareness in parent- child relationships through the sensing
capabilities of mobile devices. We discuss the relevance of three types of
awareness information: physical activity inferred from accelerometers, verbal
activity during class hours inferred from microphones, and social activity
inferred from Bluetooth pair-wise proximity sensing. We describe how we attempt
to contextualize these sensing data with the goal of supporting parents'
awareness of the educational performance and social wellbeing of their
children, as well as motivating and sustaining a two-way communication between
parents and teachers over the long term."
"Experience Sampling has been considered the golden standard of in-situ
measurement, yet, at the expense of high burden to participants. In this paper
we propose Technology-Assisted Reconstruction (TAR), a methodological approach
that combines passive logging of users' behaviors with use of these data in
assisting the reconstruction of behaviors and experiences. Through a number of
recent and ongoing projects we will discuss how TAR may be employed for the
evaluation of personal informatics systems, but also, conversely, how ideas
from the field of personal informatics may contribute towards the development
of new methodologies for in-situ evaluation."
"Multimodal interactive maps are a solution for presenting spatial information
to visually impaired people. In this paper, we present an interactive
multimodal map prototype that is based on a tactile paper map, a multi-touch
screen and audio output. We first describe the different steps for designing an
interactive map: drawing and printing the tactile paper map, choice of
multi-touch technology, interaction technologies and the software architecture.
Then we describe the method used to assess user satisfaction. We provide data
showing that an interactive map - although based on a unique, elementary,
double tap interaction - has been met with a high level of user satisfaction.
Interestingly, satisfaction is independent of a user's age, previous visual
experience or Braille experience. This prototype will be used as a platform to
design advanced interactions for spatial learning."
"Context information brings new opportunities for efficient and effective
applications and services on mobile devices. A wide range of research has
exploited context dependency, i.e., the relations between context(s) and the
outcome, to achieve significant, quantified, performance gains for a variety of
applications. These works often have to deal with the challenges of multiple
sources of context that can lead to a sparse training data set, and the
challenge of energy hungry context sensors. Often, they address these
challenges in an application specific and ad-hoc manner. We liberate mobile
application designers and researchers from these burdens by providing a
methodical approach to these challenges. In particular, we 1) define and
measure the context-dependency of three fundamental types of mobile usage in an
application agnostic yet practical manner, which can provide clear insight into
the performance of potential ap-plication. 2) Address the challenge of data
sparseness when dealing with multiple and different sources of context in a
systematic manner. 3) Present SmartContext to address the energy challenge by
automatically selecting among context sources while ensuring the minimum
accuracy for each estimation event is met.
  Our analysis and findings are based on usage and context traces collected in
real-life settings from 24 iPhone users over a period of one year. We present
findings regarding the context dependency of the three principal types of
mobile usage; visited websites, phone calls, and app usage. Yet, our
methodology and the lessons we learn can be readily extended to other
context-dependent mobile usage and system resources as well. Our findings guide
the development of context aware systems, and highlight the challenges and
expectations regarding the context dependency of mobile usage."
"In this paper we present an approach that integrates interactive
visualizations in the exploratory search process. In this model visualizations
can act as hubs where large amounts of information are made accessible in easy
user interfaces. Through interaction techniques this information can be
combined with related information on the World Wide Web. We applied the new
search concept to the domain of stock market information and conducted a user
study. Participants could use this interface without instructions, could
complete complex tasks like identifying related information items, link
heterogeneous information types and use different interaction techniques to
access related information more easily. In this way, users could quickly
acquire knowledge in an unfamiliar domain."
"This paper introduces the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and eye
tracking in exploring customer experiences in service design. These tools are
expected to allow designers to generate customer journeys from empirical data
leading to new visualization methods and therefore improvements in service
design deliverables."
"Nowadays whenever a user buys any gadget, apart from the price his focus
would also be on how easy is the functionality of the gadget. This means users
are more concerned towards the usability of the gadget. Therefore, this study
set to explore usability evaluations methods for children in order to analyze
their roles in the development of technology. Usability evaluation methods
which are successfully tested on the adults are investigated to find out how
successfully they can also be applied to children. The results of the review
indicate that usability evaluation with children is more challenging than with
adults. The study found that depending on one type of usability evaluation
method would not be an appropriate decision."
"Web usability is continuing to be a pressing problem. For number of years
researchers have been developed tools for doing automatic web usability
testing. This study uses our own PHP, and MySQL based tool AWebHUT: Automated
Web Homepage Usability Tester to evaluate web usability of full Dmoz
(www.dmoz.org) Asia web sites (45126 on time stamp 2011-12-03 04:12:46 GMT).
The tool uses an extensive automated quantitative analysis of XHTML source code
of homepages against seventeen organised web usability guidelines. The
automated quantitative approach is effective on large scale to achieve better
usability. The AWebHUT uses four web usability levels such as N: Neutral, V:
Violate, R: Respect, and E: Error to evaluate web usability. The main objective
of the study is to produce data which is used to answer research questions, (1)
Are there any categories of web sites which have usability problems? Which
ones? and (2) Are there any categories in which the usability is typically
higher? Why? The findings were indicated that all Asia categories have
usability problems. Furthermore, there are four web sites which have highest
web usability problem with violation percentage 71. One step further, the Asia
category: Weather has highest usability problems with 42.2819 as the average of
the violation percentage. The category Weather uses tables and images,
considerable amount of those were not satisfying web usability guidelines which
relates to tables and images. One step further, the Asia wants to get the same
level of usability as North America, Europe, and Australia therefore it is
essential to have an automated web usability evaluation in Asia web sites to
identify web usability problems which are important for improving Asia web
sites."
"We describe and motivate three goals for the screen display of asynchronous
text deliberation pertaining to a document: (1) visibility of relationships
between comments and the text they reference, between different comments, and
between group members and the document and discussion, and (2)
distinguishability of boundaries between contextually related and unrelated
text and comments and between individual authors of documents and comments.
Interfaces for document-centered discussion generally fail to fulfill one or
both of these goals as well as they could. We describe the design of the new
version of Deme, a Web-based platform for online deliberation, and argue that
it achieves the two goals better than other recent designs."
"This paper explores using RSS measurements on many links in a wireless
network to estimate the breathing rate of a person, and the location where the
breathing is occurring, in a home, while the person is sitting, laying down,
standing, or sleeping. The main challenge in breathing rate estimation is that
""motion interference"", i.e., movements other than a person's breathing,
generally cause larger changes in RSS than inhalation and exhalation. We
develop a method to estimate breathing rate despite motion interference, and
demonstrate its performance during multiple short (3-7 minute) tests and during
a longer 66 minute test. Further, for the same experiments, we show the
location of the breathing person can be estimated, to within about 2 m average
error in a 56 square meter apartment. Being able to locate a breathing person
who is not otherwise moving, without calibration, is important for applications
in search and rescue, health care, and security."
"In recent years videogame companies have recognized the role of player
engagement as a major factor in user experience and enjoyment. This encouraged
a greater investment in new types of game controllers such as the WiiMote, Rock
Band instruments and the Kinect. However, the native software of these
controllers was not originally designed to be used in other game applications.
This work addresses this issue by building a middleware framework, which maps
body poses or voice commands to actions in any game. This not only warrants a
more natural and customized user-experience but it also defines an
interoperable virtual controller. In this version of the framework, body poses
and voice commands are respectively recognized through the Kinect's built-in
cameras and microphones. The acquired data is then translated into the native
interaction scheme in real time using a lightweight method based on spatial
restrictions. The system is also prepared to use Nintendo's Wiimote as an
auxiliary and unobtrusive gamepad for physically or verbally impractical
commands. System validation was performed by analyzing the performance of
certain tasks and examining user reports. Both confirmed this approach as a
practical and alluring alternative to the game's native interaction scheme. In
sum, this framework provides a game-controlling tool that is totally
customizable and very flexible, thus expanding the market of game consumers."
"This research explores the accessibility issues with regard to the e-commerce
websites in developing countries, through a study of Sri Lankan hotel websites.
A web survey and a web content analysis were conducted as the methods to elicit
data on web accessibility. Factors preventing accessibility were hypothesized
as an initial experiment. Affecting design elements are identified through web
content analysis, the results of which are utilized to develop specific
implications for improving web accessibility. The hypothesis tests show that
there is no significant correlation between accessibility and geographical or
economic factors. However, physical impairments of users have a considerable
influence on the accessibility of web page user interface if it has been
designed without full consideration of the needs of all users. Especially,
visual and mobility impaired users experience poor accessibility. Poor
readability and less navigable page designs are two observable issues, which
pose threats to accessibility. The lack of conformance to W3C accessibility
guidelines and the poor design process are the specific shortcomings which
reduce the overall accessibility. Guidelines aim to improve the accessibility
of sites with a strategic focus. Further enhancements are suggested with
adherence to principles, user centered design and developing customizable web
portals compatible for connections with differing speeds. Re-ordering search
results has been suggested as one of the finest step towards making the web
content accessible for users with differing needs. A need for developing new
design models for differencing user groups and implementing web accessibility
strategy are emphasized as vital steps towards effective information
dissemination via e-commerce websites in the developing countries."
"This paper aims to present the current position of the ongoing research into
developing the requirements and acceptance of a virtual therapeutic community
in Second Life, specifically for people with Borderline Personality Disorder
(BPD). The research has identified this particular user group given that people
with BPD often require high levels of support, which can result in emergency
hospital admissions, in addition to the significant economic cost of treating
people BPD in relation to other mental illnesses (NCCMH, 2009). The research is
also intended to be used as framework for other mental health conditions. This
work is a continuation of the research carried out in exploring the potential
of virtual therapeutic communities based on existing models of therapeutic
hospitals as well as virtual treatments and support, in treating people with
BPD. An interdisciplinary approach to this research features collaboration from
areas in HCI, forensic psychology and psychotherapy."
"Combining low cost wireless EEG sensors with smartphones offers novel
opportunities for mobile brain imaging in an everyday context. We present a
framework for building multi-platform, portable EEG applications with real-time
3D source reconstruction. The system - Smartphone Brain Scanner - combines an
off-the-shelf neuroheadset or EEG cap with a smartphone or tablet, and as such
represents the first fully mobile system for real-time 3D EEG imaging. We
discuss the benefits and challenges of a fully portable system, including
technical limitations as well as real-time reconstruction of 3D images of brain
activity. We present examples of the brain activity captured in a simple
experiment involving imagined finger tapping, showing that the acquired signal
in a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained with standard EEG lab
equipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using a
off-the-shelf consumer neuroheadset is lower compared to that obtained using
high density standard EEG equipment, we propose that mobile application
development may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new
opportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings."
"Nowadays, the Web has become one of the most widespread platforms for
information change and retrieval. As it becomes easier to publish documents, as
the number of users, and thus publishers, increases and as the number of
documents grows, searching for information is turning into a cumbersome and
time-consuming operation. Because of the loose interconnection between
documents, people have difficulty remembering where they have been and
returning to previously visited pages. Navigation through the web faces
problems of locating oneself with respect to space and time. The idea of
graphical assistance navigation is to help users to find their paths in
hyperspace by adapting the style of link presentation to the goals, knowledge
and other characteristics of an individual user. We first introduce the
concepts related to web navigation; we then present an overview of different
graphical navigation tools and techniques. We conclude by presenting a
comparative table of these tools based on some pertinent criteria."
"Isabelle/PIDE is the current Prover IDE technology for Isabelle. It has been
developed in ML and Scala in the past 4-5 years for this particular proof
assistant, but with an open mind towards other systems. PIDE is based on an
asynchronous document model, where the prover receives edits continuously and
updates its internal state accordingly. The interpretation of edits and the
policies for proof document processing are determined by the prover. The editor
front-end merely takes care of visual rendering of formal document content.
  Here we report on an experiment to connect Coq to the PIDE infrastructure of
Isabelle. This requires to re-implement the core PIDE protocol layer of
Isabelle/ML in OCaml. The payload for semantic processing of proof document
content is restricted to lexical analysis in the sense of existing CoqIde
functionality. This is sufficient as proof-of-concept for PIDE connectivity.
Actual proof processing is then a matter of improving Coq towards timeless and
stateless proof processing, independently of PIDE technicalities. The
implementation worked out smoothly and required minimal changes to the refined
PIDE architecture of Isabelle2013.
  This experiment substantiates PIDE as general approach to prover interaction.
It illustrates how other provers of the greater ITP family can participate by
following similar reforms of the classic TTY loop as was done for Isabelle in
the past few years."
"It is a fact of our existence, that no matter where we are, we most often
find ourselves either hearing, seeing, talking, or even engaged in design
related activities. Despite this reality, the notion of 'design', and in
particular 'engineering design', is often ambiguous, and at times obscure.
Thus, the transfer of knowledge of this crucial topic to engineering students
engaged in practical hands-on learning or analytical research is usually
perplexing to accomplish. In light of this, it becomes worthwhile to dissect
and reflect on the abstraction of the design process in engineering. In fact,
the aim of this article is to investigate the facets of applied design, and
elaborate on its diversity, complexity and elements. Eventually, by
concretizing this subject matter, we hope to slightly assist engineering
students in alleviating some of the vagueness associated with the principle of
design, and enhance their technical skillset during innovative conceptions."
"Whenever a visualization researcher is asked about the purpose of
visualization, the phrase ""gaining insight"" by and large pops out
instinctively. However, it is not absolutely factual that all uses of
visualization are for gaining a deep understanding, unless the term insight is
broadened to encompass all types of thought. Even when insight is the focus of
a visualization task, it is rather difficult to know what insight is gained,
how much, or how accurate. In this paper, we propose that ""saving time"" in
accomplishing a user's task is the most fundamental objective. By giving
emphasis to saving time, we can establish a concrete metric, alleviate
unnecessary contention caused by different interpretations of insight, and
stimulate new research efforts in some aspects of visualization, such as
empirical studies, design optimisation and theories of visualization."
"The video game industry has grown to a multi-billion dollar, worldwide
industry. The background music tends adaptively in reference to the specific
game content during the game length of the play. Adaptive music should be
further explored by looking at the particular condition in the game; such
condition is driven by generating a specific music in the background which best
fits in with the active game content throughout the length of the gameplay.
This research paper outlines the use of condition driven adaptive music
generation for audio and video to dynamically incorporate adaptively."
"Communities present considerable challenges for the design and application of
supportive information technology (IT), especially when these develop in
loosely-integrated, informal and scarcely organized contexts, like it is often
the case of Communities of Practice (CoP). An approach that actively supports
user communities in the process of IT appropriation can help alleviate the
impossibility of the members of these communities to rely on professional
support, and enable even complex forms of tailoring and End-User Development
(EUD). Although this approach has been already explored by an increasing number
of researchers, however there is still a lack of a general framework that could
play a role in the comparison of existing proposals and in the development of
new EUD solutions for CoPs. The paper proposes a conceptual framework and a
related architecture, called Logic of Bricolage, that aims to be a step further
in this direction to enable better EUD-oriented support for digitized
communities. The framework is described and the architecture instantiated in
three concrete EUD environments that specifically regard collaborative
activities in order to show the generality and applicability of the framework."
"Aesthetics are often used to evaluate the quality of graph drawings. However,
the existing aesthetic criteria are useful in judging the extents to which a
drawing conforms to particular drawing rules. They have limitations in
evaluating overall quality. Currently the overall quality of graph drawings is
mainly evaluated based on personal judgments and user studies. Personal
judgments are not reliable, while user studies can be costly to run. Therefore,
there is a need for a direct measure of overall quality. This measure can be
used by visualization designers to quickly compare the quality of drawings at
hand at the design stage and make decisions accordingly. In an attempt to meet
this need, we propose a measure that measures overall quality based on
aggregation of individual aesthetic criteria. We present a user study that
validates this measure and demonstrates its capacity in predicting the
performance of human graph comprehension. The implications of the proposed
measure for future research are discussed."
"Performing controlled user experiments on small devices in naturalistic
mobile settings has always proved to be a difficult undertaking for many Human
Factors researchers. Difficulties exist, not least, because mimicking natural
small device usage suffers from a lack of unobtrusive data to guide
experimental design, and then validate that the experiment is proceeding
naturally.Here we use observational data to derive a set of protocols and a
simple checklist of validations which can be built into the design of any
controlled experiment focused on the user interface of a small device. These,
have been used within a series of experimental designs to measure the utility
and application of experimental software. The key-point is the validation
checks -- based on the observed behaviour of 400 mobile users -- to ratify that
a controlled experiment is being perceived as natural by the user. While the
design of the experimental route which the user follows is a major factor in
the experimental setup, without check validations based on unobtrusive observed
data there can be no certainty that an experiment designed to be natural is
actually progressing as the design implies."
"In this paper, we investigate the effect of context on usability evaluation.
The focus is on how children behave and perform when they are tested in
different settings. Two most commonly applied usability evaluation methods: the
think-aloud and constructive interactions are applied to the children in
different physical contexts. We present an experimental design involving 54
children participating in two different configurations of constructive
interaction and a traditional think-aloud. The behavior and performance of the
children in two different physical contexts is measured by evaluating the
results of application of think-aloud and constructive interaction. Finally, we
outline lessons on the impact of context on involving children in usability
testing."
"The system has come to light through the way of inspiration to develop a
compact system, based on the fundamental ideas of safety, security and control.
Once this system is installed to operation specifying temperature and smoke
threshold, in case of any emergency situation due to increasing temperature
and/or smoke at place surpassing the threshold, the system immediately sends
automatic alert-notifications to the users, concerned with the situations. The
user gets total control over the system through mobile SMS, even from the
distant location, that to change the threshold, turn on/off the feature of
sending 'alert notification' and also to reset the system after the emergency
situation is overcome. Before executing any command (through SMS) from the
user, the system asks for the preset password to verify an authorized user. The
security issues have been considered with utter attention in this system to
ensure its applicability in industries and business organizations, where
security is an important concern. Hence, the fundamental ideas of safety,
security and control have been entirely ensured through the system, which have
definitely worked as the gear moving factor to look for a new dimension of an
'Intelligent Fire Alert System'."
"High-dimensional data visualization has been attracting much attention. To
fully test related software and algorithms, researchers require a diverse pool
of data with known and desired features. Test data do not always provide this,
or only partially. Here we propose the paradigm WYDIWYGS (What You Draw Is What
You Get). Its embodiment, Sketch Pad ND, is a tool that allows users to
generate high-dimensional data in the same interface they also use for
visualization. This provides for an immersive and direct data generation
activity, and furthermore it also enables users to interactively edit and clean
existing high-dimensional data from possible artifacts. Sketch Pad ND offers
two visualization paradigms, one based on parallel coordinates and the other
based on a relatively new framework using an N-D polygon to navigate in
high-dimensional space. The first interface allows users to draw arbitrary
profiles of probability density functions along each dimension axis and sketch
shapes for data density and connections between adjacent dimensions. The second
interface embraces the idea of sculpting. Users can carve data at arbitrary
orientations and refine them wherever necessary. This guarantees the data
generated is truly high-dimensional. We demonstrate our tool's usefulness in
real data visualization scenarios."
"From the earliest days of computing, there have been tools to help shape
narrative. Spell-checking, word counts, and readability analysis, give today's
novelists tools that Dickens, Austen, and Shakespeare could only have dreamt
of. However, such tools have focused on the word, or phrase levels. In the last
decade, research focus has shifted to support for collaborative editing of
documents. This work considers more sophisticated attempts to visualise the
semantics, pace and rhythm within a narrative through data mining. We describe
real life applications in two related domains."
"A salient feature of the manned spacecraft is the predominance of discrete
information in the manual control loop of the onboard systems. Specifically,
command-signaling control panels (CSCP) as a subsystem of the manual control
loop are widely used in the Russian manned spacecraft. In this paper CSCP are
classified into four types: a) control panels based on multi-channel control;
b) control panels based on command-information compression; c) control panels
based on command and signaling information compression; d) integrated control
consoles (ICC) based on computer and information technology. It is shown that
ICC underlies modern information display systems (IDS). ICC first appeared in
the Russian manned space program in the IDS of the Soyuz-TMA spacecraft and the
Russian modules of the International Space Station. Results of engineering and
psychological studies of different types of panels are produced."
"Computer has been incorporated into day to day activities of almost every
field of human endeavour, offices to different shops. Therefore many people are
now working with computer for longer hours of time. There is no doubt that this
incorporation of computer has helped users a lot but it also brings problems to
the users. One of the problems is Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Five hundred
and thirty one (531) questionnaires were personally administered to different
categories of people that use computer in various works of life, ranging from
banking sector, civil service, educational sector, health sector to private
sector. The distribution cut across different professions. A statistical
analysis was conducted on the data obtained using frequency distribution,
Pearson Correlation and Linear Regression. The result obtained showed that
94.3% of the respondents suffered pain from one or more parts of the body.
86.8% of the respondents suffered from eyestrain, 63.9% suffered from low back
pain, 67.4% with wrist pain, 64.7% finger pain while the least suffered pain
was foot pain which only 19% responded positively to it. There are significant
relationships between duration of computer usage, type of chair used, type and
size of monitor used and the incidence of RSI. RSI modeled was formulated
through linear regression which showed that a unit change in computer will
result in corresponding 1.76 unit increases in RSI and a unit change in
ergonomic deficiency will also result in corresponding 0.66 increases in RSI.
The existence of RSI was established and it was discovered that the more time
spent on the computer system, the more the proximity of having strain or pain
in one or more part(s) of the body."
"We explore various techniques to incorporate grid-like layout conventions
into a force-directed, constraint-based graph layout framework. In doing so we
are able to provide high-quality layout---with predominantly axis-aligned
edges---that is more flexible than previous grid-like layout methods and which
can capture layout conventions in notations such as SBGN (Systems Biology
Graphical Notation). Furthermore, the layout is easily able to respect
user-defined constraints and adapt to interaction in online systems and diagram
editors such as Dunnart."
"The popularity of touchscreen phones has been growing around the world since
the iPhones and Android phones were released. More and more mobile phones with
large touchscreen have been produced, however, the phones with small size
displays are still in the majority of touch phones. The foremost interface on
touch smartphones is the information input module using soft keyboards.
Traditional input methods on touch phones have either too small key buttons
(such as QWERTY) or too many functions (such as 3$\times$4 keyboard), which are
inconvenient to use. Moreover, the conventional soft keyboards only use tapping
to input texts while current touch smartphones allow various gestures on the
touchscreen, such as sliding. In this paper, a novel soft keyboard called QWERT
is proposed for touchscreen-based smartphones. The users can interact with
phones via finger gestures of tapping or sliding when input text by using the
QWERT. In doing so, the interactions between users and smartphones will be
faster and easier. An experiment carried out on inexperienced human subjects
shows that they can learn very fast due to their familiarities with QWERTY. A
simulation experiment based on a cognitive architecture, ACT-R, was also
conducted to predict the movement time (MT) of experienced human subjects. The
simulation results show that the MT using QWERT outperforms other default
keyboards. These outcomes imply that the novel QWERT is a viable option for
touch smartphone users. Based on the novel design, an application is released
on Android systems. This application is expected to give better user experience
for customers who use touch smartphones."
"Evaluating human-computer interaction is essential as a broadening population
uses machines, sometimes in sensitive contexts. However, traditional evaluation
methods may fail to combine real-time measures, an ""objective"" approach and
data contextualization. In this review we look at how adding neuroimaging
techniques can respond to such needs. We focus on electroencephalography (EEG),
as it could be handled effectively during a dedicated evaluation phase. We
identify workload, attention, vigilance, fatigue, error recognition, emotions,
engagement, flow and immersion as being recognizable by EEG. We find that
workload, attention and emotions assessments would benefit the most from EEG.
Moreover, we advocate to study further error recognition through neuroimaging
to enhance usability and increase user experience."
"This paper describes a framework for the investigation and modeling of human
spatial guidance behavior in complex environments. The model is derived from
the concept of interaction patterns, which represent the invariances or
symmetries inherent in the interactions between an agent and its environment.
These patterns provide the basic elements needed for the formalization of
spatial behavior and determine a natural hierarchy that can be unified under a
hierarchical hidden Markov model."
"Early experiments have suggested that program auralization can convey
information about program structure [8]. Languages like Pascal contain classes
of construct that are similar in nature allowing hierarchical classification of
their features. This taxonomy can be reflected in the design of musical
signatures which are used within the CAITLIN program auralization system.
Experiments using these hierarchical leitmotifs indicate whether or not their
similarities can be put to good use in communicating information about program
structure and state. (Note, at time of going to press experimental results
could not be included. These will be presented at the conference and included
later.)"
"This paper discusses {\ae}sthetic issues of sonifications and the
relationships between sonification (ars informatica) and music & sound art (ars
musica). It is posited that many sonifications have suffered from poor internal
ecological validity which makes listening more difficult, thereby resulting in
poorer data extraction and inference on the part of the listener. Lessons are
drawn from the electroacoustic music and musique concr\`ete communities as it
is argued that it is not instructive to distinguish between sonifications and
music/sound art."
"In this chapter we are concerned with external auditory representations of
programs, also known as program auralization. As program auralization systems
tend to use musical representations they are necessarily affected by artistic
and aesthetic considerations. Therefore, it is instructive to explore program
auralization in the light of aesthetic computing principles."
"In this paper we look at some of the design issues that affect the success of
multimodal displays that combine acoustic and haptic modalities. First, issues
affecting successful sonification design are explored and suggestions are made
about how the language of electroacoustic music can assist. Next, haptic
interaction is introduced in the light of this discussion, particularly
focusing on the roles of gesture and mimesis. Finally, some observations are
made regarding some of the issues that arise when the haptic and acoustic
modalities are combined in the interface. This paper looks at examples of where
auditory and haptic interaction have been successfully combined beyond the
strict confines of the human-computer application interface (musical
instruments in particular) and discusses lessons that may be drawn from these
domains and applied to the world of multimodal human-computer interaction. The
argument is made that combined haptic-auditory interaction schemes can be
thought of as musical instruments and some of the possible ramifications of
this are raised."
"Auditory display is concerned with the use of non-speech sound to communicate
information. If the term seems at first oxymoronic, then consider auditory
display as an activity of perceptualization, that is, the process of making
perceptible to humans aspects or features of a given data set or system. Most
commonly this is done using visual representations (which process we call
visualization) but it is not limited to the visual channel and recent years
have witnessed the increased use of auditory representations in the production
of tools for exploring data. By way of semiotics and an aesthetic perspective
shift this article posits that auditory display may be considered a form of
organized sound and explores the listening experience in this context."
"This essay, written in 1998 by an active participant in both virtual reality
development and the virtual reality definition debate, discusses the definition
of the phrase ""Virtual Reality"" (VR). I start with history from a personal
perspective, concentrating on the debate between the ""Virtual Reality"" and
""Virtual Environment"" labels in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Definitions
of VR based on specific technologies are shown to be unsatisfactory. I propose
the following definition of VR, based on the striking effects of a good VR
system: ""Virtual Reality is the use of computer technology to create the effect
of an interactive three-dimensional world in which the objects have a sense of
spatial presence."" The justification for this definition is discussed in
detail, and is favorably compared with the dictionary definitions of ""virtual""
and ""reality"". The implications of this definition for virtual reality
technology are briefly examined."
"Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field in which developer makes a user
friendly system. User can interact with a computer system without using any
conventional peripheral devices. Marker is used to recognize hand movement
accurately & successfully. Researchers establish the mechanism to interact with
computer system using computer vision. The interaction is better than normal
static keyboard and mouse. This paper represents most of innovative mechanisms
of the finger tracking used to interact with a computer system using computer
vision."
"Mobile devices gather the communication capabilities as no other gadget.
Plus, they now comprise a wider set of applications while still maintaining
reduced size and weight. They have started to include accessibility features
that enable the inclusion of disabled people. However, these inclusive efforts
still fall short considering the possibilities of such devices. This is mainly
due to the lack of interoperability and extensibility of current mobile
operating systems (OS). In this paper, we present a case study of a
multi-impaired person where access to basic mobile applications was provided in
an applicational basis. We outline the main flaws in current mobile OS and
suggest how these could further empower developers to provide accessibility
components. These could then be compounded to provide system-wide inclusion to
a wider range of (multi)-impairments."
"Mobile phones pervade our daily lives and play ever expanding roles in many
contexts. Their ubiquitousness makes them pivotal in empowering disabled
people. However, if no inclusive approaches are provided, it becomes a strong
vehicle of exclusion. Even though current solutions try to compensate for the
lack of sight, not all information reaches the blind user. Good spatial ability
is still required to make sense of the device and its interface, as well as the
need to memorize positions on screen or keys and associated actions in a
keypad. Those problems are compounded by many individual attributes such as
age, age of blindness onset or tactile sensitivity which often are forgotten by
designers. Worse, the entire blind population is recurrently thought of as
homogeneous (often stereotypically so). Thus all users face the same solutions,
ignoring their specific capabilities and needs. We usually ignore this
diversity as we have the ability to adapt and become experts in interfaces that
were probably maladjusted to begin with. This adaptation is not always within
reach. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which
widens this gap amongst blind people. It is paramount to understand the impact
of individual differences and their relationship with demands to enable the
deployment of more inclusive solutions. We explore individual differences among
blind people and assess how they are related with mobile interface demands,
both at low (e.g. performing an on-screen gesture) and high level (text-entry)
tasks. Results confirmed that different ability levels have significant impact
on the performance attained by a blind person. Particularly, otherwise ignored
attributes like tactile acuity, pressure sensitivity, spatial ability or verbal
IQ have shown to be matched with specific mobile demands and parametrizations."
"No two people are alike. We usually ignore this diversity as we have the
capability to adapt and, without noticing, become experts in interfaces that
were probably misadjusted to begin with. This adaptation is not always at the
user's reach. One neglected group is the blind. Spatial ability, memory, and
tactile sensitivity are some characteristics that diverge between users.
Regardless, all are presented with the same methods ignoring their capabilities
and needs. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which
widens the gap between blind people. Our research goal is to identify the
individual attributes that influence mobile interaction, considering the blind,
and match them with mobile interaction modalities in a comprehensive and
extensible design space. We aim to provide knowledge both for device design,
device prescription and interface adaptation."
"The use of information and communication technology in our day to day
activities is now unavoidable. In tourism developments, destination information
and management systems are used to guide visitors and provide information to
both visitors and management of the tour sites. In this paper, information and
navigation system was designed for tourists, taking some Niger state of Nigeria
tourism destinations into account. The information management system was
designed using Java Applet (NetBeans IDE 6.1), Hypertext MarkUp Language
(HTML), Personal Home Page (PHP), Java script and MySQL as the back-end
integration database. Two different MySQL servers were used, the MySQL query
browser and the WAMP5 server to compare the effectiveness of the system
developed."
"Mobile devices' user interfaces are still quite similar to traditional
interfaces offered by desktop computers, but those can be highly problematic
when used in a mobile context. Human gesture recognition in mobile interaction
appears as an important area to provide suitable on-the-move usability. We
present a body space based approach to improve mobile device interaction and
mobile performance, which we named as Mnemonical Body Shortcuts. The human body
is presented as a rich repository of meaningful relations which are always
available to interact with. These body-based gestures allow the user to
naturally interact with mobile devices with no movement limitations.
Preliminary studies using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology were
performed, validating Mnemonical Body Shortcuts as an appropriate new mobile
interaction mechanism. Following those studies, we developed inertial sensing
prototypes using an accelerometer, ending in the construction and user testing
of a gestural interface for mobile devices capable of properly recognizing
Mnemonical Body Shortcuts and also providing suitable user control mechanisms
and audio, visual and haptic feedback."
"Visually impaired people are often confronted with new environments and they
find themselves face to face with an innumerous amount of difficulties when
facing these environments. Having to surpass and deal with these difficulties
that arise with their condition is something that we can help diminish. They
are one sense down when trying to understand their surrounding environments and
gather information about what is happening around them. Nowadays, mobile
devices present significant computing and technological capacity which has been
increasing to the point where it is very common for most people to have access
to a device with Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and both high processing and storage
capacities. This allows us to think of applications that can do so much to help
people with difficulties. In the particular case of blind people, the lack of
visual information can be bypassed with other contextual information retrieved
by their own personal devices. Our goal is to provide information to blind
users, be able to give them information about the context that surrounds them.
We wanted to provide the blind users with the tools to create information and
be able to share this information between each other, information about people,
locations or objects. Our approach was to split the project into a data and
information gathering phase where we did our field search and interviewed and
elaborated on how is the situation of environment perception for blind users,
followed by a technical phase where we implement a system based on the first
stage. Our results gathered from both the collecting phase and our implementing
phase showed that there is potential to use these tools in the blind community
and that they welcome the possibilities and horizons that it opens them."
"Human-Computer Interaction with the traditional User Interface is done using
a specified in advance script dialog menu, mainly based on human intellect and
unproductive use of navigation. This approach does not lead to making
qualitative decision in control systems, where the situations and processes
cannot be structured in advance. Any dynamic changes in the controlled business
process (as example, in organizational unit of the information fuzzy control
system) make it necessary to modify the script dialogue in User Interface. This
circumstance leads to a redesign of the components of the User Interface and of
the entire control system. In the Intelligent User Interface, where the dialog
situations are unknown in advance, fuzzy structured and artificial intelligence
is crucial, the redesign described above is impossible. To solve this and other
problems, we propose the data, information and knowledge based technology of
Smart/ Intelligent User Interface (IUI) design, which interacts with users and
systems in natural and other languages, utilizing the principles of Situational
Control and Fuzzy Logic theories, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics,
Knowledge Base technologies and others. The proposed technology of IUI design
is defined by multi-agents of Situational Control and of data, information and
knowledge, modelling of Fuzzy Logic Inference, Generalization, Representation
and Explanation of knowledge, Planning and Decision-making, Dialog Control,
Reasoning and Systems Thinking, Fuzzy Control of organizational unit in
real-time, fuzzy conditions, heterogeneous domains, and multi-lingual
communication under uncertainty and in Fuzzy Environment."
"Canvas is a pixel-based inherently inaccessible element in HTML5.Therefore
web users with vision disabilities cannot benefit from Canvas and its desired
semantics and functionality. Regarding to the Canvas application in designing
interactive graphical user interface, vision-impaired users may miss important
information on web sites. This paper utilizes the content-based image retrieval
(CBIR) technique as well as code mapping embedded in a Firefox extension to
present a novel approach in order to make Canvas interactive user interface
accessible. This extension replaces Canvas with an accessible equivalent HTML
environment. Unlike previously done works on Canvas accessibility, the proposed
approach does not impose any rules on developers and designers during Canvas
design."
"Pen pressure is an input channel typically available in tablet pen device. To
date, little attention has been paid to the use of pressure in the domain of
graphical interaction, its usage largely limited to drawing and painting
program, typically for varying brush characteristic such as stroke width,
opacity and color. In this paper, we explore the use of pressure in 3D curve
drawing. The act of controlling pressure using pen, pencil and brush in real
life appears effortless, but to mimic this natural ability to control pressure
using a pressure sensitive pen in the realm of electronic medium is difficult.
Previous pressure based interaction work have proposed various signal
processing techniques to improve the accuracy in pressure control, but a
one-for-all signal processing solution tend not to work for different curve
types. We propose instead a framework which applies signal processing
techniques tuned to individual curve type. A neural network classifier is used
as a curve classifier. Based on the classification, a custom combination of
signal processing techniques is then applied. Results obtained point to the
feasibility and advantage of the approach."
"In this paper we present an approach for Human computer Interaction (HCI),
where we have tried to control the mouse cursor movement and click events of
the mouse using hand gestures. Hand gestures were acquired using a camera based
on colour detection technique. This method mainly focuses on the use of a Web
Camera to develop a virtual human computer interaction device in a cost
effective manner."
"The Semantic Alliance (SAlly) Framework, first presented at MKM 2012, allows
integration of Mathematical Knowledge Management services into typical
applications and end-user workflows. From an architecture allowing invasion of
spreadsheet programs, it grew into a middle-ware connecting spreadsheet, CAD,
text and image processing environments with MKM services. The architecture
presented in the original paper proved to be quite resilient as it is still
used today with only minor changes.
  This paper explores extensibility challenges we have encountered in the
process of developing new services and maintaining the plugins invading
end-user applications. After an analysis of the underlying problems, I present
an augmented version of the SAlly architecture that addresses these issues and
opens new opportunities for document type agnostic MKM services."
"Existing digital technologies in urban settings tend to focus narrowly on
concerns around wayfinding, safety, and consumption. In this paper, we examine
pedestrian experiences based on the data collected through field observations
as well as intensive interviews with nine pedestrians in the Shibuya area of
Tokyo, and suggest an alternative approach to blending technologies and urban
activities. Our focus is on social and cognitive aspects of pedestrians who get
lost and explore a labyrinth of sidewalks. We use the data to discuss the
activities that are often ignored or inadequately supported by existing
systems."
"This research presents an artistic project aiming to make cyberfiction become
reality and exemplifying a current trend in art and science collaborations.
Chroma+Phy is a speculative design for a living wearable that combines the
protoplasmic structure of the amoeboid acellular organism Physarum polycephalum
and the chromatophores of the reptile Chameleon. The underpin-ning idea is that
in a future far away or close, on planet earth or in outer space, humans will
need some tools to help them in their social life and day-to-day routine.
Chroma+Phy enhances the body aiming at humans in extreme habitats for an
aggression-free and healthy life. Our approach will address actual issues of
scientific discovery for society and catalyse idea translation through art and
design experiments at frontiers of science."
"Task taxonomies for graph and network visualizations focus on tasks commonly
encountered when analyzing graph connectivity and topology. However, in many
application fields such as the social sciences (social networks), biology
(protein interaction models), software engineering (program call graphs),
connectivity and topology information is intertwined with group, clustering,
and hierarchical information. Several recent visualization techniques, such as
BubbleSets, LineSets and GMap, make explicit use of grouping and clustering,
but evaluating such visualization has been difficult due to the lack of
standardized group-level tasks. With this in mind, our goal is to define a new
set of tasks that assess group-level comprehension. We propose several types of
group-level tasks and provide several examples of each type. Finally, we
characterize some of the proposed tasks using the multi-level typology of
abstract visualization tasks. We believe that adding group-level tasks to the
task taxonomy for graph visualization would make the taxonomy more useful for
the recent graph visualization techniques. It would help evaluators define and
categorize new tasks, and it would help generalize individual results collected
in controlled experiments."
"In recent years, the use of the automobile as the primary mode of
transportation has been increasing and driving has become an important part of
daily life. Driving is a multi-sensory experience as drivers rely on their
senses to provide them with important information. In a vehicular context human
senses are all too often limited and obstructed. Today, road accidents
constitute the eighth leading cause of death. The escalation of technology has
propelled new ways in which driver's senses may be augmented. The enclosed
aspect of a car, allied with the configuration of the controls and displays
directed towards the driver, offer significant advantages for augmented reality
(AR) systems when considering the amount of immersion it can provide to the
user. In addition, the inherent mobility and virtually unlimited power autonomy
transform cars into perfect mobile computing platforms. However, automobiles
currently present limited network connectivity and thus the created augmented
objects are merely providing information captured by in-vehicle sensors,
cameras and other databases. By combining the new paradigm of Vehicular Ad Hoc
Networking (VANET) with AR human machine interfaces, we show that it is
possible to design novel cooperative Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
that base the creation of AR content on the information collected from
neighbouring vehicles or roadside infrastructures. As such we implement
prototypes of both visual and acoustic AR systems, which can significantly
improve the driving experience. We believe our results contribute to the
formulation of a vision where the vehicle is perceived as an extension of the
body which permeates the human senses to the world outside the vessel, where
the car is used as a better, multi-sensory immersive version of a mobile phone
that integrates touch, vision and sound enhancements, leveraging unique
properties of VANET."
"We describe a completely automated large scale visual recommendation system
for fashion. Existing approaches have primarily relied on purely computational
models to solving this problem that ignore the role of users in the system. In
this paper, we propose to overcome this limitation by incorporating a
user-centric design of visual fashion recommendations. Specifically, we propose
a technique that augments 'user preferences' in models by exploiting elasticity
in fashion choices. We further design a user study on these choices and gather
results from the 'wisdom of crowd' for deeper analysis. Our key insights learnt
through these results suggest that fashion preferences when constrained to a
particular class, contain important behavioral signals that are often ignored
in recommendation design. Further, presence of such classes also reflect strong
correlations to visual perception which can be utilized to provide
aesthetically pleasing user experiences. Finally, we illustrate that user
approval of visual fashion recommendations can be substantially improved by
carefully incorporating these user-centric feedback into the system framework."
"We developed a prototype of touch-based survey tool for tablets and conducted
an experiment to compare interaction patterns of touch-based, PC-based, and
paper-based questionnaires. Our findings suggest that a touch-based interface
allows users to complete ranking questions easily, quickly, and accurately
although it can increase the time to complete a location input task for
well-known, prominent locations."
"This paper proposed a novel method to replace the traditional mouse
controller by using Microsoft Kinect Sensor to realize the functional
implementation on human-machine interaction. With human hand gestures and
movements, Kinect Sensor could accurately recognize the participants intention
and transmit our order to desktop or laptop. In addition, the trend in current
HCI market is giving the customer more freedom and experiencing feeling by
involving human cognitive factors more deeply. Kinect sensor receives the
motion cues continuously from the humans intention and feedback the reaction
during the experiments. The comparison accuracy between the hand movement and
mouse cursor demonstrates the efficiency for the proposed method. In addition,
the experimental results on hit rate in the game of Fruit Ninja and Shape
Touching proves the real-time ability of the proposed framework. The
performance evaluation built up a promise foundation for the further
applications in the field of human-machine interaction. The contribution of
this work is the expansion on hand gesture perception and early formulation on
Mac iPad."
"One of the issues of e-learning web based application is to understand how
the learner interacts with an e-learning application to perform a given task.
This study proposes a methodology to analyze learner mouse movement in order to
infer the task performed. To do this, a Hidden Markov Model is used for
modeling the interaction of the learner with an e-learning application. The
obtained results show the ability of our model to analyze the interaction in
order to recognize the task performed by the learner."
"As people become more concerned with the need to conserve their power
consumption we need to find ways to inform them of how electricity is being
consumed within the home. There are a number of devices that have been designed
using different forms, sizes, and technologies. We are interested in large
ambient displays that can be read at a glance and from a distance as
informative art. However, from these objectives come a number of questions that
need to be explored and answered. To what degree might lifestyle factors
influence the design of eco-visualizations? To answer this we need to ask how
people with varying lifestyle factors perceive the utility of such devices and
their placement within a home. We explore these questions by creating four
ambient display prototypes. We take our prototypes and subject them to a user
study to gain insight as to the questions posed above. This paper discusses our
prototypes in detail and the results and findings of our user study."
"A graph is a mathematical object consisting of a set of vertices and a set of
edges connecting vertices. Graphs can be drawn on paper in various ways, but
until recently all published methods of drawing graphs have had undesirable
properties: (i) for graphs which are not plane embeddable, intersections
between the lines representing edges appear at points which are not vertices,
creating the appearance of vertices where none exist, (ii) vertex labels can be
placed inside vertex symbols, but there is no consistent, logical, and visually
clean place to put edge labels, and (iii) representations of large graphs are
visually dense and difficult to interpret. This paper describes a new
cartographic method of drawing graphs which solves all of these problems, and
has other advantages as well. Complements, comparisons and contrasts of graphs
are usually better shown cartographically than in node-link form."
"Prototyping is an important part in research and development of tangible user
interfaces (TUIs). On the way from the idea to a working prototype, new
hardware prototypes usually have to be crafted repeatedly in numerous
iterations. This brings us to think about virtual prototypes that exhibit the
same functionality as a real TUI, but reduce the amount of time and resources
that have to be spent.
  Building upon existing open-source software - the middleware Robot Operating
System (ROS) and the 3D simulator Gazebo - we have created a toolkit that can
be used for developing and testing fully functional implementations of a
tangible user interface as a virtual device. The entire interaction between the
TUI and other hardware and software components is controlled by the middleware,
while the human interaction with the TUI can be explored using the 3D simulator
and 3D input/output technologies. We argue that by simulating parts of the
hardware-software co-design process, the overall development effort can be
reduced."
"(arXiv abridged abstract) In the last two decades, videogames have evolved in
a nearly explosive way from the pixelated graphics to today's near-realistic 3D
environments. The interaction devices traditionally used in videogames have not
evolved with the same intensity, but recent HCI studies have explored
biofeedback interaction - the explicit manipulation of a person's physiological
data as input to a system - as an alternative to them. Traditional biofeedback
prototypes apply 1 sensor to each game mechanic (unimodality).
  In this dissertation, we introduce the combination of 2 physiological sensors
simultaneously per game mechanic (multimodality) and present a First-Person
Shooter game comprised of 8 game mechanics with three interaction flavours (no
biofeedback/vanilla, unimodal and multimodal). An empirical study with 32
regular players was employed to explore and study differences between the three
interaction types and where they can be best employed.
  Players compared the three games in terms of Fun, Ease of Use, Originality,
Playability and Favourite Condition. For the sake of completeness, other
evaluation methods were used as well: IMI Questionnaire, keywords association
and open-ended commentaries. The vanilla version was considered easier to use,
but both biofeedback versions were considered the most fun. Both versions were
praised differently: the unimodal version for its simplicity of use, and the
multimodal for its realism, activation safety of game mechanics and depth added
to the game. Our conclusion is that multimodal biofeedback can have a relevant
impact in terms of added depth, depending on the way it is used inside the
game. On a boundary case, it can be used to increase the feeling of empowerment
on the player when using certain abilities, or to intentionally make in-game
actions more difficult by demanding more physical effort from the player."
"Recent developments in sensing technologies, mobile devices and context-aware
user interfaces have made it possible to represent information fusion and
situational awareness as a conversational process among actors - human and
machine agents - at or near the tactical edges of a network. Motivated by use
cases in the domain of security, policing and emergency response, this paper
presents an approach to information collection, fusion and sense-making based
on the use of natural language (NL) and controlled natural language (CNL) to
support richer forms of human-machine interaction. The approach uses a
conversational protocol to facilitate a flow of collaborative messages from NL
to CNL and back again in support of interactions such as: turning eyewitness
reports from human observers into actionable information (from both trained and
untrained sources); fusing information from humans and physical sensors (with
associated quality metadata); and assisting human analysts to make the best use
of available sensing assets in an area of interest (governed by management and
security policies). CNL is used as a common formal knowledge representation for
both machine and human agents to support reasoning, semantic information fusion
and generation of rationale for inferences, in ways that remain transparent to
human users. Examples are provided of various alternative styles for user
feedback, including NL, CNL and graphical feedback. A pilot experiment with
human subjects shows that a prototype conversational agent is able to gather
usable CNL information from untrained human subjects."
"Multimodality can make (especially mobile) device interaction more efficient.
Sensors and communication capabilities of modern smartphones and tablets lay
the technical basis for its implementation. Still, mobile platforms do not make
multimodal interaction support trivial. Building multimodal applications
requires various APIs with different paradigms, high-level interpretation of
contextual data, and a method for fusing individual inputs and outputs. To
reduce this effort, we created a framework that simplifies and accelerates the
creation of multimodal applications for prototyping and research. It provides
an abstraction of information representations in different modalities, unifies
access to implicit and explicit information, and wires together the logic
behind context-sensitive modality switches. In the paper, we present the
structure and features of our framework, and validate it by four implemented
demonstrations of different complexity."
"Fashion, and especially apparel, is the fastest-growing category in online
shopping. As consumers requires sensory experience especially for apparel goods
for which their appearance matters most, images play a key role not only in
conveying crucial information that is hard to express in text, but also in
affecting consumer's attitude and emotion towards the product. However,
research related to e-commerce product image has mostly focused on quality at
perceptual level, but not the quality of content, and the way of presenting.
This study aims to address the effectiveness of types of image in showcasing
fashion apparel in terms of its attractiveness, i.e. the ability to draw
consumer's attention, interest, and in return their engagement. We apply
advanced vision technique to quantize attractiveness using three common display
types in fashion filed, i.e. human model, mannequin, and flat. We perform
two-stage study by starting with large scale behavior data from real online
market, then moving to well designed user experiment to further deepen our
understandings on consumer's reasoning logic behind the action. We propose a
Fisher noncentral hypergeometric distribution based user choice model to
quantitatively evaluate user's preference. Further, we investigate the
potentials to leverage visual impact for a better search that caters to user's
preference. A visual attractiveness based re-ranking model that incorporates
both presentation efficacy and user preference is proposed. We show
quantitative improvement by promoting visual attractiveness into search on top
of relevance."
"This paper examines coordination in transparent work environments -
environments where the content of work artifacts, and the actions taken on
these artifacts, are fully visible to organizational members. Our qualitative
study of a community of open source software developers revealed a coordination
system characterized by interest-based, asynchronous interaction and knowledge
transfer. At the core of asynchronous knowledge transfer, lies the concept of
quasi-codification, which occurs when rich process knowledge is implicitly
encoded in work artifacts. Our findings suggest that members are able to more
selectively form dependencies, monitor the trajectory of projects, and make
their work understandable to others which facilitates coordination. We discuss
two important characteristics that enable coordination activities in a
transparent environment: the presence of an imagined audience that dictates the
way artifacts are crafted, and experience within the environment, that allows
individuals to derive knowledge from these artifacts. By showing how
transparency influences coordination, this research challenges previous
conceptions of coordination for complex, collaborative work."
"Under the assumptions that (i) gamification consists of various types of
users that experience game design elements differently; and (ii) gamification
is deployed in order to achieve some goal in the broadest sense, we pose the
gamification problem as that of assigning each user a game design element that
maximizes their expected contribution in order to achieve that goal. We show
that this problem reduces to a statistical learning problem and suggest matrix
factorization as one solution when user interaction data is given. The
hypothesis is that predictive models as intelligent tools for supporting users
in decision-making may also have potential to support the design process in
gamification."
"E-maintenance is a technology aiming to organize and structure the ICT during
the whole life cycle of the product, to develop a maintenance support system
that is effective and efficient. A current challenge of E-maintenance is the
development of generic visualization solutions for users responsible for the
maintenance. AR can be a potential technology for E-maintenance visualization,
since it can bring knowledge to the real physical world, to assist the
technician perform his/her work without the need to interrupt to consult
manuals for information. This paper proposes a methodology for the development
of advanced interfaces for human aware E-maintenance so that complex
maintenance processes can be made safer, better quality, faster, anytime and
anywhere."
"Background: Plant breeders are utilising an increasingly diverse range of
data types in order to identify lines that have desirable characteristics which
are suitable to be taken forward in plant breeding programmes. There are a
number of key morphological and physiological traits such as disease resistance
and yield that are required to be maintained, and improved upon if a commercial
variety is to be successful. Computational tools that provide the ability to
pull this data together, and integrate with pedigree structure, will enable
breeders to make better decisions on which plant lines are used in crossings to
meet both critical demands for increased yield/production and adaptation to
climate change. Results: We have used a large and unique set of experimental
barley (H. vulgare) data to develop a prototype pedigree visualization system
and performed a subjective user evaluation with domain experts to guide and
direct the development of an interactive pedigree visualization tool which we
have called Helium. Conclusions: We show that Helium allows users to easily
integrate a number of data types along with large plant pedigrees to offer an
integrated environment in which they can explore pedigree data. We have also
verified that users were happy with the abstract representation of pedigrees
that we have used in our visualization tool."
"Research in cell biology is steadily contributing new knowledge about many
different aspects of physiological processes like polymerization, both with
respect to the involved molecular structures as well as their related function.
Illustrations of the spatio-temporal development of such processes are not only
used in biomedical education, but also can serve scientists as an additional
platform for in-silico experiments. In this paper, we contribute a new,
three-level modeling approach to illustrate physiological processes from the
class of polymerization at different time scales. We integrate physical and
empirical modeling, according to which approach suits the different involved
levels of detail best, and we additionally enable a simple form of interactive
steering while the process is illustrated. We demonstrate the suitability of
our approach in the context of several polymerization processes and report from
a first evaluation with domain experts."
"Compared to real world tasks, completing tasks in a virtual environment (VE)
seldom involves the whole spectrum of skills the human body offers. User input
in a VE is commonly accomplished through simple finger gestures, such as
walking in a scene by simply pressing a button, even if this kind of
interaction is not very suitable. In order to create a more intuitive and
natural interaction, diverse projects try to tackle the problem of locomotion
in VEs by trying to enable a natural walking movement, which is also supposed
to increase the level of immersion. Existing solutions such as treadmills are
still expensive and need additional fixation of the body. In this paper, we
describe a simple and inexpensive way to build a useful locomotion interface
using a conventional sports stepper and an Arduino. This device enables control
in a VE by walking-in-place and without the need for any additional fixation
gadgets. We conducted a user study with 10 participants to evaluate the
impression on the joy and ease of use, immersion and reliability in comparison
to other interfaces used for locomotion, such as the Wii Balance Board and a
Wand Joystick. We found out that the stepper is experienced slightly better in
terms of immersion and joy of use. Furthermore, found that pressing buttons on
a Joystick was perceived to be more reliable."
"The analysis of user behavior in digital games has been aided by the
introduction of user telemetry in game development, which provides
unprecedented access to quantitative data on user behavior from the installed
game clients of the entire population of players. Player behavior telemetry
datasets can be exceptionally complex, with features recorded for a varying
population of users over a temporal segment that can reach years in duration.
Categorization of behaviors, whether through descriptive methods (e.g.
segmention) or unsupervised/supervised learning techniques, is valuable for
finding patterns in the behavioral data, and developing profiles that are
actionable to game developers. There are numerous methods for unsupervised
clustering of user behavior, e.g. k-means/c-means, Non-negative Matrix
Factorization, or Principal Component Analysis. Although all yield behavior
categorizations, interpretation of the resulting categories in terms of actual
play behavior can be difficult if not impossible. In this paper, a range of
unsupervised techniques are applied together with Archetypal Analysis to
develop behavioral clusters from playtime data of 70,014 World of Warcraft
players, covering a five year interval. The techniques are evaluated with
respect to their ability to develop actionable behavioral profiles from the
dataset."
"Non-intrusive presence detection of individuals in commercial buildings is
much easier to implement than intrusive methods such as passive infrared,
acoustic sensors, and camera. Individual power consumption, while providing
useful feedback and motivation for energy saving, can be used as a valuable
source for presence detection. We conduct pilot experiments in an office
setting to collect individual presence data by ultrasonic sensors, acceleration
sensors, and WiFi access points, in addition to the individual power monitoring
data. PresenceSense (PS), a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on power
measurement that trains itself with only unlabeled data, is proposed, analyzed
and evaluated in the study. Without any labeling efforts, which are usually
tedious and time consuming, PresenceSense outperforms popular models whose
parameters are optimized over a large training set. The results are interpreted
and potential applications of PresenceSense on other data sources are
discussed. The significance of this study attaches to space security, occupancy
behavior modeling, and energy saving of plug loads."
"Identifying locations of occupants is beneficial to energy management in
buildings. A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functional
areas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and room
level localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usage
reduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based upon
this observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person or
a mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,
however, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.
  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic
acoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for
infrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can be
characterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining precise
RIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of our
work are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system is
implemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm
is developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,
a comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted from
RIRs is performed. Also, SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of
ten (10) different rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstrates
the potential to be integrated into automatic mapping of building space."
"Pie menus are suggested as powerful tool for eye gaze based text entry among
various interfaces developed so far. If pie menus are used with multiple depth
layers then multiple saccades are required per selection of item, which is
inefficient because it consumes more time. Also dwell time selection method is
limited in performance because higher dwell time suffers from inefficiency
while lower one from inaccuracy. To overcome problems with multiple depth
layers and dwell time, we designed Quickpie, an interface for eye gaze based
text entry with only one depth layer of pie menu and selection border as
selection method instead of dwell time. We investigated various parameters like
number of slices in pie menu, width characters and safe region, enlarged angle
of slice and selection methods to achieve better performance. Our experiment
results indicates that six number of slices with width of characters area 120
px performs better as compared to other designs."
"Oculus rift: Virtual reality (VR) is a burgeoning field that has the inherent
potential of manipulating peoples mind with a superlative 3D experience. Oculus
rift is one such application that assists in achieving the same. With the
fleeting enhancements in VR it now seems very feasible to provide the user with
experiences that were earlier thought to be merely a dream or a nightmare."
"In general, Web pages are intended for large screen devices using HTML
technology. Admittance of such Web pages on Small Screen Devices (SSDs) like
mobile phones, palmtops, tablets, PDA etc., is increasing with the support of
the current wireless technologies. However, SSDs have limited screen size,
memory capacity and bandwidth, which makes accessing the Website on SSDs
extremely difficult. There are many approaches have been proposed in literature
to regenerate HTML Web pages suitable for browsing on SSDs. These proposed
methods involve segment the Web page based on its semantic structure, followed
by noise removal based on block features and to utilize the hierarchy of the
content element to regenerate a page suitable for Small Screen Devices. But
World Wide Web consortium stated that, HTML does not provide a better
description of semantic structure of the web page contents. To overcome this
draw backs, Web developers started to develop Web pages using new technologies
like XML, Flash etc. It makes a way for new research methods. Therefore, we
require an approach to reconstruct these Web pages suitable for SSDs. However,
existing approaches in literature do not perform well for Web pages erected
using XML and Flash. In this paper, we have emphasized a few issues of the
existing approaches on XML, Flash Datasets and propose an approach that
performs better on data set comprising of Flash Web pages."
"Using current sensing technology, a wealth of data on driving sessions is
potentially available through a combination of vehicle sensors and drivers'
physiology sensors (heart rate, breathing rate, skin temperature, etc.). Our
hypothesis is that it should be possible to exploit the combination of time
series produced by such multiple sensors during a driving session, in order to
(i) learn models of normal driving behaviour, and (ii) use such models to
detect important and potentially dangerous deviations from the norm in
real-time, and thus enable the generation of appropriate alerts. Crucially, we
believe that such models and interventions should and can be personalised and
tailor-made for each individual driver. As an initial step towards this goal,
in this paper we present techniques for assessing the impact of cognitive
distraction on drivers, based on simple time series analysis. We have tested
our method on a rich dataset of driving sessions, carried out in a professional
simulator, involving a panel of volunteer drivers. Each session included a
different type of cognitive distraction, and resulted in multiple time series
from a variety of on-board sensors as well as sensors worn by the driver.
Crucially, each driver also recorded an initial session with no distractions.
In our model, such initial session provides the baseline times series that make
it possible to quantitatively assess driver performance under distraction
conditions."
"This article presents the mathematical background of general interactive
systems. The first principle of designing a large system is to _divide and
conquer_, which implies that we could possibly reduce human error if we divided
a large system in smaller subsystems. Interactive systems are, however, often
composed of many subsystems that are _organically_ connected to one another and
thus difficult to divide. In other words, we cannot apply a framework of set
theory to the programming of interactive systems. We can overcome this
difficulty by applying a framework of category theory (Kleisli category) to the
programming, but this requires highly abstract mathematics, which is not very
popular. In this article we introduce the fundamental idea of category theory
using only lambda calculus, and then demonstrate how it can be used in the
practical design of an interactive system. Finally, we mention how this
discussion relates to category theory."
"Crowdsourcing can solve problems that current fully automated systems cannot.
Its effectiveness depends on the reliability, accuracy, and speed of the crowd
workers that drive it. These objectives are frequently at odds with one
another. For instance, how much time should workers be given to discover and
propose new solutions versus deliberate over those currently proposed? How do
we determine if discovering a new answer is appropriate at all? And how do we
manage workers who lack the expertise or attention needed to provide useful
input to a given task? We present a mechanism that uses distinct payoffs for
three possible worker actions---propose,vote, or abstain---to provide workers
with the necessary incentives to guarantee an effective (or even optimal)
balance between searching for new answers, assessing those currently available,
and, when they have insufficient expertise or insight for the task at hand,
abstaining. We provide a novel game theoretic analysis for this mechanism and
test it experimentally on an image---labeling problem and show that it allows a
system to reliably control the balance betweendiscovering new answers and
converging to existing ones."
"It has been suggested that people with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are
attracted to computer-mediated communication (CMC). In this study, several open
questions regarding CMC use in people with ASC which are investigated. We
compare CMC use in adults with high-functioning ASC (N = 113) and a control
group (N = 72). We find that people with ASC (1) spend more time on CMC than
controls, (2) are more positive about CMC, (3) report relatively high levels of
online social life satisfaction, and that (4) CMC use is negatively related to
satisfaction with life for people with ASC. Our results indicate that the ASC
subjects in this study use CMC at least as enthusiastically as controls, and
are proficient and successful in its use."
"This survey presents recent progress on Affective Computing (AC) using mobile
devices. AC has been one of the most active research topics for decades. The
primary limitation of traditional AC research refers to as impermeable
emotions. This criticism is prominent when emotions are investigated outside
social contexts. It is problematic because some emotions are directed at other
people and arise from interactions with them. The development of smart mobile
wearable devices (e.g., Apple Watch, Google Glass, iPhone, Fitbit) enables the
wild and natural study for AC in the aspect of computer science. This survey
emphasizes the AC study and system using smart wearable devices. Various
models, methodologies and systems are discussed in order to examine the state
of the art. Finally, we discuss remaining challenges and future works."
"With the explosion of social media in the last few years, web pages nowadays
include different social network buttons where users can express if they
support or recommend content. Those social buttons are very visual and their
presentations, along with the counters, mark the importance of the social
network and the interest on the content. In this paper, we analyze the presence
of four types of social buttons (Facebook, Twitter, Google+1, and LinkedIn) in
a large collection of web pages that we tracked over a period of time. We
report on the distribution and counts along with some characteristics per
domain. Finally, we outline some research directions."
"In a few months the computer mouse will be half-a-century-old. It is known to
have many drawbacks, the main ones being: loss of productivity due to constant
switching between keyboard and mouse, and health issues such as RSI. Like the
keyboard, it is an unnatural human-computer interface. However the vast
majority of computer users still use computer mice nowadays.
  In this article, we explore computer mouse alternatives. Our research shows
that moving the mouse cursor can be done efficiently with camera-based head
tracking system such as the SmartNav device, and mouse clicks can be emulated
in many complementary ways. We believe that computer users can increase their
productivity and improve their long-term health by using these alternatives."
"Traditional artworks like paintings, photographs, or films can be reproduced
by conventional media like printing or video. This makes visitors of museums
possible to purchase postcards, posters, books, and DVDs of pictures and/or
movies shown at the exhibition. However, newly developing arts so called
interactive art, or new media art, has not been able to be reproduced due to
limitation of functionalities of the conventional media. In this article, the
authors report a novel approach of sharing such interactive art outside the
exhibition, so that the visitors of the museum can take a copy to home, and
even share it with non-visitors. The authors build up their new
projector-and-camera (ProCam) based interactive artwork for exhibition at
Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (MOT) by using Apple's iPhone. The exactly
same software driving this artwork was downloadable from Apple's App Store --
thus all visitors or even non-visitors could enjoy the same experience at home
or wherever they like."
"With the growing technology, we humans always need something that stands out
from the other thing. Gestures are most desirable source to Communicate with
the Machines. Human Computer Interaction finds its importance when it comes to
working with the Human gestures to control the computer applications. Usually
we control the applications using mouse, keyboard, laser pointers etc. but,
with the recent advent in the technology it has even left behind their usage by
introducing more efficient techniques to control applications. There are many
Gesture Recognition techniques that have been implemented using image
processing in the past.
  However recognizing the gestures in the noisy background has always been a
difficult task to achieve. In the proposed system, we are going to use one such
technique called Augmentation in Image processing to control Media Player. We
will recognize Gestures using which we are going to control the operations on
Media player. Augmentation usually is one step ahead when it comes to virtual
reality. It has no restrictions on the background. Moreover it also does not
rely on certain things like gloves, color pointers etc. for recognizing the
gesture. This system mainly appeals to those users who always looks out for a
better option that makes their interaction with computer more simpler or
easier."
"This paper introduces the first wireless gesture recognition system that
operates using existingWi-Fi signals and devices. To achieve this, we first
identify limitations of existing wireless gesture recognition approaches that
limit their applicability to Wi-Fi. We then introduce algorithms that can
classify gestures using information that is readily available on Wi-Fi devices.
We demonstrate the feasibility of our design using a prototype implementation
on off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices. Our results show that we can achieve a
classification accuracy of 91% while classifying four gestures across six
participants, without the need for per-participant training. Finally, we show
the feasibility of gesture recognition in non-line-ofsight situations with the
participants interacting with a Wi-Fi device placed in a backpack."
"Virtual companions that interact with users in a socially complex environment
require a wide range of social skills. Displaying curiosity is simultaneously a
factor to improve a companion's believability and to unobtrusively affect the
user's activities over time. Curiosity represents a drive to know new things.
It is a major driving force for engaging learners in active learning. Existing
research work pays little attention in curiosity. In this paper, we enrich the
social skills of a virtual companion by infusing curiosity into its mental
model. A curious companion residing in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to
stimulate user's curiosity is proposed. The curious companion model is
developed based on multidisciplinary considerations. The effectiveness of the
curious companion is demonstrated by a preliminary field study."
"As far as Learning Management System is concerned, it offers an integrated
platform for educational materials, distribution and management of learning as
well as accessibility by a range of users including teachers, learners and
content makers especially for distance learning. Usability evaluation is
considered as one approach to assess the efficiency of e-Learning systems. It
is used to evaluate how well technology and tools are working for users. There
are some factors contributing as major reason why LMS is not used effectively
and regularly. Learning Management Systems, as major part of e-Learning
systems, can benefit from usability research to evaluate the LMS ease of use
and satisfaction among its handlers. Many academic institutions worldwide
prefer using their own customized Learning Management Systems; this is the case
with Moodle, an open source Learning Management Systems platform designed and
operated by most of the universities in Sri Lanka. This paper gives an overview
of Learning Management Systems used in Sri Lankan universities, and evaluates
its usability using some pre-defined usability standards. In addition it
measures the effectiveness of Learning Management System by testing the
Learning Management Systems. The findings and result of this study as well as
the testing are discussed and presented."
"Current layouts for alphabetic input on mobile phone keypads are very
inefficient. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) to find a suitable keypad
layout for each user, based on their personal text history. It incorporates
codes for frequent multigrams, which may be directly input. This greatly
reduces the average number of strokes required for typing. We optimize for
two-handed use, the left thumb covering the leftmost rows and vice versa. The
GA mini- mizes the number of strokes, consecutive use of the same key, and
consecutive use of the same hand. Using these criteria, the algorithm
re-arranges the 26 alphabetic characters, plus 14 additional multigrams, on the
10-key pad. We demonstrate that this arrangement can generate a more effective
layout, especially for SMS-style messages. Substantial savings are verified by
both computational analysis and human evaluation."
"We introduce Teegi, a Tangible ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) Interface that
enables novice users to get to know more about something as complex as brain
signals, in an easy, en- gaging and informative way. To this end, we have
designed a new system based on a unique combination of spatial aug- mented
reality, tangible interaction and real-time neurotech- nologies. With Teegi, a
user can visualize and analyze his or her own brain activity in real-time, on a
tangible character that can be easily manipulated, and with which it is
possible to interact. An exploration study has shown that interacting with
Teegi seems to be easy, motivating, reliable and infor- mative. Overall, this
suggests that Teegi is a promising and relevant training and mediation tool for
the general public."
"As modern industry shifts toward significant globalization, robust and
adaptable network capability is increasingly vital to the success of business
enterprises. Large quantities of information must be distilled and presented in
a single integrated picture in order to maintain the health, security and
performance of global networks. We present a design for a network situational
awareness display that visually aggregates large quantities of data, identifies
problems in a network, assesses their impact on critical company mission areas
and clarifies the utilization of resources. This display facilitates the
prioritization of network problems as they arise by explicitly depicting how
problems interrelate. It also serves to coordinate mitigation strategies with
members of a team."
"The role of immediate feedback in-group conversations has received scant
attention in the recent literature. While studies from the early 1990's
suggested that ""added information"" in the form of non-verbal cues would allow
video conferencing to ""augment"" the audio-only conference in terms of
effectiveness, stunningly little follow-on research has been done reflective of
the current state of computer mediated communication, video conferencing, ""live
walls"", etc. This article contrasts three studies of immediate feedback in
in-person settings as the basis for suggesting a new research program -
research to look at potential effects of augmenting video-conferencing with an
immediate feedback channel."
"Word clouds and text visualization is one of the recent most popular and
widely used types of visualizations. Despite the attractiveness and simplicity
of producing word clouds, they do not provide a thorough visualization for the
distribution of the underlying data. Therefore, it is important to redesign
word clouds for improving their design choices and to be able to do further
statistical analysis on data. In this paper we have proposed a fully automatic
redesigning algorithm for word cloud visualization. Our proposed method is able
to decode an input word cloud visualization and provides the raw data in the
form of a list of (word, value) pairs. To the best of our knowledge our work is
the first attempt to extract raw data from word cloud visualization. We have
tested our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results
of our experiments show that our algorithm is able to extract the words and
their weights effectively with considerable low error rate."
"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that measures central nervous
system activity and translates the recorded data into an output suitable for a
computer to use as an input signal. Such a BCI system consists of three parts,
the signal acquisition, the signal processing and the feedback/stimulus
presentation. In this paper we present Wyrm, a signal processing toolbox for
BCI in Python. Wyrm is applicable to a broad range of neuroscientific problems
and capable for running online experiments in real time and off-line data
analysis and visualisation."
"As smart phones and tablets are becoming ubiquitous and taking over as the
primary choice for accessing the Internet worldwide, ensuring a secure gateway
to the servers serving such devices become essential. CAPTCHAs play an
important role in identifying human users in internet to prevent unauthorized
bot attacks. Even though there are numerous CAPTCHA alternatives available
today, there are certain drawbacks attached with each alternative, making them
harder to find a general solution for the necessity of a CAPTCHA mechanism.
With the advancing technology and expertise in areas such as AI, cryptography
and image processing, it has come to a stage where the chase between making and
breaking CAPTCHAs are even now. This has led the humans with a hard time
deciphering the CAPTCHA mechanisms. In this paper, we adapt a novel CAPTCHA
mechanism named as LineCAPTCHA to mobile devices. LineCAPTCHA is a new reverse
Turing test based on drawing on top of Bezier curves within noisy backgrounds.
The major objective of this paper is to report the implementation and
evaluation of LineCAPTCHA on a mobile platform. At the same time we impose
certain security standards and security aspects for establishing LineCAPTCHAs
which are obtained through extensive measures. Independency from factors such
as the fluency in English language, age and easily understandable nature of it
inclines the usability of LineCAPTCHA. We believe that such independency will
favour the main target of LineCAPTCHA, user friendliness and usability."
"In this paper we present the evaluation process for Barbarossa, a pervasive
role playing game. Barbarossa involves an invitational (preparatory) and a main
execution phase. The former is freely available though Google Play store and
may be played anytime/ anywhere. The latter defines three inter-dependent
player roles acted by players who need to collaborate in a treasure hunting
game. The eligibility of players for participating in the main game phase is
restricted among those ranked relatively high in the invitational phase.
Herein, we investigate the impact of the invitational game mode on the players
overall game experience. The main hypothesis tested is that game awareness
(gained from participating in a preliminary game phase) may serve as a means
for recruiting the most suitable subjects for user trials on pervasive game
research prototypes."
"We present magnetic fingerprints; an input technique for mobile touchscreen
devices that uses a small magnet attached to a user's fingernail in order to
differentiate between a normal touch and a magnetic touch. The polarity of the
magnet can be used to create different magnetic fingerprints where this
technique takes advantage of the rich vocabulary offered by the use of
multitouch input. User studies investigate the accuracy of magnetic fingerprint
recognition in relation to magnet size, number of magnetic fingerprints used;
and size of the touchscreen. Studies found our technique to be limited to using
up to two fingerprints non-simultaneously, while achieving a high
classification accuracy (95%) but it nearly triples the number of
distinguishable multi touch events. Potential useful applications of this
technique are presented."
"We present WiGest: a system that leverages changes in WiFi signal strength to
sense in-air hand gestures around the user's mobile device. Compared to related
work, WiGest is unique in using standard WiFi equipment, with no
modi-fications, and no training for gesture recognition. The system identifies
different signal change primitives, from which we construct mutually
independent gesture families. These families can be mapped to distinguishable
application actions. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy
signals, gesture type and attributes detection, reducing false positives due to
interfering humans, and adapting to changing signal polarity. We implement a
proof-of-concept prototype using off-the-shelf laptops and extensively evaluate
the system in both an office environment and a typical apartment with standard
WiFi access points. Our results show that WiGest detects the basic primitives
with an accuracy of 87.5% using a single AP only, including through-the-wall
non-line-of-sight scenarios. This accuracy in-creases to 96% using three
overheard APs. In addition, when evaluating the system using a multi-media
player application, we achieve a classification accuracy of 96%. This accuracy
is robust to the presence of other interfering humans, highlighting WiGest's
ability to enable future ubiquitous hands-free gesture-based interaction with
mobile devices."
"We present a Software Keyboard for smart touchscreen devices that learns its
owner's unique dictionary in order to produce personalized typing predictions.
The learning process is accelerated by analysing user's past typed
communication. Moreover, personal temporal user behaviour is captured and
exploited in the prediction engine. Computational and storage issues are
addressed by dynamically forgetting words that the user no longer types. A
prototype implementation is available at Google Play Store."
"Cursor tracking data contains information about website visitors which may
provide new ways to understand visitors and their needs. This paper presents an
Amazon Mechanical Turk study where participants were tracked as they used
modified variants of the Wikipedia and BBC News websites. Participants were
asked to complete reading and information-finding tasks. The results showed
that it was possible to differentiate between users reading content and users
looking for information based on cursor data. The effects of website
aesthetics, user interest and cursor hardware were also analysed which showed
it was possible to identify hardware from cursor data, but no relationship
between cursor data and engagement was found. The implications of these
results, from the impact on web analytics to the design of experiments to
assess user engagement, are discussed."
"In this position paper, we present our approach of utilizing mobile devices
(i.e., mobile phones and tablets) for assisting engineers and experts in
understanding and maintaining the factory pipelines. For this, we present a
platform, called assistME, that is composed of three main components: the
assistME Server, the assistME mobile infrastructure, and the co-assistME
collaborative environment. In order to get full utilization of the assistME
platform, we assume that an initial setup is made in the factory in such a way
that it is equipped with different sensors to collect data about specific
events in the factory pipeline together with the corresponding locations of
these events. The assistME Server works as a central control unit in the
platform and collects data from the installed sensors in the factory pipeline.
In the case of any unexpected behavior or any critical situation in the factory
pipeline, notification and other details are sent to the related group of
engineers and experts through the assistME mobile app. Further, the co-assistME
collaborative environment, equipped with a large shared screen and multiple
mobile devices, helps the engineers and experts to collaborate with to
understand and analyze the current situation in the factory pipeline in order
to maintain it accurately."
"This article is about one feature which was partly introduced 30 years ago
with the development of multi windows operating systems. It is about the
movability of screen objects not according to some predetermined algorithm but
by the direct user action. Many years ago it was introduced on a very limited
basis and nothing was improved since then. Smartphones and tablets give direct
access to screen elements but on a very limited set of commands (scroll and
zoom). There is an easy to use algorithm which turns any screen object into
movable / resizable. This algorithm uses only mouse to turn screens of normal
PCs into touchscreens, but this simple change means a revolution in our work
with computers."
"P300 is an electric signal emitted by brain about 300 milliseconds after a
rare, but relevant-for-the-user event. One of the applications of this signal
is sentence spelling that enables subjects who lost the control of their motor
pathways to communicate by selecting characters in a matrix containing all the
alphabet symbols. Although this technology has made considerable progress in
the last years, it still suffers from both low communication rate and high
error rate. This article presents a P300 speller, named PolyMorph, that
introduces two major novelties in the field: the selection matrix polymorphism,
that reduces the size of the selection matrix itself by removing useless
symbols, and sentence-based predictions, that exploit all the spelt characters
of a sentence to determine the probability of a word. In order to measure the
effectiveness of the presented speller, we describe two sets of tests: the
first one in vivo and the second one in silico. The results of these
experiments suggest that the use of PolyMorph in place of the naive
character-by-character speller both increases the number of spelt characters
per time unit and reduces the error rate."
"Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) allow users to experience virtual reality with a
great level of immersion. However, even simple physical tasks like drinking a
beverage can be difficult and awkward while in a virtual reality experience. We
explore mixed reality renderings that selectively incorporate the physical
world into the virtual world for interactions with physical objects. We
conducted a user study comparing four rendering techniques that balances
immersion in a virtual world with ease of interaction with the physical world.
Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of each approach, suggesting guidelines
for future rendering techniques that bring physical objects into virtual
reality."
"According to Brooke* ""Usability does not exist in any absolute sense; it can
only be defined with reference to particular contexts."" That is, one cannot
speak of usability without specifying what that particular usability is
characterized by. Driven by the feedback of a reviewer at an international
conference, I explore in which way one can precisely specify the kind of
usability they are investigating in a given setting. Finally, I come up with a
formalism that defines usability as a quintuple comprising the elements level
of usability metrics, product, users, goals and context of use. Providing
concrete values for these elements then constitutes the investigated type of
usability. The use of this formalism is demonstrated in two case studies.

"Cartograms are maps in which areas of geographic regions (countries, states)
appear in proportion to some variable of interest (population, income).
Cartograms are popular visualizations for geo-referenced data that have been
around for over a century. Newspapers, magazines, textbooks, blogs, and
presentations frequently employ cartograms to show voting results, popularity,
and in general, geographic patterns. Despite the popularity of cartograms and
the large number of cartogram variants, there are very few studies evaluating
the effectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. In order to design
cartograms as a useful visualization tool and to be able to compare the
effectiveness of cartograms generated by different methods, we need to study
the nature of information conveyed and the specific tasks that can be performed
on cartograms. In this paper we consider a set of cartogram visualization
tasks, based on standard taxonomies from cartography and information
visualization. We then propose a cartogram task taxonomy that can be used to
organize not only the tasks considered here but also other tasks that might be
added later."
"Over the last years, most websites on which users can register (e.g., email
providers and social networks) adopted CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public
Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) as a countermeasure against
automated attacks. The battle of wits between designers and attackers of
CAPTCHAs led to current ones being annoying and hard to solve for users, while
still being vulnerable to automated attacks.
  In this paper, we propose CAPTCHaStar, a new image-based CAPTCHA that relies
on user interaction. This novel CAPTCHA leverages the innate human ability to
recognize shapes in a confused environment. We assess the effectiveness of our
proposal for the two key aspects for CAPTCHAs, i.e., usability, and resiliency
to automated attacks. In particular, we evaluated the usability, carrying out a
thorough user study, and we tested the resiliency of our proposal against
several types of automated attacks: traditional ones; designed ad-hoc for our
proposal; and based on machine learning. Compared to the state of the art, our
proposal is more user friendly (e.g., only some 35% of the users prefer current
solutions, such as text-based CAPTCHAs) and more resilient to automated
attacks."
"Traditionally, evaluation studies in information visualization have measured
effectiveness by assessing performance time and accuracy. More recently, there
has been a concerted effort to understand aspects beyond time and errors. In
this paper we study enjoyment, which, while arguably not the primary goal of
visualization, has been shown to impact performance and memorability. Different
models of enjoyment have been proposed in psychology, education and gaming; yet
there is no standard approach to evaluate and measure enjoyment in
visualization. In this paper we relate the flow model of Csikszentmihalyi to
Munzner's nested model of visualization evaluation and previous work in the
area. We suggest that, even though previous papers tackled individual elements
of flow, in order to understand what specifically makes a visualization
enjoyable, it might be necessary to measure all specific elements."
"There has been rapidly growing interest in studying and designing online
deliberative processes and technologies. This SIG aims at providing a venue for
continuous and constructive dialogue between social, political and cognitive
sciences as well as computer science, HCI, and CSCW. Through an online
community and a modified version of world cafe discussions, we contribute to
the definition of the theoretical building blocks, the identification of a
research agenda for the CHI community, and the network of individuals from
academia, industry, and the public sector who share interests in different
aspects of online deliberation."
"User Experience (UX) has been a buzzword in agile literature in recent years.
However, often UX remains as a vague concept and it may be hard to understand
the very nature of it in the context of agile software development. This paper
explores the multifaceted UX literature, emphasizes the multi-dimensional
nature of the concept and organizes the current state-of-the-art knowledge. As
a starting point to better understand the contemporary meaning of UX assigned
by practitioners, we selected four UX blogs and performed an analysis using a
framework derived from the literature review. The preliminary results show that
the practitioners more often focus on interaction between product and user and
view UX from design perspective predominantly. While the economical perspective
receives little attention in literature, it is evident in practitioners
writings. Our study opens up a promising line of request of the contemporary
meaning of UX in practice."
"For more then a decade the term User Experience (UX) has been highly debated
and defined in many ways. However, often UX remains as a vague concept and it
may be hard to understand the very nature of it. In this paper we aimed at
providing a better understanding of this concept. We explored the multi-faceted
UX literature, reviewing the current state-of- the-art knowledge and
emphasizing the multi-dimensional nature of the concept. Based on the
literature review we built a conceptual framework of UX using the elements that
are linked to it and reported in different studies. To show the potential use
of the framework, we examined the UX delivered by different phone applications
on different mobile devices using the elements in the framework. Several
interesting insights have been obtained in terms of how the phone applications
deliver different UX. Our study opens up a promising line of investigating the
contemporary meaning of UX."
"This study explores the use of natural language to give instructions that
might be interpreted by Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a domestic `smart
home' environment. We start from the proposition that reminders can be
considered as a type of end-user programming, in which the executed actions
might be performed either by an automated agent or by the author of the
reminder. We conducted an experiment in which people wrote sticky notes
specifying future actions in their home. In different conditions, these notes
were addressed to themselves, to others, or to a computer agent.We analyse the
linguistic features and strategies that are used to achieve these tasks,
including the use of graphical resources as an informal visual language. The
findings provide a basis for design guidance related to end-user development
for the Internet of Things."
"Given the choice, users produce passwords reflecting common strategies and
patterns that ease recall but offer uncertain and often weak security.
System-assigned passwords provide measurable security but suffer from poor
memorability. To address this usability-security tension, we argue that systems
should assign random passwords but also help with memorization and recall. We
investigate the feasibility of this approach with CuedR, a novel
cued-recognition authentication scheme that provides users with multiple cues
(visual, verbal, and spatial) and lets them choose the cues that best fit their
learning process for later recognition of system-assigned keywords. In our lab
study, all 37 of our participants could log in within three attempts one week
after registration (mean login time: 38.0 seconds). A pilot study on using
multiple CuedR passwords also showed 100% recall within three attempts. Based
on our results, we suggest appropriate applications for CuedR, such as
financial and e-commerce accounts."
"Get 'em Moles! is a single-player educational game inspired by the classic
arcade game Whac-A-Mole. Primarily designed for touchscreen devices, Get 'em
Moles! aims to teach English spelling and pronunciation through engaging game
play. This paper describes the game, design decisions in the form of elements
that support learning, preliminary play-testing results, and future work."
"These days mobile devices like phones or tablets are very common among people
of all age. They are connected with network and provide seamless communications
through internet or cellular services. These devices can be a big help for the
people who are not able to communicate properly and even in emergency
conditions. A disabled person who is not able to speak or a person who speak a
different language, these devices can be a boon for them as understanding,
translating and speaking systems for these people. This chapter discusses a
portable android based hand sign recognition system which can be used by
disabled people. This chapter shows a part of on-going project. Computer Vision
based techniques were used for image analysis and PCA was used after image
tokenizer for recognition. This method was tested with webcam results to make
system more robust."
"Patients with motor control difficulties often ""type"" on a computer using a
switch keyboard to guide a scanning cursor to text elements. We show how to
optimize some parts of the design of switch keyboards by casting the design
problem as mixed integer programming. A new algorithm to find an optimized
design solution is approximately 3600 times faster than a previous algorithm,
which was also susceptible to finding a non-optimal solution. The optimization
requires a model of the probability of an entry error, and we show how to build
such a model from experimental data. Example optimized keyboards are
demonstrated."
"Ubiquitous sensing is tightly coupled with activity recognition. This survey
reviews recent advances in Ubiquitous sensing and looks ahead on promising
future directions. In particular, Ubiquitous sensing crosses new barriers
giving us new ways to interact with the environment or to inspect our psyche.
Through sensing paradigms that parasitically utilise stimuli from the noise of
environmental, third-party pre-installed systems, sensing leaves the boundaries
of the personal domain. Compared to previous environmental sensing approaches,
these new systems mitigate high installation and placement cost by providing a
robustness towards process noise. On the other hand, sensing focuses inward and
attempts to capture mental activities such as cognitive load, fatigue or
emotion through advances in, for instance, eye-gaze sensing systems or
interpretation of body gesture or pose. This survey summarises these
developments and discusses current research questions and promising future
directions."
"Gesture typing is a method of text entry that is ergonomically well-suited to
the form factor of touchscreen devices and allows for much faster input than
tapping each letter individually. The QWERTY keyboard was, however, not
designed with gesture input in mind and its particular layout results in a high
frequency of gesture recognition errors. In this paper, we describe a new
approach to quantifying the frequency of gesture input recognition errors
through the use of modeling and simulating realistically imperfect user input.
We introduce new methodologies for modeling randomized gesture inputs,
efficiently reconstructing words from gestures on arbitrary keyboard layouts,
and using these in conjunction with a frequency weighted lexicon to perform
Monte Carlo evaluations of keyboard error rates or any other arbitrary metric.
An open source framework, Dodona, is also provided that allows for these
techniques to be easily employed and customized in the evaluation of a wide
spectrum of possible keyboards and input methods. Finally, we perform an
optimization procedure over permutations of the QWERTY keyboard to demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach and describe ways that future analyses can
build upon these results."
"Building practitioners (architects, engineers, energy managers) are showing a
growing interest in the design of more energy efficient and livable buildings.
The best way to predict how a building will behave regarding energy consumption
and thermal comfort is to use a dynamic simulation tool. However, the use of
this kind of tools is difficult on a daily basis practice due to the heuristic
and exploratory nature of the architectural design process. To deal with this
difficulty, the University of Coimbra and three companies have been working on
the development of a prototype design aiding tool, specifically devoted to the
space planning phase of building design, under the project GerAPlanO (Automatic
Generation of Architecture Floor plans with Energy Optimization). This project
aims to combine the capabilities of design generation techniques, thermal
assessment programs, and design optimization methods to provide assistance to
decision makers. This paper presents the overall concept, as well as the
current status of development of this tool."
"In this paper, we report a method of intuitively transmitting symbolic
information to untrained users via only their hands without using any visual or
auditory cues. Our simple concept is presenting three-dimensional letter
trajectories to the user's hand via a stylus which is mechanically manipulated.
By this simple method, in our experiments, participants were able to read 14
mm-high lower-case letters displayed at a rate of one letter per second with an
accuracy rate of 71.9% in their first trials, which was improved to 91.3% after
a five-minute training period. These results showed small individual
differences among participants (standard deviation of 12.7% in the first trials
and 6.7% after training). We also found that this accuracy was still retained
to a high level (85.1% with SD of 8.2%) even when the letters were reduced to a
height of 7 mm. Thus, we revealed that sighted adults potentially possess the
ability to read small letters accurately at normal writing speed using their
hands."
"The number of applications on online mobile application stores is increasing
at a rapid rate. Smart-phones are used by a wide range of people varying in
age, and also in the ability to use a smart phone. With the increasing
dependency on smart-phones, the paper aims to determine whether the popular
applications on Google Play, the official store for Android applications, can
be used by people with vision impairment. The accessibility of the applications
was tested using an external keyboard, and TalkBack, an accessibility tool
developed by Google. It was found that several popular applications on the
store were not designed keeping accessibility in mind. It was observed that
there exists a weak positive relationship between the popularity of the
application and its accessibility. A framework is proposed that can be used by
developers to improve the accessibility of an application. The paper also
discusses the programming aspects to be considered while developing an Android
application, so that the application can be used by sighted as well as visually
impaired users."
"In this article, we study the Cyber-Human Interaction (CHI) based approach
that the ""Human"" part sets a list of location-based objectives and makes the
pathway decision whereas the ""Cyber"" part provides the pathway suggestion,
infer heuristics from the environment along the pathway and incrementally
resolve the location-based objectives with new heuristics for indoor
localization. For this study, we implement a CHI-based system on mobile phone.
The CHI-based system offers the pathway suggestion and the solution of the
location-based objectives based on its trajectory management. Without any
priori knowledge on the area of interest and any aid from other equipments, a
laborer can achieve his location-based objectives by walking through the area
of interest and simultaneously online interacting with the CHI-based system
installed in his phone. In evaluation, we conduct the experiments and show the
advantage CHI in reducing the time cost and the expense cost for the laborer."
"This paper evaluates methods of hierarchical skill analysis developed in
aerospace to the problem of surgical skill assessment and modeling. The
analysis employs tool motion data of Fundamental of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS)
tasks collected from clinicians of various skill levels at three different
clinical teaching hospitals in the United States. Outcomes are evaluated based
on their ability to provide relevant information about the underlying processes
across the entire system hierarchy including control, guidance and planning."
"This paper shows the WEBVRGIS platform overlying multiple types of data about
Shenzhen over a 3d globe. The amount of information that can be visualized with
this platform is overwhelming, and the GIS-based navigational scheme allows to
have great flexibility to access the different available data sources. For
example,visualising historical and forecasted passenger volume at stations
could be very helpful when overlaid with other social data."
"Mobile devices with touch keyboards have become ubiquitous, but text entry on
these devices remains slow and errorprone. Understanding touch patterns during
text entry could be useful in designing robust error-correction algorithms for
soft keyboards. In this paper, we present an analysis of text input behaviors
on a soft QWERTY keyboard in three different text entry postures: index finger
only, one thumb, and two thumb. Our work expands on the work of [1] by
considering the entire surface area of digit contact with the smartphone
keyboard, rather than interpreting each touch as a single point. To do this, we
captured touch areas for every key in a lab study with 8 participants and
calculated offsets, error rates, and size measurements. We then repeated the
original experiment described in [1] and showed that significant differences
exist when basing offset calculations on touch area compared to touch points
for two postures."
"Cartograms are maps in which areas of geographic regions (countries, states)
appear in proportion to some variable of interest (population, income).
Cartograms are popular visualizations for geo-referenced data that have been
used for over a century and that make it possible to gain insight into patterns
and trends in the world around us. Despite the popularity of cartograms and the
large number of cartogram types, there are few studies evaluating the
effectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. Based on a recent task
taxonomy for cartograms, we evaluate four major different types of cartograms:
contiguous, non-contiguous, rectangular, and Dorling cartograms. Specifically,
we evaluate the effectiveness of these cartograms by quantitative performance
analysis, as well as by subjective preferences. We analyze the results of our
study in the context of some prevailing assumptions in the literature of
cartography and cognitive science. Finally, we make recommendations for the use
of different types of cartograms for different tasks and settings."
"This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 International Conference on
Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR2015). The purpose of this work is designing and
implementing a rehabilitation software for dysphonic patients. Constant
training is a key factor for this type of therapy. The patient can play the
game as well as conduct the voice training simultaneously guided by therapists
at clinic or exercise independently at home. The voice information can be
recorded and extracted for evaluating the long-time rehabilitation progress."
"This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 International Conference on
Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR2015). In this paper, we described the imagination
scenarios of a touch-less interaction technology for hemiplegia, which can
support either hand or foot interaction with the smartphone or head mounted
device (HMD). The computer vision interaction technology is implemented in our
previous work, which provides a core support for gesture interaction by
accurately detecting and tracking the hand or foot gesture. The patients
interact with the application using hand/foot gesture motion in the camera
view."
"Due to their privileged position halfway between the physical and the cyber
universes, user interfaces may play an important role in preventing,
tolerating, and learning from scenarios potentially affecting mission safety
and the user's quality of experience. This vision is embodied here in the main
ideas and a proof-of-concepts implementation of user interfaces that combine
dynamic profiling with context- and situation-awareness and autonomic software
adaptation."
"This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 9th International
Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare
(PervasiveHealth2015). An assistive training tool software for rehabilitation
of dysphonic patients is evaluated according to the practical clinical feedback
from the treatments. One stroke sufferer and one parkinson sufferer have
provided earnest suggestions for the improvement of our tool software. The
assistive tool employs a serious game as the attractive logic part, and running
on the tablet with normal microphone as input device. Seven pitch estimation
algorithms have been evaluated and compared with selected patients voice
database. A series of benchmarks have been generated during the evaluation
process for technology selection."
"This is the preprint version of our paper on Personal and Ubiquitous
Computing. There is an increasing interest in creating pervasive games based on
emerging interaction technologies. In order to develop touch-less, interactive
and augmented reality games on vision-based wearable device, a touch-less
motion interaction technology is designed and evaluated in this work. Users
interact with the augmented reality games with dynamic hands/feet gestures in
front of the camera, which triggers the interaction event to interact with the
virtual object in the scene. Three primitive augmented reality games with
eleven dynamic gestures are developed based on the proposed touch-less
interaction technology as proof. At last, a comparing evaluation is proposed to
demonstrate the social acceptability and usability of the touch-less approach,
running on a hybrid wearable framework or with Google Glass, as well as
workload assessment, user's emotions and satisfaction."
"Graph exploration and editing are still mostly considered independently and
systems to work with are not designed for todays interactive surfaces like
smartphones, tablets or tabletops. When developing a system for those modern
devices that supports both graph exploration and graph editing, it is necessary
to 1) identify what basic tasks need to be supported, 2) what interactions can
be used, and 3) how to map these tasks and interactions. This technical report
provides a list of basic interaction tasks for graph exploration and editing as
a result of an extensive system review. Moreover, different interaction
modalities of interactive surfaces are reviewed according to their interaction
vocabulary and further degrees of freedom that can be used to make interactions
distinguishable are discussed. Beyond the scope of graph exploration and
editing, we provide an approach for finding and evaluating a mapping from tasks
to interactions, that is generally applicable. Thus, this work acts as a
guideline for developing a system for graph exploration and editing that is
specifically designed for interactive surfaces."
"The aim of this study is to understand what are the collective actions of
architecture practitioners when grouping floor plan designs. The understanding
of how professionals and students solve this complex problem may help to
develop specific programmes for the teaching of architecture. In addition, the
findings of this study can help in the development of query mechanisms for
database retrieval of floor plans and the implementation of clustering
mechanisms to aggregate floor plans resulting from generative design methods.
The study aims to capture how practitioners define similarity between floor
plans from a pool of available designs. A hybrid evolutionary strategy is used,
which takes into account the building's functional program to generate
alternative floor plan designs. The first step of this methodology consisted in
an online survey to gather information on how the respondents would perform a
clustering task. Online surveys have been used in several applications and are
a method of data collection that conveys several advantages. When properly
developed and implemented, a survey portrays the characteristics of large
groups of respondents on a specific topic and allows assessing its
representation. Several types of surveys are available; e.g. questionnaire and
interview formats, phone survey, and online surveys, which can be coupled with
inference engines that act and direct the survey according to respondents'
answers. In the present study, the survey was posed as an online exercise in
which respondents had to perform a pre-defined task, which makes it similar to
running an experiment in an online environment. The experiment aimed to
understand the perception and criteria of the target population to perform the
clustering task by comparing the results with the respondents' answers to a
questionnaire presented at the end of the exercise."
"In the world where increasingly mobility and long-distance relationships with
family, friends and loved-ones became commonplace, there exists a gap in
intimate interpersonal communication mediated by technology. Considering the
advances in the field of mediation of relationships through technology, as well
as prevalence of use of jewelry as love-tokens for expressing a wish to be
remembered and to evoke the presence of the loved-one, developments in the new
field of computational jewelry offer some truly exciting possibilities. In this
paper we investigate the role that the jewelry-like form factor of prototypes
can play in the context of studying effects of computational jewelry in
mediating long-distance relationships."
"The integration of renewable energy sources increases the complexity in
mantaining the power grid. In particular, the highly dynamic nature of
generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy
resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved
through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential
overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of
this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is
nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid
and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an
interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in
order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze
data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain
insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems.
The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential
buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of
hardware measurement units and a management software. The Mj\""olnir framework,
which we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback
concepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying
disaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily
production and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an
advisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy
feedback."

"This paper studies the concept of color semantics by modeling a dataset of
magazine cover designs, evaluating the model via crowdsourcing, and
demonstrating several prototypes that facilitate color-related design tasks. We
investigate a probabilistic generative modeling framework that expresses
semantic concepts as a combination of color and word distributions
$-$color-word topics. We adopt an extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) topic modeling called LDA-dual to infer a set of color-word topics over a
corpus of 2,654 magazine covers spanning 71 distinct titles and 12 genres.
While LDA models text documents as distributions over word topics, we model
magazine covers as distributions over color-word topics. The results of our
crowdsourced experiments confirm that the model is able to successfully
discover the associations between colors and linguistic concepts. Finally, we
demonstrate several simple prototypes that apply the learned model to color
palette recommendation, design example retrieval, image retrieval, image color
selection, and image recoloring."
"Summarizing Likert scale ratings from human annotators is an important step
for collecting human judgments. In this project we study a novel, graph
theoretic method for this purpose. We also analyze a few interesting properties
for this approach using real annotation datasets."
"With stereoscopic displays, a depth sensation that is too strong could impede
visual comfort and result in fatigue or pain. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a
technology which records brain activity. We used it to develop a novel
brain-computer interface that monitors users' states in order to reduce visual
strain. We present the first proof-of-concept system that discriminates
comfortable conditions from uncomfortable ones during stereoscopic vision using
EEG. It reacts within 1s to depth variations, achieving 63% accuracy on average
and 74% when 7 consecutive variations are measured. This study could lead to
adaptive systems that automatically suit stereoscopic displays to users and
viewing conditions."
"One of the fundamental aspects of ubiquitous computing is the instrumentation
of the real world by smart devices. This instrumentation constitutes an
opportunity to rethink the interactions between human beings and their
environment on the one hand, and between the components of this environment on
the other. In this paper we discuss what this understanding of ubiquitous
computing can bring to geographic science and particularly to GIS technology.
Our main idea is the instrumentation of the geographic environment through the
instrumentation of geographic objects composing it. And then investigate how
this instrumentation can meet the current limitations of GIS technology, and
offers a new stage of rapprochement between the earth and its abstraction. As
result, the current research work proposes a new concept we named Smart
Geographic Object SGO. The latter is a convergence point between the smart
objects and geographic objects, two concepts appertaining respectively to t"
"A human computation system can be viewed as a distributed system in which the
processors are humans, called workers. Such systems harness the cognitive power
of a group of workers connected to the Internet to execute relatively simple
tasks, whose solutions, once grouped, solve a problem that systems equipped
with only machines could not solve satisfactorily. Examples of such systems are
Amazon Mechanical Turk and the Zooniverse platform. A human computation
application comprises a group of tasks, each of them can be performed by one
worker. Tasks might have dependencies among each other. In this study, we
propose a theoretical framework to analyze such type of application from a
distributed systems point of view. Our framework is established on three
dimensions that represent different perspectives in which human computation
applications can be approached: quality-of-service requirements, design and
management strategies, and human aspects. By using this framework, we review
human computation in the perspective of programmers seeking to improve the
design of human computation applications and managers seeking to increase the
effectiveness of human computation infrastructures in running such
applications. In doing so, besides integrating and organizing what has been
done in this direction, we also put into perspective the fact that the human
aspects of the workers in such systems introduce new challenges in terms of,
for example, task assignment, dependency management, and fault prevention and
tolerance. We discuss how they are related to distributed systems and other
areas of knowledge."
"In the last years several solutions were proposed to support people with
visual impairments or blindness during road crossing. These solutions focus on
computer vision techniques for recognizing pedestrian crosswalks and computing
their relative position from the user. Instead, this contribution addresses a
different problem; the design of an auditory interface that can effectively
guide the user during road crossing. Two original auditory guiding modes based
on data sonification are presented and compared with a guiding mode based on
speech messages.
  Experimental evaluation shows that there is no guiding mode that is best
suited for all test subjects. The average time to align and cross is not
significantly different among the three guiding modes, and test subjects
distribute their preferences for the best guiding mode almost uniformly among
the three solutions. From the experiments it also emerges that higher effort is
necessary for decoding the sonified instructions if compared to the speech
instructions, and that test subjects require frequent `hints' (in the form of
speech messages). Despite this, more than 2/3 of test subjects prefer one of
the two guiding modes based on sonification. There are two main reasons for
this: firstly, with speech messages it is harder to hear the sound of the
environment, and secondly sonified messages convey information about the
""quantity"" of the expected movement."
"As online health communities (OHCs) grow, users find it challenging to
properly search, read, and contribute to the community because of its
overwhelming content. Our goal is to understand OHC users' needs and
requirements for better delivering large-scale OHC content. We interviewed 14
OHC users with interests in diabetes to investigate their attitudes and needs
towards using OHCs and 2 OHC administrators to assess our findings. Four
personas -Coddlers, Scientists, Adventurers, and Opportunists- emerged, which
inform users' interaction behavior and attitudes with OHCs. An individual can
possess the characteristics of multiple personas, which can also change over
time. Our personas uniquely describe users' OHC participation intertwined with
illness contexts compared to existing social types in general online
communities. We discuss broader implications back to the literature and how our
findings apply to other illness contexts in OHCs. We end with requirements for
personalized delivery of large-scale OHC content."
"Fall is one of the major health threats and obstacles to independent living
for elders, timely and reliable fall detection is crucial for mitigating the
effects of falls. In this paper, leveraging the fine-grained Channel State
Information (CSI) and multi-antenna setting in commodity WiFi devices, we
design and implement a real-time, non-intrusive, and low-cost indoor fall
detector, called Anti-Fall. For the first time, the CSI phase difference over
two antennas is identified as the salient feature to reliably segment the fall
and fall-like activities, both phase and amplitude information of CSI is then
exploited to accurately separate the fall from other fall-like activities.
Experimental results in two indoor scenarios demonstrate that Anti-Fall
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall, with 10% higher
detection rate and 10% less false alarm rate on average."
"Taking a picture has been traditionally a one-persons task. In this paper we
present a novel system that allows multiple mobile devices to work
collaboratively in a synchronized fashion to capture a panorama of a highly
dynamic scene, creating an entirely new photography experience that encourages
social interactions and teamwork. Our system contains two components: a client
app that runs on all participating devices, and a server program that monitors
and communicates with each device. In a capturing session, the server collects
in realtime the viewfinder images of all devices and stitches them on-the-fly
to create a panorama preview, which is then streamed to all devices as visual
guidance. The system also allows one camera to be the host and to send direct
visual instructions to others to guide camera adjustment. When ready, all
devices take pictures at the same time for panorama stitching. Our preliminary
study suggests that the proposed system can help users capture high quality
panoramas with an enjoyable teamwork experience.

"Camera arrays (CamArrays) are widely used in commercial filming projects for
achieving special visual effects such as bullet time effect, but are very
expensive to set up. We propose CamSwarm, a low-cost and lightweight
alternative to professional CamArrays for consumer applications. It allows the
construction of a collaborative photography platform from multiple mobile
devices anywhere and anytime, enabling new capturing and editing experiences
that a single camera cannot provide. Our system allows easy team formation;
uses real-time visualization and feedback to guide camera positioning; provides
a mechanism for synchronized capturing; and finally allows the user to
efficiently browse and edit the captured imagery. Our user study suggests that
CamSwarm is easy to use; the provided real-time guidance is helpful; and the
full system achieves high quality results promising for non-professional use.

"A demandance is a psychological ""pull"" exerted by a stimulus. It is closely
related to the theory of ""affordance"". I introduce the theory of demandance,
offer some motivating examples, briefly explore its psychological basis, and
examine some implications of the theory. I exemplify some of the positive and
negative implications of demandances for design, with special attention to
young children and the design of educational products and practices. I suggest
that demandance offers an approach to one of the persistent mysteries of the
theory of affordance, specifically: Given that there may be many affordances in
any particular setting, how do we choose which to actually act upon?"
"For many applications, such as targeted advertising and content
recommendation, knowing users' traits and interests is a prerequisite. User
profiling is a helpful approach for this purpose. However, current methods,
i.e. self-reporting, web-activity monitoring and social media mining are either
intrusive or require data over long periods of time. Recently, there is growing
evidence in cognitive science that a variety of users' profile is significantly
correlated with eye-tracking data. We propose a novel just-in-time implicit
profiling method, Eye-2-I, which learns the user's interests, demographic and
personality traits from the eye-tracking data while the user is watching
videos. Although seemingly conspicuous by closely monitoring the user's eye
behaviors, our method is unobtrusive and privacy-preserving owing to its unique
characteristics, including (1) fast speed - the profile is available by the
first video shot, typically few seconds, and (2) self-contained - not relying
on historical data or functional modules. [Bug found. As a proof-of-concept,
our method is evaluated in a user study with 51 subjects. It achieved a mean
accuracy of 0.89 on 37 attributes of user profile with 9 minutes of
eye-tracking data.]"
"Understanding the quality and usage of public transportation resources is
important for schedule optimization and resource allocation. Ridership and
adherence are the two main dimensions for evaluating the quality of service.
Using Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), Automatic Passenger Count (APC), and
Global Positioning System (GPS) data, ridership data and adherence data of
public transportation can be collected. In this paper, we discuss the
development of a visualization tool for exploring public transportation data.
We introduce ""map view"" and ""route view"" to help users locate stops in the
context of geography and route information. To visualize ridership and
adherence information over several years, we introduce ""calendar view"" - a
miniaturized calendar that provides an overview of data where users can
interactively select specific days to explore individual trips and stops (""trip
subview"" and ""stop subview""). MetroViz was evaluated via a series of usability
tests that included researchers from the Center for Advanced Transportation
Technology (CATT) and students from the University of Maryland - College Park
in which test participants used the tool to explore three years of bus transit
data from Blacksburg, Virginia."
"Mobile is taking center stage and becoming the device of preference for all
aspects of communication because of our increasingly on the go lifestyles. With
this the demands on mobile capability to execute increasingly complex
operations are also on the rise. However, despite improvements in device
computing power in the last couple of years a mobile device continues to have
limitations. Mobile driven everyday use cases are increasingly raising
expectations that rest on mobile technologies that are still evolving. A number
of fragmented approaches and solutions have been created that address various
requirements unique to mobility, however there is a lack of a single framework
that serves as a unifying reference for industry and solution architectures.
The paper addresses this concern through the specification of a comprehensive
reference framework for mobility that is generic and vendor neutral."
"Three-dimension will be a characteristic of future user interfaces, although
we are just starting to gain an understanding of how users can navigate and
share information within a virtual 3D environment. Three-dimensional graphical
user interfaces (3D-GUI) raise many issues of design, metaphor and usability.
This research is devoted to designing a 3D-GUI as a front-end tool for a file
management system, in this case, for Microsoft Windows\c{opyright} Explorer; as
well as evaluating the efficiency of a 3D application. The software design was
implemented by extending the Half-Life 3D engine. This extension provides a
directory traversal and basic file management functions, like cut, copy, paste,
delete, and so on. This paper shows the design and implementation of a
real-world application that contains an efficient 3D-GUI."
"We describe a new visualization tool, dubbed HCMapper, that visually helps to
compare a pair of dendrograms computed on the same dataset by displaying
multiscale partition-based layered structures. The dendrograms are obtained by
hierarchical clustering techniques whose output reflects some hypothesis on the
data and HCMapper is specifically designed to grasp at first glance both
whether the two compared hypotheses broadly agree and the data points on which
they do not concur. Leveraging juxtaposition and explicit encodings, HCMapper
focus on two selected partitions while displaying coarser ones in context areas
for understanding multiscale structure and eventually switching the selected
partitions. HCMapper utility is shown through the example of testing whether
the prices of credit default swap financial time series only undergo
correlation. This use case is detailed in the supplementary material as well as
experiments with code on toy-datasets for reproducible research. HCMapper is
currently released as a visualization tool on the DataGrapple time series and

"In this paper we introduce a paradigm for completing complex tasks from
wearable devices by leveraging crowdsourcing, and demonstrate its validity for
academic writing. We explore this paradigm using a collaborative authoring
system, called WearWrite, which is designed to enable authors and crowd workers
to work together using an Android smartwatch and Google Docs to produce
academic papers, including this one. WearWrite allows expert authors who do not
have access to large devices to contribute bits of expertise and big picture
direction from their watch, while freeing them of the obligation of integrating
their contributions into the overall document. Crowd workers on desktop
computers actually write the document. We used this approach to write several
simple papers, and found it was effective at producing reasonable drafts.
However, the workers often needed more structure and the authors more context.
WearWrite addresses these issues by focusing workers on specific tasks and
providing select context to authors on the watch. We demonstrate the system's
feasibility by writing this paper using it."
"People often have difficulty to take pictures of animals, since animals
usually do not react with cameras nor understand verbal directions. To solve
this problem, we developed a new interaction technique, AnimalCatcher, which
can attract animals' attention easily. The AnimalCatcher shoots various sounds

describes concepts, implementation, and example pictures taken in a zoo."
"Researchers and experts are taking efforts in delivering an optimal user
experience from a long time. Computer interfaces are being developed to keep
user 'in the flow' as well as for making users more connected to the real world
wile using virtual environment. Developing ubiquitous user interfaces for
novices and experts at the same time is crucial work for interaction designers.
This paper molds the designing approach of user interfaces in bit different
parameters by reviewing the existing literature and proposing a different way
to develop a smart user interface to make user more familiar with the design
and to keep user 'in the flow'. Contextually proximate approach (CPA) will help
users to minimize their feeling of insecurity as designing process includes
local resources of users to develop the user interfaces. These various
resources and parameters are explained further in the paper by giving different
examples."
"In this paper we present a method which aims to improve the spelling of
children with dyslexia through playful and targeted exercises. In contrast to
previous approaches, our method does not use correct words or positive examples
to follow, but presents the child a misspelled word as an exercise to solve. We
created these training exercises on the basis of the linguistic knowledge
extracted from the errors found in texts written by children with dyslexia. To
test the effectiveness of this method in Spanish, we integrated the exercises
in a game for iPad, DysEggxia (Piruletras in Spanish), and carried out a
within-subject experiment. During eight weeks, 48 children played either
DysEggxia or Word Search, which is another word game. We conducted tests and
questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after four weeks when the games
were switched, and at the end of the study. The children who played DysEggxia
for four weeks in a row had significantly less writing errors in the tests that
after playing Word Search for the same time. This provides evidence that
error-based exercises presented in a tablet help children with dyslexia improve
their spelling skills."
"Recently datasets that contain sentence descriptions of images have enabled
models that can automatically generate image captions. However, collecting
these datasets are still very expensive. Here, we present SentenceRacer, an
online game that gathers and verifies descriptions of images at no cost.
Similar to the game hangman, players compete to uncover words in a sentence
that ultimately describes an image. SentenceRacer both generates and verifies
that the sentences are accurate descriptions. We show that SentenceRacer
generates annotations of higher quality than those generated on Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT)."

to enhance the immersive perception of the users."
"In recent times, there have been significant advancements in utilizing the
sensing capabilities of mobile devices for developing applications. The primary
objective has been to enhance the way a user interacts with the application by
making it effortless and convenient. This paper explores the capabilities of
using Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), an evolving subset of Human Computer
Interaction (HCI) paradigms, to control mobile devices. We present a
comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in this area, discussing the
challenges and limitations in using BCI for mobile applications. Further we
propose possible modalities that in future can benefit with BCI applications.
This paper consolidates research directions being pursued in this domain, and
draws conclusions on feasibility and benefits of using BCI systems effectively
augmented to the mobile application development domain."

"We explain and provide examples of a formalism that supports the methodology
of discovering how to adapt and personalize technology by combining randomized
experiments with variables associated with user models. We characterize a
formal relationship between the use of technology to conduct A/B experiments
and use of technology for adaptive personalization. The MOOClet Formalism [11]
captures the equivalence between experimentation and personalization in its
conceptualization of modular components of a technology. This motivates a
unified software design pattern that enables technology components that can be
compared in an experiment to also be adapted based on contextual data, or
personalized based on user characteristics. With the aid of a concrete use
case, we illustrate the potential of the MOOClet formalism for a methodology
that uses randomized experiments of alternative micro-designs to discover how
to adapt technology based on user characteristics, and then dynamically
implements these personalized improvements in real time."
"The Emoti-Chair is a novel technology to enhance entertainment through

vibetracks for a movie clip using a professional movie editing software. In the
second workshop, trained opera singers sang and felt their voice through the
Emoti-Chair. Participants in both workshops generally found the overall

"In real settings, natural body movements can be erroneously recognized by
whole-body input systems as explicit input actions. We call body activity not
intended as input actions ""background activity."" We argue that understanding
background activity is crucial to the success of always-available whole-body
input in the real world. To operationalize this argument, we contribute a
reusable study methodology and software tools to generate standardized
background activity datasets composed of data from multiple Kinect cameras, a
Vicon tracker, and two high-definition video cameras. Using our methodology, we
create an example background activity dataset for a television-oriented living
room setting. We use this dataset to demonstrate how it can be used to redesign
a gestural interaction vocabulary to minimize conflicts with the real world.
The software tools and initial living room dataset are publicly available

to transfer the stereoscopic images of the 3D game to the screen of the

"In our research, we attempt to help people recognize their brain state of
concentration or relaxation more conveniently and in real time. Considering the
inconvenience of wearing traditional multiple electrode electroencephalographs,
we choose Muse to collect data which is a portable headband launched lately
with a number of useful functions and channels and it is much easier for the
public to use. Besides, traditional online analysis did not focus on the
synchronism between users and computers and the time delay problem did exist.
To solve the problem, by building the Analytic Hierarchy Model, we choose the
two gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 as the data source instead of using both
beta and alpha channels traditionally.Using the Common Space Pattern algorithm
and the Support Vector Machine model, the channels we choose have a higher
recognition accuracy rate and smaller amount of data to be dealt with by the
computer than the traditional ones. Furthermore, we make use of the Feedforward
Neural Network Model to predict subjects'brain states in half a second.
Finally, we design a plane program in Python where a plane can be controlled to
go up or down when users concentrate or relax. The SVM model and the
Feedforward Neural Network model have both been tested by 12 subjects and they
give an evaluation ranging from 1 to 10 points. The former gets 7.58 points
while the latter gets 8.83, which proves that the time delay problem is
improved once more."
"With the development of the modern society, mind control applied to both the
recovery of disabled individuals and auxiliary control of normal people has
obtained great attention in numerous researches. In our research, we attempt to
recognize the brain waves of left and right hand movement imagery with portable
electroencephalographs. Considering the inconvenience of wearing traditional
multiple-electrode electroencephalographs, we choose Muse to collect data which
is a portable headband launched lately with a number of useful functions and
channels and it is much easier for the public to use. Additionally, previous
researches generally focused on discrimination of EEG of left and right hand
movement imagery by using data from C3 and C4 electrodes which locate on the
top of the head. However, we choose the gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 and
obtain data when subjects imagine their left or right hand to move with their
eyeballs rotated in the corresponding direction. With the help of the Common
Space Pattern algorithm to extract features of brain waves between left and
right hand movement imagery, we make use of the Support Vector Machine to
classify different brain waves. Traditionally, the accuracy rate of
classification was approximately 90% using the EEG data from C3 and C4
electrode poles; however, the accuracy rate reaches 95.1% by using the gamma
wave data from F7 and F8 in our experiment. Finally, we design a plane program
in Python where a plane can be controlled to go left or right when users
imagine their left or right hand to move. 8 subjects are tested and all of them
can control the plane flexibly which reveals that our model can be applied to
control hardware which is useful for disabled individuals and normal people."
"At the beginning, programming was inspired by the search of the best
solutions. At that time some fundamental stones like famous languages and
object oriented and structured programming were laid. It was found later that
applications could generate huge profits; after it marketing departments
started to decide what was right and wrong. Programs are ruled by developers
but declared user-friendly; millions of users are going mad trying to get the
needed results from these applications. Research goes on and new results can be
opposite to business view. History shows that not science has to adjust to
business, but eventually business will have to adapt to the results of the
research work."

"Increase in workload across many organisations and consequent increase in
occupational stress is negatively affecting the health of the workforce.
Measuring stress and other human psychological dynamics is difficult due to
subjective nature of self- reporting and variability between and within
individuals. With the advent of smartphones it is now possible to monitor
diverse aspects of human behaviour, including objectively measured behaviour
related to psychological state and consequently stress. We have used data from
the smartphone's built-in accelerometer to detect behaviour that correlates
with subjects stress levels. Accelerometer sensor was chosen because it raises
fewer privacy concerns (in comparison to location, video or audio recording,
for example) and because its low power consumption makes it suitable to be
embedded in smaller wearable devices, such as fitness trackers. 30 subjects
from two different organizations were provided with smartphones. The study
lasted for 8 weeks and was conducted in real working environments, with no
constraints whatsoever placed upon smartphone usage. The subjects reported
their perceived stress levels three times during their working hours. Using
combination of statistical models to classify self reported stress levels, we
achieved a maximum overall accuracy of 71% for user-specific models and an
accuracy of 60% for the use of similar-users models, relying solely on data
from a single accelerometer."
"High performance computing (HPC) has driven collaborative science discovery
for decades. Exascale computing platforms, currently in the design stage, will
be deployed around 2022. The next generation of supercomputers is expected to
utilize radically different computational paradigms, necessitating fundamental
changes in how the community of scientific users will make the most efficient
use of these powerful machines. However, there have been few studies of how
scientists work with exascale or close-to-exascale HPC systems. Time as a
metaphor is so pervasive in the discussions and valuation of computing within
the HPC community that it is worthy of close study. We utilize time as a lens
to conduct an ethnographic study of scientists interacting with HPC systems. We
build upon recent CSCW work to consider temporal rhythms and collective time
within the HPC sociotechnical ecosystem and provide considerations for future
system design."
"The fact that emotions play a vital role in social interactions, along with
the demand for novel human-computer interaction applications, have led to the
development of a number of automatic emotion classification systems. However,
it is still debatable whether the performance of such systems can compare with
human coders. To address this issue, in this study, we present a comprehensive
comparison in a speech-based emotion classification task between 138 Amazon
Mechanical Turk workers (Turkers) and a state-of-the-art automatic computer
system. The comparison includes classifying speech utterances into six emotions
(happy, neutral, sad, anger, disgust and fear), into three arousal classes
(active, passive, and neutral), and into three valence classes (positive,
negative, and neutral). The results show that the computer system outperforms
the naive Turkers in almost all cases. Furthermore, the computer system can
increase the classification accuracy by rejecting to classify utterances for
which it is not confident, while the Turkers do not show a significantly higher
classification accuracy on their confident utterances versus unconfident ones."
"EEG-based workload estimation technology provides a real time means of
assessing mental workload. Such technology can effectively enhance the
performance of the human-machine interaction and the learning process. When
designing workload estimation algorithms, a crucial signal processing component
is the feature extraction step. Despite several studies on this field, the
spatial properties of the EEG signals were mostly neglected. Since EEG
inherently has a poor spacial resolution, features extracted individually from
each EEG channel may not be sufficiently efficient. This problem becomes more
pronounced when we use low-cost but convenient EEG sensors with limited
stability which is the case in practical scenarios. To address this issue, in
this paper, we introduce a filter bank common spatial patterns algorithm
combined with a feature selection method to extract spatio-spectral features
discriminating different mental workload levels. To evaluate the proposed
algorithm, we carry out a comparative analysis between two representative types
of working memory tasks using data recorded from an Emotiv EPOC headset which
is a mobile low-cost EEG recording device. The experimental results showed that
the proposed spatial filtering algorithm outperformed the state-of-the
algorithms in terms of the classification accuracy."
"The quality of high-end videoconferencing systems has improved significantly
over the last few years enabling a class of applications known as
""telepresence"" wherein the users engaged in a communication session experience
a feeling of mutual presence in a shared virtual space. Telepresence systems
have reached a maturity level that seriously challenges the old familiar truism
that a face-to-face meeting is always better than a technology-mediated
alternative. To explore the state of the art in telepresence technology and
outline future opportunities, this paper proposes an optimality condition,
expressed as a ""Turing Test,"" whereby the subjective experience of using a
telepresence system is compared to the corresponding face-to-face situation.
The requirements and challenges of designing a system passing such a Turing
Test for telepresence are analyzed with respect to the limits of human
perception, and the feasibility of achieving this goal with currently available
or near future technology is discussed."
"Get-Up-and-Go Test is commonly used for assessing the physical mobility of
the elderly by physicians. This paper presents a method for automatic analysis
and classification of human gait in the Get-Up-and-Go Test using a Microsoft
Kinect sensor. Two types of features are automatically extracted from the human
skeleton data provided by the Kinect sensor. The first type of feature is
related to the human gait (e.g., number of steps, step duration, and turning
duration); whereas the other one describes the anatomical configuration (e.g.,
knee angles, leg angle, and distance between elbows). These features
characterize the degree of human physical mobility. State-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms (i.e. Bag of Words and Support Vector Machines) are used to
classify the severity of gaits in 12 subjects with ages ranging between 65 and
90 enrolled in a pilot study. Our experimental results show that these features
can discriminate between patients who have a high risk for falling and patients
with a lower fall risk."
"My research aims to design systems for complex sensemaking by remotely
located non-expert collaborators (crowds), to solve computationally hard
problems like crimes."
"Crime solving is a domain where solution discovery is often serendipitous.
Unstructured mechanisms, like Reddit, for crime solving through crowds have
failed so far. Mechanisms, collaborations, workflows, and micro-tasks necessary
for successful crime solving might also vary across different crimes.
Cognitively, while experts might have deeper domain knowledge, they might also
fall prey to biased analysis. Non-experts, while lacking formal training, might
instead offer non-conventional perspectives requiring direction. The analytical
process is itself an iterative process of foraging and sensemaking. Users would
explore to broaden solution space and narrow down to a solution iteratively
until identifying the global maxima instead of local maxima. In this proposal,
my research aims to design systems for enabling complex sensemaking tasks that
require collaboration between remotely located non-expert crowds with expert
crowds to compensate for their cognitive challenges and lack of training. This
would require better understanding of the structure, workflow, and micro-tasks
necessary for successful collaborations. This proposal builds upon previous
work on collaborative sensemaking between remote partners in lab experiments
and endeavors to scale it across multiple team members, with varying expertise
levels."
"We propose a toolkit for creating Tangible Out-of-Body Experiences: exposing
the inner states of users using physiological signals such as heart rate or
brain activity. Tobe can take the form of a tangible avatar displaying live
physiological readings to reflect on ourselves and others. Such a toolkit could
be used by researchers and designers to create a multitude of potential
tangible applications, including (but not limited to) educational tools about
Science Technologies Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and cognitive science,
medical applications or entertainment and social experiences with one or
several users or Tobes involved. Through a co-design approach, we investigated
how everyday people picture their physiology and we validated the acceptability
of Tobe in a scientific museum. We also give a practical example where two
users relax together, with insights on how Tobe helped them to synchronize
their signals and share a moment."
"Even though there are sophisticated AI planning algorithms, many integrated,
large-scale projects do not use planning. One reason seems to be the missing
support by engineering tools such as syntax highlighting and visualization. We
propose myPDDL - a modular toolbox for efficiently creating PDDL domains and
problems. To evaluate myPDDL, we compare it to existing knowledge engineering
tools for PDDL and experimentally assess its usefulness for novice PDDL users."
"Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the use of open source projects by
common novice users; Open Source Software (OSS) is thus no longer a reserved
arena for software developers and computer gurus. Although user-centered
designs are gaining popularity in OSS, usability is still not considered as one
of the prime objectives in many design scenarios. In this paper, we analyze
industry users perception of usability factors, including understandability,
learnability, operability and attractiveness, on OSS usability. The research
model of this empirical study establishes the relationship between the key
usability factors and OSS usability from industrial perspective. In order to
conduct the study, a data set of 105 industry users is included. The results of
the empirical investigation indicate the significance of the key factors for
OSS usability."
"Visually impaired people face important challenges related to orientation and
mobility. Indeed, 56% of visually impaired people in France declared having
problems concerning autonomous mobility. These problems often mean that
visually impaired people travel less, which influences their personal and
professional life and can lead to exclusion from society. Therefore this issue
presents a social challenge as well as an important research area. Accessible
geographic maps are helpful for acquiring knowledge about a city's or
neighborhood's configuration, as well as selecting a route to reach a
destination. Traditionally, raised-line paper maps with braille text have been
used. These maps have proved to be efficient for the acquisition of spatial
knowledge by visually impaired people. Yet, these maps possess significant
limitations. For instance, due to the specificities of the tactile sense only a
limited amount of information can be displayed on a single map, which
dramatically increases the number of maps that are needed. For the same reason,
it is difficult to represent specific information such as distances. Finally,
braille labels are used for textual descriptions but only a small percentage of
the visually impaired population reads braille. In France 15% of blind people
are braille readers and only 10% can read and write. In the United States,
fewer than 10% of the legally blind people are braille readers and only 10% of
blind children actually learn braille. Recent technological advances have
enabled the design of interactive maps with the aim to overcome these
limitations. Indeed, interactive maps have the potential to provide a broad
spectrum of the population with spatial knowledge, irrespective of age,
impairment, skill level, or other factors. To this regard, they might be an
efficient means for providing visually impaired people with access to
geospatial information. In this paper we give an overview of our research on
making geographic maps accessible to visually impaired people."
"Moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity has an established
preventative role in obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. However
recent evidence suggests that sitting time affects health negatively
independent of whether adults meet prescribed physical activity guidelines.
Since many of us spend long hours daily sitting in front of a host of
electronic screens, this is cause for concern. In this paper, we describe a set
of three prototype digital games created for encouraging light-intensity
physical activity during short breaks at work. The design of these kinds of
games is a complex process that must consider motivation strategies,
interaction methodology, usability and ludic aspects. We present design
guidelines for technologies that encourage physical activity in the workplace
that we derived from a user evaluation using the prototypes. Although the
design guidelines can be seen as general principles, we conclude that they have
to be considered differently for different workplace cultures and workspaces.
Our study was conducted with users who have some experience playing casual
games on their mobile devices and were able and willing to increase their
physical activity."
"MetaSpace II (MS2) is a social Virtual Reality (VR) system where multiple
users can not only see and hear but also interact with each other, grasp and
manipulate objects, walk around in space, and get tactile feedback. MS2 allows
walking in physical space by tracking each user's skeleton in real-time and
allows users to feel by employing passive haptics i.e., when users touch or
manipulate an object in the virtual world, they simultaneously also touch or
manipulate a corresponding object in the physical world. To enable these
elements in VR, MS2 creates a correspondence in spatial layout and object
placement by building the virtual world on top of a 3D scan of the real world.
Through the association between the real and virtual world, users are able to
walk freely while wearing a head-mounted device, avoid obstacles like walls and
furniture, and interact with people and objects. Most current virtual reality
(VR) environments are designed for a single user experience where interactions
with virtual objects are mediated by hand-held input devices or hand gestures.
Additionally, users are only shown a representation of their hands in VR
floating in front of the camera as seen from a first person perspective. We
believe, representing each user as a full-body avatar that is controlled by
natural movements of the person in the real world (see Figure 1d), can greatly
enhance believability and a user's sense immersion in VR."
"This paper presents a telepresence interaction framework based on touchscreen
and telepresence-robot technologies. The core of the framework is a new user
interface, Touchable live video Image based User Interface, called TIUI. The
TIUI allows a remote operator to not just drive the telepresence robot but
operate and interact with real objects by touching their live video images on a
pad with finger touch gestures. We implemented a telepresence interaction
system which is composed of a telepresence robot and tele-interactive objects
located in a local space, the TIUI of a pad located in a remote space, and the
wireless networks connecting the two spaces. Our system can be a perfect
embodiment of a remote operator to do most of daily living tasks, such as
opening a door, drawing a curtain, pushing a wheelchair, and other like tasks.
The evaluation and demonstration results show the effectiveness and promising
applications of our system."
"In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have gained
considerable commercial traction, with Facebook acquiring Oculus VR for \$2
billion, Magic Leap attracting more than \$500 million of funding, and
Microsoft announcing their HoloLens head-worn computer. Where is humanity
headed: a brave new dystopia-or a paradise come true?
  In this article, we present discussions, which started at the symposium
""Making Augmented Reality Real"", held at Nara Institute of Science and
Technology in August 2014. Ten scientists were invited to this three-day event,
which started with a full day of public presentations and panel discussions
(video recordings are available at the event web page), followed by two days of
roundtable discussions addressing the future of AR and VR."
"Effective human-machine collaboration can significantly improve many learning
and planning strategies for information gathering via fusion of 'hard' and
'soft' data originating from machine and human sensors, respectively. However,
gathering the most informative data from human sensors without task overloading
remains a critical technical challenge. In this context, Value of Information
(VOI) is a crucial decision-theoretic metric for scheduling interaction with
human sensors. We present a new Deep Learning based VOI estimation framework
that can be used to schedule collaborative human-machine sensing with
computationally efficient online inference and minimal policy hand-tuning.
Supervised learning is used to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to extract hierarchical features from 'images' of belief spaces obtained via
data fusion. These features can be associated with soft data query choices to
reliably compute VOI for human interaction. The CNN framework is described in
detail, and a performance comparison to a feature-based POMDP scheduling policy
is provided. The practical feasibility of our method is also demonstrated on a
mobile robotic search problem with language-based semantic human sensor inputs."
"In micro-blogging platforms, people connect and interact with others.
However, due to cognitive biases, they tend to interact with like-minded people
and read agreeable information only. Many efforts to make people connect with
those who think differently have not worked well. In this paper, we
hypothesize, first, that previous approaches have not worked because they have
been direct -- they have tried to explicitly connect people with those having
opposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or
presentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral
change. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a
visualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends
politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and
displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's
personal content. We performed an ""in the wild"" evaluation of this platform,
and found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased
algorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the
mixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed
politically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the
recommended profiles. Finally, our results contribute insights in two aspects:
first, which individual differences are important when designing platforms
aimed at behavioral change; and second, which algorithms and user interfaces
should be mixed to help users avoid cognitive mechanisms that lead to biased
behavior."
"With a number of cheap commercial dry EEG kits available today, it is
possible to look at user attention driven scenarios for interaction with the
web browser. Using EEG to determine the user's attention level is preferable to
using methods such as gaze tracking or time spent on the webpage. In this paper
we use the attention level in three different ways. First, as a control
mechanism, to control user interface elements such as menus or buttons. Second,
to make the web browser responsive to the current attention level. Third, as a
means for the web developer to control the user experience based on the level
of attention paid by the user, thus creating attention sensitive websites. We
present implementation details for each of these, using the NeuroSky MindWave
sensor. We also explore issues in the system, and possibility of an EEG based
web standard."
"Urgency of application and development of cognitive graphic tools for usage
in intelligent systems of data analysis, decision making and its justifications
is given. Cognitive graphic tool ""2-simplex prism"" and examples of its usage
are presented. Specificity of program realization of cognitive graphics tools
invariant to problem areas is described. Most significant results are given and
discussed. Future investigations are connected with usage of new approach to
rendering, cross-platform realization, cognitive features improving and
expanding of n-simplex family."
"This paper proposes the concept of ""live-action virtual reality games"" as a
new genre of digital games based on an innovative combination of live-action,
mixed-reality, context-awareness, and interaction paradigms that comprise
tangible objects, context-aware input devices, and embedded/embodied
interactions. Live-action virtual reality games are ""live-action games"" because
a player physically acts out (using his/her real body and senses) his/her
""avatar"" (his/her virtual representation) in the game stage, which is the
mixed-reality environment where the game happens. The game stage is a kind of
""augmented virtuality""; a mixed-reality where the virtual world is augmented
with real-world information. In live-action virtual reality games, players wear
HMD devices and see a virtual world that is constructed using the physical
world architecture as the basic geometry and context information. Physical
objects that reside in the physical world are also mapped to virtual elements.
Live-action virtual reality games keeps the virtual and real-worlds
superimposed, requiring players to physically move in the environment and to
use different interaction paradigms (such as tangible and embodied interaction)
to complete game activities. This setup enables the players to touch physical
architectural elements (such as walls) and other objects, ""feeling"" the game
stage. Players have free movement and may interact with physical objects placed
in the game stage, implicitly and explicitly. Live-action virtual reality games
differ from similar game concepts because they sense and use contextual
information to create unpredictable game experiences, giving rise to emergent
gameplay."
"The aim of this thesis was the design and development of an interactive
system enhancing collaborative sensemaking. The system design was based on
related work research and preliminary user study. The system is based on
multiple spatially-aware mobile devices. The spatial awareness is established
with a motion tracking system. The information about position of tablets is
received by a server. The server communicates with the devices and manages the
content of each device. The implemented system supports managing the elements
of information across the devices basing on their relative spatial arrangement.
The evaluation of the system was done by a user study."
"This paper proposes the usage of \emph{visualisation widgets} for exploratory
search with \emph{sentiment} as a facet. Starting from specific design goals
for depiction of ambivalence in sentiment, two visualization widgets were
implemented: \emph{scatter plot} and \emph{parallel coordinates}. Those widgets
were evaluated against a text baseline in a small-scale usability study with
exploratory tasks using Wikipedia as dataset. The study results indicate that
users spend more time browsing with scatter plots in a positive way. A post-hoc
analysis of individual differences in behavior revealed that when considering
two types of users, \emph{explorers} and \emph{achievers}, engagement with
scatter plots is positive and significantly greater \textit{when users are
explorers}. We discuss the implications of these findings for sentiment-based
exploratory search and personalised user interfaces."
"Measuring brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG) is mature enough
to assess mental states. Combined with existing methods, such tool can be used
to strengthen the understanding of user experience. We contribute a set of
methods to estimate continuously the user's mental workload, attention and
recognition of interaction errors during different interaction tasks. We
validate these measures on a controlled virtual environment and show how they
can be used to compare different interaction techniques or devices, by
comparing here a keyboard and a touch-based interface. Thanks to such a
framework, EEG becomes a promising method to improve the overall usability of
complex computer systems."
"Pointing devices that reside on the keyboard can reduce the overall time
needed to perform mixed pointing and typing tasks, since the hand of the user
does not have to reach for the pointing device. However, previous
implementations of this kind of device have a higher movement time compared to
the mouse and trackpad due to large error rate, low speed and spatial
resolution. In this paper we introduce Keyboard Surface Interaction (KSI), an
interaction approach that turns the surface of a keyboard into an interaction
surface and allows users to rest their hands on the keyboard at all times to
minimize fatigue. We developed a proof-of-concept implementation, Fingers,
which we optimized over a series of studies. Finally, we evaluated Fingers
against the mouse and trackpad in a user study with 25 participants on a Fitts
law test style, mixed typing and pointing task. Results showed that for users
with more exposure to KSI, our KSI device had better performance (reduced
movement and homing time) and reduced discomfort compared to the trackpad. When
compared to the mouse, KSI had reduced homing time and reduced discomfort, but
increased movement time. This interaction approach is not only a new way to
capitalize on the space on top of the keyboard, but also a call to innovate and
think beyond the touchscreen, touchpad, and mouse as our main pointing devices.
The results of our studies serve as a specification for future KSI devices."
"Alphanumeric authentication routinely fails to regulate access to resources
with the required stringency, primarily due to usability issues. Initial
deployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws
only emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a
replacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into
knowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry.
Alternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that
alternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the
results from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their
viability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically
where the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is
that the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially
targeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of
contexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another.
Consequently, the contribution of this paper is an ""in the wild"" evaluation of
an alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its
lab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to
regulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed.
The performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by
reflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication
mechanisms."
"Buses are the primary means of public transportation in the city of Rio de
Janeiro, carrying around 100 million passengers every month. Recently,
real-time GPS coordinates of all operating public buses has been made publicly
available - roughly 1 million GPS entries each captured each day. In an initial
study, we observed that a substantial number of buses follow trajectories that
do not follow the expected behavior. In this paper, we present RioBusData, a
tool that helps users identify and explore, through different visualizations,
the behavior of outlier trajectories. We describe how the system automatically
detects these outliers using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and we also
discuss a series of case studies which show how RioBusData helps users better
understand not only the flow and service of outlier buses but also the bus
system as a whole."
"Forgetting is in common in daily life, and 50-80% everyday's forgetting is
due to prospective memory failures, which have significant impacts on our life.
More seriously, some of these memory lapses can bring fatal consequences such
as forgetting a sleeping infant in the back seat of a car. People tend to use
various techniques to improve their prospective memory performance. Setting up
a reminder is one of the most important techniques. The existing studies
provide evidences in support of using reminders to cope with prospective memory
failures. However, people are not satisfied with existing reminders because of
their limitations in different aspects including reliability, optimization, and
adaption.
  Through analysing the functions and features of existing reminder systems,
this book draft summarizes their advantages and limitations. We are motivated
to improve the performance of reminder systems. For the improvements, the
relevant theories and mechanisms of prospective memory from psychology must be
complied with, incorporated, and applied in this new study.
  Based on the literature review, a new reminder model is proposed, which
includes a novel reminder planer, a prospective memory based agent, and a
personalized user model. The reminder planer is responsible for determining the
optimal reminder plan (including the optimal number of reminders, the optimal
reminding schedule and the optimal reminding way). The prospective memory agent
is responsible for executing the reminding processes. The personalized user
model is proposed to learn from users' behaviors and preferences based on
human-system interactions and is responsible for adapting the reminder plan to
meet users' preferences as much as possible."
"Dwelling is an essential task to be performed to select keys from an
on-screen keyboard present in the eye typing interface. This selection task can
be performed by fixing eye gaze on a key for a prolonged time. Spending
sufficient amount of time on each key effectively decreases the overall eye
typing rate. To address the problem, researchers proposed mechanisms, which
diminish the dwell time. We conducted a within-subject usability evaluation of
four dwell-free eye typing techniques. The results of first-time usability
study, longitudinal study and subjective evaluation conducted with 15
participants confirm the superiority of controlled eye movement based advanced
eye typing method (Adv-EyeK) than the other three techniques."
"The elderly often struggle when interacting with technologies. This is
because the software and hardware components of the technologies are not
familiar to the elderly's mental model. This is a lack of empirical studies
about how the concept of familiarity can be infused into the design of
interactive technology systems to bridge the digital divide preventing today's
elderly people from actively engaging with such technologies. In this paper, a
multi pronged approach is utilized. We investigate the Effects of Familiarity
in Design on the Adoption of Wellness Games by the Elderly, familiarity in
productive ageing, familiarity in efficient collaborative crowdsourcing,
productive ageing through familiarity based Intelligent Personalized
Crowdsourcing and familiarity based Agent Augmented Inter-generational
Crowdsourcing. The results show that familiarity in design improves the
perceived satisfaction and adoption likelihood significantly among the elderly
users. These results can potentially benefit intelligent interface agent design
when such agents need to interact with elderly users. A Crowdsourcing
algorithm, CrowdAsm is developed. By using CrowdAsm we are able to dynamically
assemble teams of workers considering the budgets, the availability of workers
with the required skills and their track records to complete crowdsourcing
tasks requiring collaboration among workers with heterogeneous skills.
Theoretical analysis has shown that CrowdAsm can achieve close to optimal
profit for a collaborative crowdsourcing system if workers follow the
recommendations."
"A carefully constructed scatterplot can reveal plenty about an underlying
data set. However, in most cases visually mining and understanding a large
multivariate data set requires more finesse, and greater level of interactivity
to really grasp the full spectrum of the information being presented. We
present a paradigm for glyph design and use in the creation of single plots
presenting multiple variables of information. We center our design on two key
concepts. The first concept is that visually it is easier to discriminate
between completely distinct shapes rather than subtly different ones, specially
when partially occluded. The second one is that users ingest information in
layers, i.e. in an order of visual relevance. Using this paradigm, we present
complex data as binned into desired and relevant discrete categories. We show
results in the areas of high energy physics and security, displaying over 6
distinct data variables in each single plot, yielding a clear, highly readable,
and effective visualization."
"We propose, in this paper, a model of continuous use of corporate
collaborative KMS. Companies do not always have the guaranty that their KMS
will be continuously used. This statement can constitute an important obstacle
for knowledge management processes. Our work is based on the analysis of
classical models for initial and continuous use of technologies. We also
analyse the regulation concept and explain how it is valuable to support a
continuous use of KMS. We observed that awareness may be a regulation means
that allows taking this problem into account. Awareness is a concept, which has
been profusely used to improve user experience in collaborative environments.
It is an important element for regulation of activity. In our model, we assume
that one can integrate awareness in information systems to positively influence
beliefs about them. The final objective of our work is to refine some concepts
to fit the particularities of collaborative KMS and to propose an awareness
regulation process using the traces of the users' interactions with the
systems."
"The work presented in this paper focuses on the improvement of corporate
knowledge management systems. For the implementation of such systems, companies
deploy can important means for small gains. Indeed, management services often
notice very limited use compared to what they actually expect. We present a
five-step redesigning approach which takes into account different factors to
increase the use of these systems. We use as an example the knowledge sharing
platform implemented for the employees of Soci{\'e}t{\'e} du Canal de Provence
(SCP). This system was taken into production but very occasionally used. We
describe the reasons for this limited use and we propose a design methodology
adapted to the context. Promoting the effective use of the system, our approach
has been experimented and evaluated with a panel of users working at SCP."
"This article proposes the analysis on novel human computer interaction (HCI)
platform based college mathematical education methodology. Above for the
application of virtual reality technology in teaching the problems in the
study, only through the organization focus on the professional and technical
personnel, and constantly improve researchers in development process of
professional knowledge, close to the actual needs of the teaching can we
achieve the satisfactory result. To obtain better education output, we combine
the Kinect to form the HCI based teaching environment. We firstly review the
latest HCI technique and principles of college math courses, then we introduce
basic components of the Kinect including the gesture segmentation, systematic
implementation and the primary characteristics of the platform. As the further
step, we implement the system with the re-write of script code to build up the
personalized HCI assisted education scenario. The verification and simulation
proves the feasibility of our method."
"In mixed reality, real objects can be used to interact with virtual objects.
However, unlike in the real world, real objects do not encounter any opposite
reaction force when pushing against virtual objects. The lack of reaction force
during manipulation prevents users from perceiving the mass of virtual objects.
Although this could be addressed by equipping real objects with force-feedback
devices, such a solution remains complex and impractical.In this work, we
present a technique to produce an illusion of mass without any active
force-feedback mechanism. This is achieved by simulating the effects of this
reaction force in a purely visual way. A first study demonstrates that our
technique indeed allows users to differentiate light virtual objects from heavy
virtual objects. In addition, it shows that the illusion is immediately
effective, with no prior training. In a second study, we measure the lowest
mass difference (JND) that can be perceived with this technique. The
effectiveness and ease of implementation of our solution provides an
opportunity to enhance mixed reality interaction at no additional cost."
"In the complex manufacturing sector a considerable amount of resources are
focused on developing new skills and training workers. In that context,
increasing the effectiveness of those processes and reducing the investment
required is an outstanding issue. In this paper we present an experiment that
shows how modern Human Computer Interaction (HCI) metaphors such as
collaborative mixed-reality can be used to transmit procedural knowledge and
could eventually replace other forms of face-to-face training. We implement a
real-time Immersive Augmented Reality (IAR) setup with see-through cameras that
allows for collaborative interactions that can simulate conventional forms of
training. The obtained results indicate that people who took the IAR training
achieved the same performance than people in the conventional face-to-face
training condition. These results, their implications for future training and
the use of HCI paradigms in this context are discussed in this paper."
"Pluridisciplinar convergence is a major problem that had emerged with
Human-Artefact Systems and so-called "" Augmented Humanity "" as academical
fields and even more as technical fields. Problems come mainly from the
juxtaposition of two very different types of system, a biological one and an
artificial one. Thus, conceiving and designing the multiple couplings between
them has become a major difficulty. Some came with reductionnist solutions to
answer these problems but since we know that a biological system and a
technical system are different, this approach is limited from its beginning.
Using a specifically designed questionnaire and statistical analysis we
determined how specialists (medical practitioners, ergonomists and engineers)
in the domain conceive themselves what is a Human-Artifact System and how they
relate to existent traditions and showed that some of them relate to the
integrativist views."
"Within the last decade, running has become one of the most popular physical
activities in the world. Although the benefits of running are numerous, there
is a risk of Running Related Injuries (RRI) of the lower extremities.
Electromyography (EMG) techniques have previously been used to study causes of
RRIs, but the complexity of this technology limits its use to a laboratory
setting. As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology
acts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study
presents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of
jogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of
recording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the
device, a proof of concept study consisting of $N=2$ runners performing a set
of $5km$ running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on
muscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that
muscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable
device, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the
likelihood of suffering from RRIs."
"In this paper, we focus on an emerging strand of IT-oriented research, namely
Human-Data Interaction (HDI) and how this can be applied to healthcare. HDI
regards both how humans create and use data by means of interactive systems,
which can both assist and constrain them, as well as to passively collect and
proactively generate data. Healthcare provides a challenging arena to test the
potential of HDI to provide a new, user-centered perspective on how data work
should be supported and assessed, especially in the light of the fact that data
are becoming increasingly big and that many tools are now available for the lay
people, including doctors and nurses, to interact with health-related data."
"Expert crowdsourcing marketplaces have untapped potential to empower workers'
career and skill development. Currently, many workers cannot afford to invest
the time and sacrifice the earnings required to learn a new skill, and a lack
of experience makes it difficult to get job offers even if they do. In this
paper, we seek to lower the threshold to skill development by repurposing
existing tasks on the marketplace as mentored, paid, real-world work
experiences, which we refer to as micro-internships. We instantiate this idea
in Atelier, a micro-internship platform that connects crowd interns with crowd
mentors. Atelier guides mentor-intern pairs to break down expert crowdsourcing
tasks into milestones, review intermediate output, and problem-solve together.
We conducted a field experiment comparing Atelier's mentorship model to a
non-mentored alternative on a real-world programming crowdsourcing task,
finding that Atelier helped interns maintain forward progress and absorb best
practices."
"This article investigates graph analysis for intelligent marketing in smart
cities, where metatrails are crowdsourced by mobile sensing for marketing
strategies. Unlike most works that focused on client sides, this study is
intended for market planning, from the perspective of enterprises. Several
novel crowdsourced features based on metatrails, including hotspot networks,
crowd transitions, affinity subnetworks, and sequential visiting patterns, are
discussed in the article. These smart footprints can reflect crowd preferences
and the topology of a site of interest. Marketers can utilize such information
for commercial resource planning and deployment. Simulations were conducted to
demonstrate the performance. At the end, this study also discusses different
scenarios for practical geo-conquesting applications."
"While physiological sensors enter the mass market and reach the general
public, they are still mainly employed to monitor health -- whether it is for
medical purpose or sports. We describe an application that uses heart rate
feedback as an incentive for social interactions. A traditional board game has
been ""augmented"" through remote physiological sensing, using webcams.
Projection helped to conceal the technological aspects from users. We detail
how players reacted -- stressful situations could emerge when users are
deprived from their own signals -- and we give directions for game designers to
integrate physiological sensors."
"Team collaboration plays a key role in the success of any multi-user
activity. Software engineering is a highly collaborative activity, where
multiple developers and designers work together to solve a common problem.
Meaningful and effective designer-developer collaboration improves the user
experience, which can improve the chances of success for the project. Learning
to program is another activity that can be implemented in a more collaborative
way, students can learn in an active style by working with others. The growth
of online classes, from small structured seminars to massive open online
courses (MOOCs), and the isolation and impoverished learning experience some
students report in these, points to an urgent need for tools that support
remote pair programming in a distributed educational setting. In this paper, we
describe Jimbo, a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) that
we believe is beneficial and effective in both aforementioned activities. Jimbo
integrates many features that support better collaboration and communication
between designers and developers, to bridge communication gaps and develop
mutual understanding. These novel features can improve today's CS education by
bringing students closer to each other and their instructors as well as
training them to collaborate which is consistent with current practices in
software engineering."
"We describe Hydroprompt, a prototype for sensing and motivating healthy water
intake in work environments. In a 3-week field deployment of Hydroprompt, we
evaluate the effectiveness of three approaches to behavior change: historical
information enabling users to compare their water intake lev- els across
different times of day and days of week, implicit feedback providing subtle
cues to users on the current hydration levels, and explicit prompting at-
tempting to remind participants when hydration falls below acceptable levels or
when substantial amount of time has elapsed since the last sip."
"The behavior change process is a dynamic journey with different informational
and motivational needs across its different stages; yet current technologies
for behavior change are static. In our recent deployment of Habito, an activity
tracking mobile app, we found individuals ""readiness"" to behavior change (or
the stage of behavior change they were in) to be a strong predictor of
adoption. Individuals in the contemplation and preparation stages had an
adoption rate of 56%, whereas individuals in precontemplation, action or
maintenance stages had an adoption rate of only 20%. In this position paper we
argue for behavior change technologies that are tailored to the different
stages of behavior change."
"We present a new approach to achieve tangible object manipulation with a
single, fully portable and self-contained device. Our solution is based on the
concept of a ""tangible volume"". We turn a tangible object into a handheld
fish-tank display. The tangible volume represents a volume of space that can be
freely manipulated within a virtual scene. This volume can be positioned onto
virtual objects to directly grasp them, and to manipulate them in 3D space. We
investigate this concept through two user studies. The first study evaluates
the intuitiveness of using a tangible volume for grasping and manipulating
virtual objects. The second study evaluates the effects of the limited field of
view on spatial awareness. Finally, we present a generalization of this concept
to other forms of interaction through the surface of the volume."
"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) provide the opportunity to control external
devices using the brain ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals. In this paper we
propose two software framework in order to control a 5 degree of freedom
robotic and prosthetic hand. Results are presented where an Emotiv Cognitive
Suite (i.e. the 1st framework) combined with an embedded software system (i.e.
an open source Arduino board) is able to control the hand through character
input associated with the taught actions of the suite. This system provides
evidence of the feasibility of brain signals being a viable approach to
controlling the chosen prosthetic. Results are then presented in the second
framework. This latter one allowed for the training and classification of EEG
signals for motor imagery tasks. When analysing the system, clear visual
representations of the performance and accuracy are presented in the results
using a confusion matrix, accuracy measurement and a feedback bar signifying
signal strength. Experiments with various acquisition datasets were carried out
and with a critical evaluation of the results given. Finally depending on the
classification of the brain signal a Python script outputs the driving command
to the Arduino to control the prosthetic. The proposed architecture performs
overall good results for the design and implementation of economically
convenient BCI and prosthesis."
"Digital devices are now ubiquitous and have the potential to be used to
support positive changes in human lives and promote psychological well-being.
This paper presents three interactive systems that we created focusing on
introspection activities, leveraging tangible interaction and spatial augmented
reality. More specifically, we describe anthropomorphic augmented avatars that
display the users' inner states using physiological sensors. We also present a
first prototype of an augmented sandbox specifically dedicated to promoting
mindfulness activities."
"Analyzing high-dimensional data and finding hidden patterns is a difficult
problem and has attracted numerous research efforts. Automated methods can be
useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via
interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An
inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to
truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this
limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data
space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore
these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface, but using
additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded
space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from
combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and
navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A
subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, and also
helps them navigate within and across any higher-dimensional subspaces
identified by clustering. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a
word cloud of attribute labels, sized according to the relevance of the
associated data dimensions in the currently selected subspace. Finally, a view
gallery helps users keep their bearings and return to interesting subspaces and
views. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of
application areas, such as cluster analysis and refinement, information
discovery, and supervised training of classifiers."
"Collaborative sensemaking requires that analysts share their information and
insights with each other, but this process of sharing runs the risks of
prematurely focusing the investigation on specific suspects. To address this
tension, we propose and test an interface for collaborative crime analysis that
aims to make analysts more aware of their sensemaking processes. We compare our
sensemaking translucence interface to a standard interface without special
sensemaking features in a controlled laboratory study. We found that the
sensemaking translucence interface significantly improved clue finding and
crime solving performance, but that analysts rated the interface lower on
subjective measures than the standard interface. We conclude that designing for
distributed sensemaking requires balancing task performance vs. user experience
and real-time information sharing vs. data accuracy."
"Medium-sized touch displays, sized 30 to 50 inches, are becoming more
affordable and more widely available. Prolonged use of such displays can result
in arm fatigue or skin irritation, especially when multiple long distance drags
are involved. To address this issue, we present TapDrag, an alternative
dragging technique that complements traditional dragging with a simple tapping
gesture on both ends of the intended dragging path. Our experimental evaluation
suggests that TapDrag is a viable alternative to traditional dragging with
faster task completion times for long distances. Qualitative user feedback
indicates that TapDrag helps prevent skin irritation. A reduction in arm
fatigue remains unconfirmed."
"This paper investigates the performance of Deep Learning for speech emotion
classification when the speech is compounded with noise. It reports on the
classification accuracy and concludes with the future directions for achieving
greater robustness for emotion recognition from noisy speech."
"This is the preprint version of our paper on JOMS. In this paper, two mHealth
applications are introduced, which can be employed as the terminals of bigdata
based health service to collect information for electronic medical records
(EMRs). The first one is a hybrid system for improving the user experience in
the hyperbaric oxygen chamber by 3D stereoscopic virtual reality glasses and
immersive perception. Several HMDs have been tested and compared. The second
application is a voice interactive serious game as a likely solution for
providing assistive rehabilitation tool for therapists. The recorder of the
voice of patients could be analysed to evaluate the long-time rehabilitation
results and further to predict the rehabilitation process."
"In this paper, we propose a real-time adaptive prediction method to calculate
smooth and accurate haptic feedback in complex scenarios. Smooth haptic
feedback is an important task for haptic rendering with complex virtual
objects. However, commonly the update rate of the haptic rendering may drop
down during multi-point contact in complex scenarios because high computational
cost is required for collision detection and physically-based dynamic
simulation. If the haptic rendering is done at a lower update rate, it may
cause discontinuous or instable force/torque feedback. Therefore, to implement
smooth and accurate haptic rendering, the update rate of force/torque
calculation should be kept in a high and constant frequency. In the proposed
method, the auto-regressive model with real-time coefficients update is
proposed to predict interactive forces/torques during the physical simulation.
In addition, we introduce a spline function to dynamically interpolate smooth
forces/torques in haptic display according to the update rate of physical
simulation. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of the proposed method
and compare its performance with other methods and algorithms. The result shows
that the proposed method can provide smooth and accurate haptic force feedback
at a high update rate for complex scenarios."
"We present the first in a series of three academic essays which deal with the
question of how to build a generalized player model. We begin with a
proposition: a general model of players requires parameters for the subjective
experience of play, including at least: player psychology, game structure, and
actions of play. Based on this proposition, we pose three linked research
questions, which make incomplete progress toward a generalised player model:
RQ1 what is a necessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?;
RQ2 can such a foundation improve performance of a computational
intelligence-based player model?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve
efficacy of adaptive artificial intelligence in games? We set out the arguments
behind these research questions in each of the three essays, presented as three
preprints. The first essay, in this preprint, reviews the literature for the
core foundations for a general player model. We then propose a plan for future
work to systematically extend the review and thus provide an empirical answer
to RQ1 above. This work will directly support the proposed approach to address
RQ2 and RQ3 above. This review was developed to support our 'Behavlets'
approach to player modelling; therefore if citing this work, please use the
relevant citation: Cowley B, Charles D. Behavlets: a Method for Practical
Player Modelling using Psychology-Based Player Traits and Domain Specific

"We examine a class of techniques for 3D object manipulation on mobile
devices, in which the device's physical motion is applied to 3D objects
displayed on the device itself. This ""local coupling"" between input and display
creates specific challenges compared to manipulation techniques designed for
monitor-based or immersive virtual environments. Our work focuses specifically
on the mapping between device motion and object motion. We review existing
manipulation techniques and introduce a formal description of the main mappings
under a common notation. Based on this notation, we analyze these mappings and
their properties in order to answer crucial usability questions. We first
investigate how the 3D objects should move on the screen, since the screen also
moves with the mobile device during manipulation. We then investigate the
effects of a limited range of manipulation and present a number of solutions to
overcome this constraint. This work provides a theoretical framework to better
understand the properties of locally-coupled 3D manipulation mappings based on
mobile device motion."
"As interactive devices become pervasive, people are beginning to looking for
more advanced interaction with televisions in the living room. Interactive
television has the potential to offer a very engaging experience. But most
common user tasks are still challenging with such systems, such as menu
selection or text input. And little work has been done on understanding and
sup-porting the effective design of freehand interaction with an TV in the
living room. In this paper, we perform two studies investi-gating freehand
gestural interaction with a consumer level sensor, which is suitable for TV
scenarios. In the first study, we inves-tigate a range of design factors for
tiled layout menu selection, including wearable feedback, push gesture depth,
target size and position in motor space. The results show that tactile and
audio feedback have no significant effect on performance and prefer-ence, and
these results inform potential designs for high selection performance. In the
second study, we investigate a common TV user task of text input using freehand
gesture. We design and evaluate two virtual keyboard layouts and three freehand
selec-tion methods. Results show that ease of use and error tolerance can be
both achieved using a text entry method utilizing a dual circle layout and an
expanding target selection technique. Finally, we propose design guidelines for
effective, usable and com-fortable freehand gestural interaction for
interactive TV based on the findings."
"Video watching had emerged as one of the most frequent media activities on
the Internet. Yet, little is known about how users watch online video. Using
two distinct YouTube datasets, a set of random YouTube videos crawled from the
Web and a set of videos watched by participants tracked by a Chrome extension,
we examine whether and how indicators of collective preferences and reactions
are associated with view duration of videos. We show that video view duration
is positively associated with the video's view count, the number of likes per
view, and the negative sentiment in the comments. These metrics and reactions
have a significant predictive power over the duration the video is watched by
individuals. Our findings provide a more precise understandings of user
engagement with video content in social media beyond view count."
"We evaluate the performance and usability of mouse-based, touch-based, and
tangible interaction for manipulating objects in a 3D virtual environment. This
comparison is a step toward a better understanding of the limitations and
benefits of these existing interaction techniques, with the ultimate goal of
facilitating the integration of different 3D data exploration environments into
a single interaction continuum. For this purpose we analyze participants'
performance in 3D manipulation using a docking task. We measured completion
times, docking precision, as well as subjective criteria such as fatigue,
workload, and preference. Our results show that the three input modalities
provide similar levels of precision but require different interaction times. We
also discuss our qualitative observations as well as people's preferences and
put our findings into context of the practical application domain of 3D data
analysis environments."
"We present the second in a series of three academic essays which deal with
the question of how to build a generalized player model. We begin with a

'Behavlets' method can improve the performance and accuracy of a predictive
player model in the well-known Pac-Man game, by providing a simple foundation
for areas a) to c) above. We then propose a plan for future work to address RQ2
by conclusively testing the Behavlets approach. This plan builds on the work
proposed in the first preprint essay to address RQ1, and in turn provides
support for work on RQ3. The Behavlets approach was described previously;

"Despite current controversy over e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, we
present early work based on a web survey (N=249) that shows that some
e-cigarette users (46.2%) want to quit altogether, and that behavioral feedback
that can be tracked can fulfill that purpose. Based on our survey findings, we
designed VapeTracker, an early prototype that can attach to any e-cigarette
device to track vaping activity. We discuss our future research on vaping
cessation, addressing how to improve our VapeTracker prototype, ambient
feedback mechanisms, and the future inclusion of behavior change models to
support quitting e-cigarettes."
"Interactive visual applications create animations that encode changes in the
data. For example, cross-filtering dynamically updates linked visualizations
based on the user's continuous brushing actions. The animated effects resulting
from these interactions depends both on how interaction (e.g., brushing speed)
controls properties of the animation such as frame rate, as well as how the
data that is being explored dictates the data encoded in the animation. Past
work has found that frame rate matters to general perception, however a
critical question is which of these animation and data properties affects the
perceptual accuracy of judgement tasks, and to what extent. Although graphical
perception has been well studied for static data visualizations, it is ripe for
exploration in the animated setting. We designed two animated judgment tasks of
a target bar in an animated bar chart and empirically evaluate the effects of 2
animations properties - highlighting of the target bar and frame rate - as well
as 3 data properties that affect the target bar's value throughout the
animation. In short, we find that the rate and timing of animation changes is
easier detected in larger values; that encodings such as color are easier to
detect than shapes; and that timing is important - earlier changes were harder
to perceive as compared to later changes in the animation. Our results are an
initial step to understanding perceptual accuracy for animated data
visualizations, both for presentations and ultimately as part of interactive
applications."
"Simulators, as tools that can clearly bring out the effect of impairment, are
invaluable in the design and development process of an assistive device.
Simulators are vital in meeting high standards of accessibility. Described is
our work on a smartphone-based vision simulator for diabetic retinopathy that
is economic, portable, flexible and easy-to-use."
"We present the Pascal animal classes Eye Tracking database. Our database
comprises eye movement recordings compiled from forty users for the bird, cat,
cow, dog, horse and sheep {trainval} sets from the VOC 2012 image set.
Different from recent eye-tracking databases such as
\cite{kiwon_cvpr13_gaze,PapadopoulosCKF14}, a salient aspect of PET is that it
contains eye movements recorded for both the free-viewing and visual search
task conditions. While some differences in terms of overall gaze behavior and
scanning patterns are observed between the two conditions, a very similar
number of fixations are observed on target objects for both conditions. As a
utility application, we show how feature pooling around fixated locations
enables enhanced (animal) object classification accuracy."
"The combination of clinical and personal health and wellbeing data can tell
us much about our behaviors, risks and overall status. The way this data is
visualized may affect our understanding of our own health. To study this
effect, we conducted a small experiment with 30 participants in which we
presented a holistic overview of the health and wellbeing of two modeled
individuals, one of them with metabolic syndrome. We used an insight-based
methodology to assess the effectiveness of the visualizations. The results show
that adequate visualization of holistic health data helps users without medical
background to better understand the overall health situation and possible
health risks related to lifestyles. Furthermore, we found that the application
of insight-based methodology in the health and wellbeing domain remains
unexplored and additional research and methodology development are needed."
"Many different approaches for estimating the Interaction Quality (IQ) of
Spoken Dialogue Systems have been investigated. While dialogues clearly have a
sequential nature, statistical classification approaches designed for
sequential problems do not seem to work better on automatic IQ estimation than
static approaches, i.e., regarding each turn as being independent of the
corresponding dialogue. Hence, we analyse this effect by investigating the
subset of temporal features used as input for statistical classification of IQ.
We extend the set of temporal features to contain the system and the user view.
We determine the contribution of each feature sub-group showing that temporal
features contribute most to the classification performance. Furthermore, for
the feature sub-group modeling the temporal effects with a window, we modify
the window size increasing the overall performance significantly by +15.69%."
"Distant pointing is still not efficient, accurate or flexible enough for many
applications, although many researchers have focused on it. To improve upon
distant pointing, we propose MPP3D, which is especially suitable for
high-resolution displays. MPP3D uses two dimensions of hand positioning to move
a pointer, and it also uses the third dimension to adjust the precision of the
movement. Based on the idea of MPP3D, we propose four techniques which combine
two ways of mapping and two techniques for precision adjustment. We further
provide three types of mapping scheme and visual feedback for each technique.
The potential of the proposed techniques was investigated through
experimentation. The results show that these techniques were competent for
usual computer operations with a cursor, and the adjustment for pointing
precision was beneficial for both pointing efficiency and accuracy."
"The QWERTY effect postulates that the keyboard layout influences word
meanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to
the use of the left hand. For example, previous research has established that
words with more right hand letters are rated more positively than words with
more left hand letters by human subjects in small scale experiments. In this
paper, we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web.
Using data from eleven web platforms related to products, movies, books, and
videos, we conduct observational tests whether a hand-meaning relationship can
be found in decoding text on the web. Furthermore, we investigate whether
encoding text on the web exhibits the QWERTY effect as well, by analyzing the
relationship between the text of online reviews and their star ratings in four
additional datasets. Overall, we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect
both at the point of text interpretation (decoding) and at the point of text
creation (encoding). We also find under which conditions the effect might not
hold. Our findings have implications for any algorithmic method aiming to
evaluate the meaning of words on the web, including for example semantic or
sentiment analysis, and show the existence of ""dactilar onomatopoeias"" that
shape the dynamics of word-meaning associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to reveal the extent to which the QWERTY effect exists
in large scale human-computer interaction on the web."
"Interactive visual analytic systems enable users to discover insights from
complex data. Users can express and test hypotheses via user interaction,
leveraging their domain expertise and prior knowledge to guide and steer the
analytic models in the system. For example, semantic interaction techniques
enable systems to learn from the user's interactions and steer the underlying
analytic models based on the user's analytical reasoning. However, an open
challenge is how to not only steer models based on the dimensions or features
of the data, but how to add dimensions or attributes to the data based on the
domain expertise of the user. In this paper, we present a technique for
inferring and appending dimensions onto the dataset based on the prior
expertise of the user expressed via user interactions. Our technique enables
users to directly manipulate a spatial organization of data, from which both
the dimensions of the data are weighted, and also dimensions created to
represent the prior knowledge the user brings to the system. We describe this
technique and demonstrate its utility via a use case."
"The increasing application of social and human-enabled systems in people's
daily life from one side and from the other side the fast growth of mobile and
smart phones technologies have resulted in generating tremendous amount of
data, also referred to as big data, and a need for analyzing these data, i.e.,
big data analytics. Recently a trend has emerged to incorporate human computing
power into big data analytics to solve some shortcomings of existing big data
analytics such as dealing with semi or unstructured data. Including crowd into
big data analytics creates some new challenges such as security, privacy and
availability issues.
  In this paper study hybrid human-machine big data analytics and propose a
framework to study these systems from crowd involvement point of view. We
identify some open issues in the area and propose a set of research directions
for the future of big data analytics area."
"This paper outlines the development of a wearable game controller
incorporating vibrotacticle haptic feedback that provides a low cost, versatile
and intuitive interface for controlling digital games. The device differs from
many traditional haptic feedback implementation in that it combines
vibrotactile based haptic feedback with gesture based input, thus becoming a
two way conduit between the user and the virtual environment. The device is
intended to challenge what is considered an ""interface"" and draws on work in
the area of Actor-Network theory to purposefully blur the boundary between man
and machine. This allows for a more immersive experience, so rather than making
the user feel like they are controlling an aircraft the intuitive interface
allows the user to become the aircraft that is controlled by the movements of
the user's hand. This device invites playful action and thrill. It bridges new
territory on portable and low cost solutions for haptic controllers in a gaming
context."
"To generate a hypothesis about the effects of anonymity on user participation
in online communities, comments on Youtube were analysed for effects of the
change from allowing pseudonyms to Google+ with its real name policy. Small
differences were detected, leading to the hypothesis that the option to remain
anonymous leads to a less active environment for getting feedback, with less
polite and less rude comments on the expense of neutral ones."
"This paper suggests that recent developments in video game technology have
occurred in parallel to play being moved from public into private spaces, which
has had impact on the way people interact with games. The paper also argues and
that there is potentially value in the creation of public play spaces to create
opportunities to utilise both technology and body for the benefit of community
culture and experiences through gaming. Co-located social gaming coupled with
tangible interfaces offer alternative possibilities for the local video game
scene. This paper includes a descriptive account of Rabble Room Arcade, an
experimental social event combining custom-built tangible interface devices and
multiplayer video games. The event was designed around games that promoted a
return to simplicity through the use of unique tangible controllers to allow
casual gamers to connect to the game and to each other, whilst also
transforming the event into a spectacle."
"In this paper, we describe the development and operating principles of an
immersive virtual reality (VR) visualisation environment that is designed
around the use of consumer VR headsets in an existing wide area motion capture
suite. We present two case studies in the application areas of visualisation of
scientific and engineering data. Each of these case studies utilise a different
render engine, namely a custom engine for one case and a commercial game engine
for the other. The advantages and appropriateness of each approach are
discussed along with suggestions for future work."
"This paper outlines the development of a sensory feedback device providing a
tangible interface for controlling digital environments, in this example a
flight simulator, where the intention for the device is that it is relatively
low cost, versatile and intuitive. Gesture based input allows for a more
immersive experience, so rather than making the user feel like they are
controlling an aircraft the intuitive interface allows the user to become the
aircraft that is controlled by the movements of the user's hand. The movements
are designed to allow a sense of immersion that would be difficult to achieve
with an alternative interface. A vibrotactile based haptic feedback is
incorporated in the device to further enhance the connection between the user
and the game environment by providing immediate confirmation of game events.
When used for navigating an aircraft simulator, this device invites playful
action and thrill. It bridges new territory on portable, low cost solutions for
haptic devices in gaming contexts."
"This paper investigates the player's body as a system capable of unfamiliar
interactive movement achieved through digital mediation in a playful
environment. Body interactions in both digital and non-digital environments can
be considered as a perceptually manipulative exploration of self. This implies
a player may alter how they perceive their body and its operations in order to
create a new playful and original experience. This paper therefore questions
how player interaction can change as their perception of their body changes
using augmentative technology."
"This paper puts forward the perspective that social play spaces are
opportunities to utilise both technology and body for the benefit of community
culture and engagement. Co-located social gaming coupled with tangible
interfaces offer active participant engagement and the development of the local
video game scene. This paper includes a descriptive account of Rabble Room
Arcade, an experimental social event combining custom-built physical interface
devices and multiplayer video games."
"As the quantity of human knowledge increasing rapidly, it is harder and
harder to evaluate a knowledge worker's knowledge quantitatively. There are
lots of demands for evaluating a knowledge worker's knowledge. For example,
accurately finding out a researcher's research concentrations for the last
three years; searching for common topics for two scientists with different
academic backgrounds; helping a researcher discover his deficiencies on a
research field etc. This paper first proposes a method named knowledge model to
evaluate a knowledge worker's knowledge quantitatively without taking an
examination. It records and analyzes an individual's each learning experience,
discovering all the involved knowledge points and calculating their shares by
analyzing the text learning contents with topic model. It calculates a score
for a knowledge point by accumulating the effects of one's all learning
experiences about it. A preliminary knowledge evaluating system is developed to
testify the practicability of knowledge model."
"Recent trend of touch-screen devices produces an accessibility barrier for
visually impaired people. On the other hand, these devices come with sensors
such as accelerometer. This calls for new approaches to human computer
interface (HCI). In this study, our aim is to find an alternative approach to
classify 20 different hand gestures captured by iPhone 3GS's built-in
accelerometer and make high accuracy on user-independent classifications using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with dynamic warping window sizes. 20 gestures with
1,100 gesture data are collected from 15 normal-visioned people. This data set
is used for training. Experiment-1 based on this data set produced an accuracy
rate of 96.7~\%. In order for visually impaired people to use the system, a
gesture recognition based ""talking"" calculator is implemented. In Experiment-2,
4 visually impaired end-users used the calculator and obtained 95.5~\% accuracy
rate among 17 gestures with 720 gesture data totally. Contributions of the
techniques to the end result is also investigated. Dynamic warping window size
is found to be the most effective one. The data and the code is available."
"Existing Real-Time Translation Interfaces (RTTI) do not provide experience as
natural and efficient as monolingual communication. Also, such systems do not
provide functions supporting language learning. This results in the waste of
both time and potential language context. In order to overcome the above
limitations, we propose a solution named ""Talk&Learn"". Its core idea is to
rearrange (""Delay-Match"") the real-time videos and translated texts or
speeches, so as to gain better naturalness and efficiency. At the same time,
this will create extra free time for users. So we further propose to utilize
the free time for contextual language learning."
"This paper outlines the development and evaluation of a wearable haptic game

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease
with early manifestation of motor signs. Objective measurements of motor signs
are of vital importance for diagnosing, monitoring and developing disease
modifying therapies, particularly for the early stages of the disease when
putative neuroprotective treatments could stop neurodegeneration. Current
medical practice has limited tools to routinely monitor PD motor signs with
enough frequency and without undue burden for patients and the healthcare
system. In this paper, we present data indicating that the routine interaction
with computer keyboards can be used to detect motor signs in the early stages
of PD. We explore a solution that measures the key hold times (the time
required to press and release a key) during the normal use of a computer
without any change in hardware and converts it to a PD motor index. This is
achieved by the automatic discovery of patterns in the time series of key hold
times using an ensemble regression algorithm. This new approach discriminated
early PD groups from controls with an AUC = 0.81 (n = 42/43; mean age =
59.0/60.1; women = 43%/60%;PD/controls). The performance was comparable or
better than two other quantitative motor performance tests used clinically:
alternating finger tapping (AUC = 0.75) and single key tapping (AUC = 0.61)."
"The blocks editor, such as the editor in Scratch, is widely applied for
visual programming languages (VPL) nowadays. Despite it's friendly for
non-programmers, it exists three main limitations while displaying block codes:
(1) the readability, (2) the program structure, and (3) the re-use. To cope
with these issues, we introduce a novel formatting tool, block shelves, into
the editor for organizing blocks. A user could utilize shelves to constitute a
user-defined structure for the VPL projects. Based on the experiment results,
block shelves improves the block code navigating and searching significantly.
Besides, for achieving code re-use, users could use shelf export/import to
share/re-use their block codes between projects in the file format of
eXtensible Markup Language (xml.) All functions were demonstrated on MIT App
inventor 2, while all modifications were made in Google Blockly."
"In this paper we present Organic Primitives, an enabling toolbox that expands
upon the library of input-output devices in HCI and facilitates the design of
interactions with organic, fluid-based systems. We formulated color, odor and
shape changing material primitives which act as sensor-actuators that convert
pH signals into human-readable outputs. Food-grade organic molecules
anthocyanin, vanillin, and chitosan were employed as dopants to synthesize
materials which output a spectrum of colors, degrees of shape deformation, and
switch between odorous and non-odorous states. We evaluated the individual
output properties of our sensor-actuators to assess the rate, range, and
reversibility of the changes as a function of pH 2-10. We present a design
space with techniques for enhancing the functionality of the material
primitives, and offer passive and computational methods for controlling the
material interfaces. Finally, we explore applications enabled by Organic
Primitives under four contexts: environmental, cosmetic, edible, and
interspecies."
"Security and usability issues with passwords suggest a need for a new
authentication scheme. Several alternatives involve a physical device or token.
We investigate one such alternative, Pico: an authentication scheme that
utilizes multiple wearable devices. We present the grounded theory results of a
series of semi-structured interviews for exploring perceptions of this scheme.
We found that the idea of carrying physical devices increases perceived
personal responsibility for secure authentication, making the risks and
inconvenience associated with loss and theft salient for participants. Although
our work is focused on Pico, the results of the study contribute to a broader
understanding of user perception and concerns of responsibility for any
token-based authentication schemes."
"We study the changes in emotional states induced by reading and participating
in online discussions, empirically testing a computational model of online
emotional interaction. Using principles of dynamical systems, we quantify
changes in valence and arousal through subjective reports, as recorded in three
independent studies including 207 participants (110 female). In the context of
online discussions, the dynamics of valence and arousal are composed of two
forces: an internal relaxation towards baseline values independent of the
emotional charge of the discussion, and a driving force of emotional states
that depends on the content of the discussion. The dynamics of valence show the
existence of positive and negative tendencies, while arousal increases when
reading emotional content regardless of its polarity. The tendency of
participants to take part in the discussion increases with positive arousal.
When participating in an online discussion, the content of participants'
expression depends on their valence, and their arousal significantly decreases
afterwards as a regulation mechanism. We illustrate how these results allow the
design of agent-based models to reproduce and analyze emotions in online
communities. Our work empirically validates the microdynamics of a model of
online collective emotions, bridging online data analysis with research in the
laboratory."
"Smart phone and tablet usage has sharply increased for the last decade. While
entering test on these devices, virtual keyboards are generally used instead of
conventional hardware keyboards. In this study, a new problem which is
two-finger keyboard layout problem and solution approach is presented for
increasing user test entrance performance, especially on virtual keyboards.
Defined two-finger keyboard layout problem is modeled as Quadratic Assignment
Problem. Because of combinatorial structure of the problem a genetic algorithm
is developed. Its result is given to mathematical model as initial solution for
finding better solutions with mathematical model. Proposed approach is applied
on Turkish language. The new two finger keyboard layout for Turkish language is
compared with F and QWERTY keyboard layouts based on certain performance
measurement techniques."
"Preventable medical errors are a severe problem in healthcare, causing over
400,000 deaths per year in the US in hospitals alone. In acute care, the branch
of medicine encompassing the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units
(ICU), error rates may be higher to due low situational awareness among
clinicians performing resuscitation on patients. To support cognition, novice
team leaders may rely on reference guides to direct and anticipate future
steps. However, guides often act as a fixation point, diverting the leader's
attention away from the team. To address this issue, we conducted a qualitative
study that evaluates a collaborative cognitive aid co-designed with clinicians
called Visual TASK. Our study explored the use of Visual TASK in three
simulations employing a projected shared display with two different interaction
modalities: the Microsoft Kinect and a touchscreen. Our results suggest that
tools like the Kinect, while useful in other areas of acute care like the OR,
are unsuitable for use in high-stress situations like resuscitation. We also
observed that fixation may not be constrained to reference guides alone, and
may extend to other objects in the room. We present our findings, and a
discussion regarding future avenues in which collaborative cognitive aids may
help in improving situational awareness in resuscitation."
"The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our
behavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination
with the introduction of power efficient wireless communication technologies,
such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered
to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build
entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to
facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a
number of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the
user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of
people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the
received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning
of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving
seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate
the use of a seamful approach, i.e. to reveal and exploit these problems and
turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the
viability of this approach, we designed, implemented and evaluated the Ghost
Detector - an educational location-based museum game for children. By
presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design
decisions, this paper provides insight into some of the challenges and possible
solutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled
experiences for public cultural spaces."
"Coordinated multi-display environments from the desktop, second-screen to
gigapixel display walls are increasingly common. Personal and intimate mobile
and wearable devices such as head-mounted displays, smartwatches, smartphones
and tablets are rarely part of such multi-device ecosystems. With this paper,
we contribute to a better understanding about factors that impede the creation
and use of such mobile multi-device ecosystems. We base our findings on
literature research and an expert survey. Specifically, we present grounded
challenges relevant for the design, development and use of mobile multi-device
environments."
"This paper summarizes current notes about a new mixed-reality paradigm that
we named as ""pervasive virtuality"". This paradigm has emerged recently in
industry and academia through different initiatives. In this paper we intend to
explore this new area by proposing a set of features that we identified as
important or helpful to realize pervasive virtuality in games and entertainment
applications."
"This paper presents the first systematic investigation of the potential
performance gains for crowd work systems, deriving from available information
at the requester about individual worker reputation. In particular, we first
formalize the optimal task assignment problem when workers' reputation
estimates are available, as the maximization of a monotone (submodular)
function subject to Matroid constraints. Then, being the optimal problem
NP-hard, we propose a simple but efficient greedy heuristic task allocation
algorithm. We also propose a simple ""maximum a-posteriori"" decision rule and a
decision algorithm based on message passing. Finally, we test and compare
different solutions, showing that system performance can greatly benefit from
information about workers' reputation. Our main findings are that: i) even
largely inaccurate estimates of workers' reputation can be effectively
exploited in the task assignment to greatly improve system performance; ii) the
performance of the maximum a-posteriori decision rule quickly degrades as
worker reputation estimates become inaccurate; iii) when workers' reputation
estimates are significantly inaccurate, the best performance can be obtained by
combining our proposed task assignment algorithm with the message-passing
decision algorithm."
"Cartograms combine statistical and geographical information in thematic maps,
where areas of geographical regions (e.g., countries, states) are scaled in
proportion to some statistic (e.g., population, income). Cartograms make it
possible to gain insight into patterns and trends in the world around us and
have been very popular visualizations for geo-referenced data for over a
century. This work surveys cartogram research in visualization, cartography and
geometry, covering a broad spectrum of different cartogram types: from the
traditional rectangular and table cartograms, to Dorling and diffusion
cartograms. A particular focus is the study of the major cartogram dimensions:
statistical accuracy, geographical accuracy, and topological accuracy. We
review the history of cartograms, describe the algorithms for generating them,
and consider task taxonomies. We also review quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, and we use these to arrive at design guidelines and research
challenges."
"Data visualizations typically show retrospective views of an existing dataset
with little or no focus on repeatability. However, consumers of these tools
often use insights gleaned from retrospective visualizations as the basis for
decisions about future events. In this way, visualizations often serve as
visual predictive models despite the fact that they are typically designed to
present historical views of the data. This ""visual predictive model"" approach,
however, can lead to invalid inferences. In this paper, we describe an approach
to visual model validation called Inline Replication (IR) which, similar to the
cross-validation technique used widely in machine learning, provides a
nonparametric and broadly applicable technique for visual model assessment and
repeatability. This paper describes the overall IR process and outlines how it
can be integrated into both traditional and emerging ""big data"" visualization
pipelines. Examples are provided showing IR integrated within common
visualization techniques (such as bar charts and linear regression lines) as
well as a more fully-featured visualization system designed for complex
exploratory analysis tasks."
"Gamification initiatives are currently top-of-mind for many organizations
seeking to engage their employees in creative ways, improve their productivity,
and drive positive behavioural outcomes in their workforce - ultimately leading
to positive business outcomes on the whole. Despite its touted benefits, little
empirical research has been done to date to investigate technological and
individual personal factors that determine the success or failure of enterprise
gamification initiatives. In this article, we provide a summary of our
preliminary research findings from three case studies of gamification
initiatives across different business contexts and present an empirically
validated descriptive framework that details the key success factors for
enterprise gamification. Our adaptation of the mechanics, dynamics, and
aesthetics (MDA) framework for enterprise gamification aims to explicate the
connections between end-user motivations, interactive gameplay elements, and
technology features and functions that constitute effective gamification
interventions in the enterprise. Following a discussion of the core elements in
the framework and their interrelationships, the implications of our research
are presented in the form of guidelines for the management and design of
gamification initiatives and applications. The research findings presented in
this article can potentially aid in the development of game mechanics that
translate into positive user experiences and foster higher levels of employee
engagement. Additionally, our research findings provide insights on key success
factors for the effective adoption and institutionalization of enterprise
gamification initiatives in organizations, and subsequently help them enhance
the performance of their employees and drive positive business outcomes."
"Nowadays computer science can create digital worlds that deeply immerse
users; it can also process in real time brain activity to infer their inner
states. What marvels can we achieve with such technologies? Go back to
displaying text. And unfold a story that follows and molds users as never
before."
"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices between
humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as
electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications , however the dissemination
of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In
this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade
OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an
original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of
electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a
simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the
electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any
possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding
""ideal"" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested
-- the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300
speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board -- or a
similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip -- could be an
effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade
equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG
readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be
suitable for popularizing BCI uses."
"Individuals with severe paralysis require hands-free interfaces to control
assistive devices that can improve their quality of life. We present
ChinMotion, an interface that noninvasively harnesses preserved chin, lip and
tongue sensorimotor function after tetraplegia to convey intuitive control
commands. After two hours of practice, ChinMotion enables superior
point-and-click performance over existing interfaces and it facilitates
accurate 3D control of a virtual robotic arm."
"Just as AI has moved away from classical AI, human-computer interaction (HCI)
must move away from what I call 'good old fashioned HCI' to 'new HCI' - it must
become a part of cognitive systems research where HCI is one case of the
interaction of intelligent agents (we now know that interaction is essential
for intelligent agents anyway). For such interaction, we cannot just 'analyze
the data', but we must assume intentions in the other, and I suggest these are
largely recognized through resistance to carrying out one's own intentions.
This does not require fully cognitive agents but can start at a very basic
level. New HCI integrates into cognitive systems research and designs
intentional systems that provide resistance to the human agent."
"The main challenges in large-scale people tracking are the recognition of
people density in a specific area and tracking the people flow path. To address
these challenges, we present SenseFlow, a lightweight people tracking system.
SenseFlow utilises off-the-shelf devices which sniff probe requests
periodically polled by user's smartphones in a passive manner. We demonstrate
the feasibility of SenseFlow by building a proof-of-concept prototype and
undertaking extensive evaluations in real-world settings. We deploy the system
in one laboratory to study office hours of researchers, a crowded public area
in city to evaluate the scalability and performance ""in the wild"", and four
classrooms in the university to monitor the number of students. We also
evaluate SenseFlow with varying walking speeds and different models of
smartphones to investigate the people flow tracking performance."
"Maps --- specifically floor plans --- are useful for a variety of tasks from
arranging furniture to designating conceptual or functional spaces (e.g.,
kitchen, walkway). We present a simple algorithm for quickly laying a floor
plan (or other conceptual map) onto a SLAM map, creating a one-to-one mapping
between them. Our goal was to enable using a floor plan (or other hand-drawn or
annotated map) in robotic applications instead of the typical SLAM map created
by the robot. We look at two use cases, specifying ""no-go"" regions within a
room and locating objects within a scanned room. Although a user study showed
no statistical difference between the two types of maps in terms of performance
on this spatial memory task, we argue that floor plans are closer to the mental
maps people would naturally draw to characterize spaces."
"Current machine algorithms for analysis of unstructured data typically show
low accuracies due to the need for human-like intelligence. Conversely, though
humans are much better than machine algorithms on analyzing unstructured data,
they are unpredictable, slower and can be erroneous or even malicious as
computing agents. Therefore, a hybrid platform that can intelligently
orchestrate machine and human computing resources would potentially be capable
of providing significantly better benefits compared to either type of computing
agent in isolation. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid human-machine
computing platform with integrated service level objectives (SLO) management
for complex tasks that can be decomposed into a dependency graph where nodes
represent subtasks. Initial experimental results are highly encouraging. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that attempts to design such a
hybrid human-machine computing platform with support for addressing the three
SLO parameters of accuracy, budget and completion time."
"Virtual colonoscopy (VC) allows a physician to virtually navigate within a
reconstructed 3D colon model searching for colorectal polyps. Though VC is
widely recognized as a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying
polyps, one limitation is the reading time, which can take over 30 minutes per
patient. Large amounts of the colon are often devoid of polyps, and a way of
identifying these polyp-free segments could be of valuable use in reducing the
required reading time for the interrogating radiologist. To this end, we have
tested the ability of the collective crowd intelligence of non-expert workers
to identify polyp candidates and polyp-free regions. We presented twenty short
videos flying through a segment of a virtual colon to each worker, and the
crowd was asked to determine whether or not a possible polyp was observed
within that video segment. We evaluated our framework on Amazon Mechanical Turk
and found that the crowd was able to achieve a sensitivity of 80.0% and
specificity of 86.5% in identifying video segments which contained a clinically
proven polyp. Since each polyp appeared in multiple consecutive segments, all
polyps were in fact identified. Using the crowd results as a first pass, 80% of
the video segments could in theory be skipped by the radiologist, equating to a
significant time savings and enabling more VC examinations to be performed."
"A plethora of biometric measures have been proposed in the past. In this
paper we introduce a new potential biometric measure: the human tremor. We
present a new method for identifying the user of a handheld device using
characteristics of the hand tremor measured with a smartphone built-in inertial
sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). The main challenge of the proposed
method is related to the fact that human normal tremor is very subtle while we
aim to address real-life scenarios. To properly address the issue, we have
relied on weighted Fourier linear combiner for retrieving only the tremor data
from the hand movement and random forest for actual recognition. We have
evaluated our method on a database with 10 000 samples from 17 persons reaching
an accuracy of 76%."
"Wearable devices such as Google Glass can provide an efficient way to get
around users information. We present Face Card, a system builds on Google Glass
to provide information-sharing service with around people. With a look at
Google Glass, users can quickly get information of nearby and coming users.
Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and proper user interface, Face Card
demonstrates the potential of being an efficient information sharing system
framework."
"Understanding human mobility is important for the development of intelligent
mobile service robots as it can provide prior knowledge and predictions of
human distribution for robot-assisted activities. In this paper, we propose a
probabilistic method to model human motion behaviors which is determined by
both internal and external factors in an indoor environment. While the internal
factors are represented by the individual preferences, aims and interests, the
external factors are indicated by the stimulation of the environment. We model
the randomness of human macro-level movement, e.g., the probability of visiting
a specific place and staying time, under the Bayesian framework, considering
the influence of both internal and external variables. We use two case studies
in a shopping mall and in a college student dorm building to show the
effectiveness of our proposed probabilistic human mobility model. Real
surveillance camera data are used to validate the proposed model together with
survey data in the case study of student dorm."
"One of the challenges in affect recognition is accurate estimation of the
emotion intensity level. This research proposes development of an affect
intensity estimation model based on a weighted sum of classification confidence
levels, displacement of feature points and speed of feature point motion. The
parameters of the model were calculated from data captured using multiple
modalities such as face, body posture, hand movement and speech. A preliminary
study was conducted to compare the accuracy of the model with the annotated
intensity levels. An emotion intensity scale ranging from 0 to 1 along the
arousal dimension in the emotion space was used. Results indicated speech and
hand modality significantly contributed in improving accuracy in emotion
intensity estimation using the proposed model."
"In this paper we present a mobile crowdsourcing platform CrowdCafe, where
people can perform microtasks using their smartphones while they ride a bus,
travel by train, stand in a queue or wait for an appointment. These microtasks
are executed in exchange for rewards provided by local stores, such as coffee,
desserts and bus tickets. We present the concept, the implementation and the
evaluation by conducting a study with 52 participants, having 1108 tasks
completed."
"Crowd-labeling emerged from the need to label large-scale and complex data, a
tedious, expensive, and time-consuming task. One of the main challenges in the
crowd-labeling task is to control for or determine in advance the proportion of
low-quality/malicious labelers. If that proportion grows too high, there is
often a phase transition leading to a steep, non-linear drop in labeling
accuracy as noted by Karger et al. [2014]. To address these challenges, we
propose a new framework called Expert Label Injected Crowd Estimation (ELICE)
and extend it to different versions and variants that delay phase transition
leading to a better labeling accuracy. ELICE automatically combines and boosts
bulk crowd labels supported by labels from experts for limited number of
instances from the dataset. The expert-labels help to estimate the individual
ability of crowd labelers and difficulty of each instance, both of which are
used to aggregate the labels. Empirical evaluation shows the superiority of
ELICE as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We also derive a lower
bound on the number of expert-labeled instances needed to estimate the crowd
ability and dataset difficulty as well as to get better quality labels."
"A class of brain computer interfaces (BCIs) employs noninvasive recordings of
electroencephalography (EEG) signals to enable users with severe speech and
motor impairments to interact with their environment and social network. For
example, EEG based BCIs for typing popularly utilize event related potentials
(ERPs) for inference. Presentation paradigm design in current ERP-based letter
by letter typing BCIs typically query the user with an arbitrary subset
characters. However, the typing accuracy and also typing speed can potentially
be enhanced with more informed subset selection and flash assignment. In this
manuscript, we introduce the active recursive Bayesian state estimation
(active-RBSE) framework for inference and sequence optimization. Prior to
presentation in each iteration, rather than showing a subset of randomly
selected characters, the developed framework optimally selects a subset based
on a query function. Selected queries are made adaptively specialized for users
during each intent detection. Through a simulation-based study, we assess the
effect of active-RBSE on the performance of a language-model assisted typing
BCI in terms of typing speed and accuracy. To provide a baseline for
comparison, we also utilize standard presentation paradigms namely, row and
column matrix presentation paradigm and also random rapid serial visual
presentation paradigms. The results show that utilization of active-RBSE can
enhance the online performance of the system, both in terms of typing accuracy
and speed."
"This research project aims at developing a low-cost, time-effective and a
stand-alone graphical user interface (GUI) that will be used to design
microwave filters. Throughout the projects, the main theory behind the
technology of microwave filters, their generalized mathematical equations and
the analysis of their different circuit topologies have been reviewed. This
review helps to extract the necessary information needed for the design of
microwave filters. Besides, the guiding principles and the underlying
engineering factors for a successful and information-oriented GUI were also
highlighted. To carry out the project, the High-Level GUI Development
Environment (GUIDE) together with a structured programming approach have been
used to design the GUI, and to program its related functionalities. The
frequency responses are generated by using the generalized equation of each
filter class and type; and by using their different circuit topologies (Shunt
or Series topology). The GUI can also provide reactive element values from
given specification. Moreover, the features for the design of ultra-wideband
(UWB) band-pass filter, capacitively coupled and combline filter are also
incorporated into the stand-alone application. The finalized prototype will
serve both industries and educational institutions."
"We present the last of a series of three academic essays which deal with the
question of how and why to build a generalized player model. We propose that a
general player model needs parameters for subjective experience of play,
including: player psychology, game structure, and actions of play. Based on
this proposition, we pose three linked research questions: RQ1 what is a
necessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?; RQ2 can such a
foundation improve performance of a computational intelligence- based player
model?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve efficacy of adaptive artificial
intelligence in games?
  We set out the arguments behind these research questions in each of the three
essays, presented as three preprints. The third essay, in this preprint,
presents the argument that adaptive game artificial intelligence will be
enhanced by a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently
human artefacts which therefore, require some encoding of the human perspective
in order to effectively autonomously respond to the individual player. The
player model informs the necessary constraints on the adaptive artificial
intelligence. A generalised player model is not only more efficient than a
per-game solution, but also allows comparison between games which makes it a
useful tool for studying play in general. We describe the concept and meaning
of an adaptive game. We propose requirements for functional adaptive AI,
arguing from first principles drawn from the games research literature. We
propose solutions to these requirements, based on a formal model approach to
our existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:

Modelling using Psychology-Based Player Traits and Domain Specific Features.

"Exploring data requires a fast feedback loop from the analyst to the system,
with a latency below about 10 seconds because of human cognitive limitations.
When data becomes large or analysis becomes complex, sequential computations
can no longer be completed in a few seconds and data exploration is severely
hampered. This article describes a novel computation paradigm called
Progressive Computation for Data Analysis or more concisely Progressive
Analytics, that brings at the programming language level a low-latency
guarantee by performing computations in a progressive fashion. Moving this
progressive computation at the language level relieves the programmer of
exploratory data analysis systems from implementing the whole analytics
pipeline in a progressive way from scratch, streamlining the implementation of
scalable exploratory data analysis systems. This article describes the new
paradigm through a prototype implementation called ProgressiVis, and explains
the requirements it implies through examples."
"BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is a new wireless communication technology that,
thanks to reduced power consumption, promises to facilitate communication
between computing devices and help us harness their power in environments and
contexts previously untouched by information technology. Museums and other
facilities housing various cultural content are a particularly interesting area
of application. The University of Cambridge Museums consortium has put
considerable effort into researching the potential uses of emerging
technologies such as BLE to unlock new experiences enriching the way we engage
with cultural information. As a part of this research initiative, our ambition
has been to examine the challenges and opportunities introduced by the
introduction of a BLE-centred system into the museum context. We present an
assessment of the potential offered by this technology and of the design
approaches that might yield the best results when developing BLE-centred
experiences for museum environments. A pivotal part of our project consisted of
designing, developing and evaluating a prototype mobile location-based
BLE-centred game. A number of technical problems, such as unstable and
fluctuating signal strength, were encountered throughout the project lifecycle.
Instead of attempting to eliminate such problems, we argued in favour of
embracing them and turning them into a cornerstone of the gameplay. Our study
suggested that this alternative seamful design approach yields particularly
good results when deploying the technology in public environments. The project
outcome also demonstrated the potential of BLE-centred solutions to reach out
and engage new demographics, especially children, extending their interest in
museum visits."
"In this position paper, we present ideas about creating a next generation
framework towards an adaptive interface for data communication and
visualisation systems. Our objective is to develop a system that accepts large
data sets as inputs and provides user-centric, meaningful visual information to
assist owners to make sense of their data collection. The proposed framework
comprises four stages: (i) the knowledge base compilation, where we search and
collect existing state-ofthe-art visualisation techniques per domain and user
preferences; (ii) the development of the learning and inference system, where
we apply artificial intelligence techniques to learn, predict and recommend new
graphic interpretations (iii) results evaluation; and (iv) reinforcement and
adaptation, where valid outputs are stored in our knowledge base and the system
is iteratively tuned to address new demands. These stages, as well as our
overall vision, limitations and possible challenges are introduced in this
article. We also discuss further extensions of this framework for other
knowledge discovery tasks."
"This paper presents Living Globe, an application for visualization of demo-
graphic data supporting the temporal comparison of data from several countries
represented on a 3D globe. Living Globe allows the visual exploration of the
following demographic data: total population, population density and growth,
crude birth and death rates, life expectancy, net migration and population per-
centage of different age groups. While offering unexperienced users a default
mapping of these data variables into visual variables, Living Globe allows more
advanced users to select the mapping, increasing its flexibility. The main
aspects of the Living Globe model and prototype are described as well as the
evaluation results obtained using heuristic evaluation and usability testing.
Some conclusions and ideas for future work are also presented."
"This report describes a series of experiments that track novice programmer's
engagement during two attention based tasks. The tasks required participants to
watch a tutorial video on introductory programming and to attend to a simple
maze game whilst wearing an electroencephalogram (EEG)device called the Emotiv
EPOC. The EPOC's proprietary software includes a system which tracks emotional
state (specifically: engagement, excitement, meditation, frustration, valence
and long-term excitement). Using this data, a software application written in
the Processing language was developed to track user's engagement levels and
implement a neurofeedback based intervention when engagement fell below an
acceptable level. The aim of the intervention was to prompt learners who
disengaged with the task to re-engage. The intervention used during the video
tutorial was to pause the video if a participant disengaged significantly.
However other interventions such as slowing the video down, playing a noise or
darkening/brightening the screen could also be used. For the maze game, the
caterpillar moving through the maze slowed in line with disengagement and moved
more quickly once the learner re-engaged. The approach worked very well and
successfully re-engaged participants, although a number of improvements could
be made. A number of interesting findings on the comparative engagement levels
of different groups e.g. by gender and by age etc. were identified and provide
useful pointers for future research studies."
"In gaming, customizing individual characters, can create personal bonds
between players and their characters. Hence, character customization is a
standard component in many games. While mobile Augmented Reality (AR) games
become popular, to date, no 3D character editor for AR games exists. We
investigate the feasibility of 3D character customization for smartphone-based
AR in an iterative design process.
  Specifically, we present findings from creating AR prototypes in a handheld
AR setting. In a first user study, we found that a tangible AR prototype
resulted in higher hedonistic measures than a camera-based approach. In a
follow up study, we compared the tangible AR prototype with a non-AR
touchscreen version for selection, scaling, translation and rotation tasks in a
3D character customization setting. The tangible AR version resulted in
significantly better results for stimulation and novelty measures than the
non-AR version. At the same time, it maintained a proficient level in pragmatic

"The purpose of this research is to evaluate the human and technical factors
required to create a human-computer interface (HCI) for a structured reporting
solution based on eye-gaze and speech signals. Gaze and speech signals from
radiologists acquired during simulated image interpretation and dictation
sessions were analyzed to determine a) variation of temporal relationship
between eye gaze and speech in a dictation environment, and b) variation in eye
movements for a particular image interpretation task among radiologists.
Knowledge of these factors provides information regarding the complexity of the
image interpretation or dictation task, and provides information that can be
used to design a HCI for use in diagnostic radiology. Our ultimate goal is to
use these data to create an HCI to automate the generation of a particular type
of structured radiology report. Our data indicate that the a) temporal
relationships between eye gaze and speech and b) scan paths substantially vary
among radiologists, thus implying that an HCI system based on eye gaze and
speech for automating the capture of data for structured reporting processes
should be customized for each user. The image resolution and layout, image
content, and order of targets during an image interpretation session are not
relevant factors to consider when designing an HCI. Our findings can be applied
to the design of other HCI solutions for radiological applications that involve
visual inspection and verbal descriptions of image findings."
"Today, in the digital age, the mobile devices are more and more used to aid
people in the struggle to improve or maintain their health. In this paper, the
mobile eHealth solution for remote patient monitoring during clinical trials is
presented, together with the outcomes of quantitative and qualitative
performance evaluation. The evaluation is a third step to improve the quality
of the application after earlier Good Clinical Practice certification and
validation with the participation of 10 patients and three general
practitioners. This time, the focus was on the usability which was evaluated by
the seventeen participants divided into three age groups (18-28, 29-50, and
50+). The results, from recorded sessions and the eye tracking, show that there
is no difference in performance between the first group and the second group,
while for the third group the performance was worse, however, it was still good
enough to complete task within reasonable time."
"Analytical tools in business management are understood as a combination of
information technologies and quantitative methods used to assist stakeholders
to make better decisions. The contemporary business environment is dramatically
changing by the massive accumulation of data. Now, as never before, the use of
analytical tools must be expanded to take advantage of this growing digital
universe. This article will apply the laddering technique to see how personal
values (or managerial functions) influence a companys adoption of analytical
tools. A set of ten in-depth interviews are conducted with CEOs, analytics
consultants, academics and businessmen in order to establish quantitative
relations among attributes, consequences and personal values. Two easy-to-read
outputs are provided to interpret our results. The most important links are
quantitatively associated through an implication matrix, and then visually
represented on a hierarchical value map. Guidelines for improving the use of
analytical tools are provided in the last section"
"In this paper, we propose a new interface for virtual reality headset: a
touchpad in front of the headset. To demonstrate the feasibility of the front
touch interface, we built a prototype device, explored VR UI design space
expansion, and performed various user studies. We started with preliminary
tests to see how intuitively and accurately people can interact with the front
touchpad. Then, we further experimented various user interfaces such as a
binary selection, a typical menu layout, and a keyboard. Two-Finger and
Drag-n-Tap were also explored to find the appropriate selection technique. As a
low-cost, light-weight, and in low power budget technology, a touch sensor can
make an ideal interface for mobile headset. Also, front touch area can be large
enough to allow wide range of interaction types such as multi-finger
interactions. With this novel front touch interface, we paved a way to new
virtual reality interaction methods."
"Task allocation or participant selection is a key issue in Mobile Crowd
Sensing (MCS). While previous participant selection approaches mainly focus on
selecting a proper subset of users for a single MCS task, multi-task-oriented
participant selection is essential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale
MCS platforms. This paper proposes TaskMe, a participant selection framework
for multi-task MCS environments. In particular, two typical multi-task
allocation situations with bi-objective optimization goals are studied: (1) For
FPMT (few participants, more tasks), each participant is required to complete
multiple tasks and the optimization goal is to maximize the total number of
accomplished tasks while minimizing the total movement distance. (2) For MPFT
(more participants, few tasks), each participant is selected to perform one
task based on pre-registered working areas in view of privacy, and the
optimization objective is to minimize total incentive payments while minimizing
the total traveling distance. Two optimal algorithms based on the Minimum Cost
Maximum Flow theory are proposed for FPMT, and two algorithms based on the
multi-objective optimization theory are proposed for MPFT. Experiments verify
that the proposed algorithms outperform baselines based on a large-scale
real-word dataset under different experiment settings (the number of tasks,
various task distributions, etc.)."

"Albanian Sign Language (AlbSL) is relatively new and until now there doesn't
exist a system that is able to recognize Albanian signs by using natural user
interfaces (NUI). The aim of this paper is to present a real-time gesture
recognition system that is able to automatically recognize number signs for
Albanian Sign Language, captured from signer's both hands. Kinect device is
used to obtain data streams. Every pixel generated from Kinect device contains
depth data information which is used to construct a depth map. Hands
segmentation process is performed by applying a threshold constant to depth
map. In order to differentiate signer's hands a K-means clustering algorithm is
applied to partition pixels into two groups corresponding to each signer's
hands. Centroid distance function is calculated in each hand after extracting
hand's contour pixels. Fourier descriptors, derived form centroid distance is
used as a hand shape representation. For each number gesture there are 15
Fourier descriptors coefficients generated which represent uniquely that
gesture. Every input data is compared against training data set by calculating
Euclidean distance, using Fourier coefficients. Sign with the lowest Euclidean
distance is considered as a match. The system is able to recognize number signs
captured from one hand or both hands. When both signer's hands are used, some
of the methodology processes are executed in parallel in order to improve the
overall performance. The proposed system achieves an accuracy of 91% and is
able to process 55 frames per second."
"Human identification plays an important role in human-computer interaction.
There have been numerous methods proposed for human identification (e.g., face
recognition, gait recognition, fingerprint identification, etc.). While these
methods could be very useful under different conditions, they also suffer from
certain shortcomings (e.g., user privacy, sensing coverage range). In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for human identification, which leverages
WIFI signals to enable non-intrusive human identification in domestic
environments. It is based on the observation that each person has specific
influence patterns to the surrounding WIFI signal while moving indoors,
regarding their body shape characteristics and motion patterns. The influence
can be captured by the Channel State Information (CSI) time series of WIFI.
Specifically, a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) techniques is used for
CSI waveform-based human identification. We implemented the system in a 6m*5m
smart home environment and recruited 9 users for data collection and
evaluation. Experimental results indicate that the identification accuracy is
about 88.9% to 94.5% when the candidate user set changes from 6 to 2, showing
that the proposed human identification method is effective in domestic
environments."
"The monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Situation Report is widely
anticipated by economists, journalists, and politicians as it is used to
forecast the economic condition of the United States. The report has broad
impact on public and corporate economic confidence; however, the online access
to this data employs outdated techniques, using a PDF format containing solely
text and fixed tabular information. Creating an interactive interface for
dynamic discovery on the BLS website could elicit more dialogue between the
public and government spheres, drawing more traffic to government websites and
triggering greater civic engagement. Our work suggests that the implementation
of interactive visual analysis techniques to enable dynamic discovery leads to
rapid interpretation of data as well as provides the means to explore the data
for further insights. This paper presents two inspirational prototypes: a
dashboard of interactive visualizations and an interactive time series
explorer, allowing for temporal and spatial analyses and enabling users to
combine data sets to create their own customized visualization."
"The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  One of the most widely used signals is electrodermal activity, or EDA, also
known as galvanic skin response or GSR. This signal is commonly used as a proxy
for physiological arousal, but recent advances of interpretation and analysis
suggest that traditional approaches should be revised. We present a short
review on the application of EDA in human-computer interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid

designed to support the smoking cessation process through a mobile application.
We plan to use a hybrid RS (content-based, utility-based, and demographic

"With laptops and desktops, the dominant method of text entry is the full-size
keyboard; now with the ubiquity of mobile devices like smartphones, two new
widely used methods have emerged: miniature touch screen keyboards and
speech-based dictation. It is currently unknown how these two modern methods
compare. We therefore evaluated the text entry performance of both methods in
English and in Mandarin Chinese on a mobile smartphone. In the speech input
case, our speech recognition system gave an initial transcription, and then
recognition errors could be corrected using either speech again or the
smartphone keyboard. We found that with speech recognition, the English input
rate was 3.0x faster, and the Mandarin Chinese input rate 2.8x faster, than a
state-of-the-art miniature smartphone keyboard. Further, with speech, the
English error rate was 20.4% lower, and Mandarin error rate 63.4% lower, than
the keyboard. Our experiment was carried out using Deep Speech 2, a deep
learning-based speech recognition system, and the built-in Qwerty or Pinyin
(Mandarin) Apple iOS keyboards. These results show that a significant shift
from typing to speech might be imminent and impactful. Further research to
develop effective speech interfaces is warranted."

  Electromyography (EMG) is a useful signal to estimate the emotional context
of individuals, because it is relatively robust, and simple to record and
analyze. Common uses are to infer emotional valence in response to a stimulus,

"Several techniques for visualization of dynamic graphs are based on different
spatial arrangements of a temporal sequence of node-link diagrams. Many studies
in the literature have investigated the importance of maintaining the user's
mental map across this temporal sequence, but usually each layout is considered
as a static graph drawing and the effect of user interaction is disregarded. We
conducted a task-based controlled experiment to assess the effectiveness of two
basic interaction techniques: the adjustment of the layout stability and the
highlighting of adjacent nodes and edges. We found that generally both
interaction techniques increase accuracy, sometimes at the cost of longer
completion times, and that the highlighting outclasses the stability adjustment
for many tasks except the most complex ones."
"Online labor platforms, such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk, provide an
effective framework for eliciting responses to judgment tasks. Previous work
has shown that workers respond best to financial incentives, especially to
extra bonuses. However, most of the tested incentives involve describing the
bonus conditions in formulas instead of plain English. We believe that
different incentives given in English (or in qualitative framing) will result
in differences in workers' performance, especially when task difficulties vary.
In this paper, we report the preliminary results of a crowdsourcing experiment
comparing workers' performance using only qualitative framings of financial
incentives. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in workers'
performance using a specific well-formulated qualitative framing inspired by
the Peer Truth Serum. This positive effect is observed only when the difficulty
of the task is high, while when the task is easy there is no difference of
which incentives to use."
"Internal HITs on Mechanical Turk can be programmatically restrictive, and as
a result, many requesters turn to using external HITs as a more flexible
alternative. However, creating such HITs can be redundant and time-consuming.
We present MmmTurkey, a framework that enables researchers to not only quickly
create and manage external HITs, but more significantly also capture and record
detailed worker behavioral data characterizing how each worker completes a
given task."
"Information extraction is a critical step in the practice of conducting
biomedical systematic literature reviews. Extracted structured data can be
aggregated via methods such as statistical meta-analysis. Typically highly
trained domain experts extract data for systematic reviews. The high expense of
conducting biomedical systematic reviews has motivated researchers to explore
lower cost methods that achieve similar rigor without compromising quality.
Crowdsourcing represents one such promising approach. In this work-in-progress
study, we designed a crowdsourcing task for biomedical information extraction.
We briefly report the iterative design process and the results of two pilot
testings. We found that giving more concrete examples in the task instruction
can help workers better understand the task, especially for concepts that are
abstract and confusing. We found a few workers completed most of the work, and
our payment level appeared more attractive to workers from low-income
countries. In the future, we will further evaluate our results with reference
to gold standard extractions, thus assessing the feasibility of tasking crowd
workers with extracting biomedical intervention information for systematic
reviews."
"This work-in-progress paper describes a vision, i.e., that of fast and

participants that are typically hard to recruit. The goal of this work is to
study which user study methods can instead be crowdsourced to generic audiences
to enable the conduct of user studies without the need for expensive lab
experiments. The challenge is understanding how to conduct crowdsourced studies
without giving up too many of the guarantees in-lab settings are able to
provide."
"Most people do not know how much energy they are spending for different
purposes and also they are unaware of potential electrical consumption
reduction level they could make by changing their consumption behaviors or
investing in new efficient technology products. Providing electrical
consumption information to household and make the consumption information
tangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in
households. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on
electrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy
turning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is
possible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in
order to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the
knowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities.
Monitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption
and comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized.
Households received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral
change associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It
is also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption
display have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in
households. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1,
house 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that
further attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying
different type of monitor designs and implication of special designed
stimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with
their current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time
periods in order to analyze and try to reveal specific time periods for
specific consumption behaviors."
"Significant effort has been made to understand user motivation and to elicit
user participation in crowdsourcing systems. However, incentive engineering,
i.e., designing incentives that can purposefully motivate users, is still an
open question and remains one of the key challenges of crowdsourcing

appropriate incentives in order to effect desirable user behaviours."
"In the early stages of designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the look
(appearance) can be easily presented by sketching, but the feel (interactive
behaviors) cannot, and often requires an accompanying description of how it
works (Myers et al. 2008). We propose to use crowdsourcing to augment early
sketches with interactive behaviors generated, used, and reused by collective
""wizards-of-oz"" as opposed to a single wizard as in prior work (Davis et al.
2007). This demo presents an extension of Apparition (Lasecki et al. 2015), a
crowd-powered prototyping tool that allows end users to create functional GUIs
using speech and sketch. In Apparition, crowd workers collaborate in real-time
on a shared canvas to refine the user-requested sketch interactively, and with
the assistance of the end users. Our demo extends this functionality to let
crowd workers ""demonstrate"" the canvas changes that are needed for a behavior
and refine their demonstrations to improve the fidelity of interactive
behaviors. The system then lets workers ""remix"" these behaviors to make
creating future behaviors more efficient."
"Providing opinions through labeling of images, tweets, etc. have drawn
immense interest in crowdsourcing markets. This invokes a major challenge of
aggregating multiple opinions received from different crowd workers for
deriving the final judgment. Generally, opinion aggregation models deal with
independent opinions, which are given unanimously and are not visible to all.
However, in many real-life cases, it is required to make the opinions public as
soon as they are received. This makes the opinions dependent and might
incorporate some bias. In this paper, we address a novel problem, hereafter
denoted as dependent judgment analysis, and discuss the requirements for
developing an appropriate model to deal with this problem. The challenge
remains to be improving the consensus by revealing true opinions."

"Wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors have been successfully applied in
many medical and computer brain interface classifications. A common
characteristic of wireless EEG sensors is that they are low powered devices,
and hence an efficient usage of sensor energy resources is critical for any
practical application. One way of minimizing energy consumption by the EEG
sensors is by reducing the number of EEG channels participating in the
classification process. For the purpose of classifying EEG signals, we propose
a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based channel selection algorithm. To achieve
this objective, the EEG sensor channels are first realized in a complete
undirected graph, where each channel is represented by a node. An edge between
any two nodes indicates the collaboration between these nodes in identifying
the system state; and the significance of this collaboration is quantified by a
weight assigned to the edge. The complete graph is then reduced into a directed
acyclic graph that encodes the knowledge of the non-increasing order of the
channel ranking for each cognitive task. The channel selection algorithm
utilizes this directed graph to find a maximum path such that the total weight
of this path satisfies a predefined threshold. It has been demonstrated
experimentally that channel utilization has been reduced by 50% in the worst
case scenario for a three-state system and an EEG sensor with 14 channels; and
the best classification accuracy obtained is 81%."
"Crowdsourcing environments have shown promise in solving diverse tasks in
limited cost and time. This type of business model involves both the expert and
non-expert workers. Interestingly, the success of such models depends on the
volume of the total number of workers. But, the survival of the fittest
controls the stability of these workers. Here, we show that the crowd workers
who fail to win jobs successively loose interest and might dropout over time.
Therefore, dropout prediction in such environments is a promising task. In this
paper, we establish that it is possible to predict the dropouts in a
crowdsourcing market from the success rate based on the arrival pattern of
workers."

"The virtuality continuum describes the degrees of positive virtuality under
the umbrella term mixed reality. Besides adding virtual information within a
mixed environment, diminished reality aims at reducing real world information.
Mann defined the term mediated reality (MR), which also considered diminished
reality, but without the possibility to describe different degrees of fusion
between a mixed and a diminished reality. That is why this work defines the new
term blending entropy that captures the relations between a mixed and a
diminished reality. The blending entropy is based on the information density of

named perceptual frustum. We describe the blending entropy's twodimensional

"The main aim of our study was to analyse the effects of a virtual environment
on social conformity, with particular attention to the effects of different
types of task and psychological variables on social influence, on one side, and
to the neural correlates related to conformity, measured by means of an Emotiv
EPOC device on the other. For our purpose, we replicated the famous Asch's
visual task and created two new tasks of increasing ambiguity, assessed through
the calculation of the item's entropy. We also administered five scales in
order to assess different psychological traits. From the experiment, conducted
on 181 university students, emerged that conformity grows according to the
ambiguity of the task, but normative influence is significantly weaker in
virtual environments, if compared to face-to-face experiments. The analysed
psycho-logical traits, however, result not to be relatable to conformity, and
they only affect the subjects' response times. From the ERP (Event-related
potentials) analysis, we detected N200 and P300 components comparing the plots

"In this paper we provide two introductory analyses of CAPs, based exclusively
on the analysis of documents found on the Internet. The first analysis allowed
us to investigate the world of CAPs, in particular for what concerned their
status (dead or alive), the scope of those platforms and the typology of users.
In order to develop a more accurate model of CAPs, and to understand more
deeply the motivation of the users and the type of expected payoff, we analysed
those CAPs from the above list that are still alive and we used two models
developed for what concerned the virtual community and the collective
intelligence."
"In this paper we describe the design and validation of a virtual fitness
environment aiming at keeping older adults physically and socially active. We
target particularly older adults who are socially more isolated, physically
less active, and with less chances of training in a gym. The virtual fitness
environment, namely Gymcentral, was designed to enable and motivate older
adults to follow personalised exercises from home, with a (heterogeneous) group
of remote friends and under the remote supervision of a Coach. We take the
training activity as an opportunity to create social interactions, by
complementing training features with social instruments. Finally, we report on
the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual environment, as well as its
effects on the usage and social interactions, from an intervention study in
Trento, Italy"
"Graphical interfaces and interactive visualisations are typical mediators
between human users and data analytics systems. HCI researchers and developers
have to be able to understand both human needs and back-end data analytics.
Participants of our tutorial will learn how visualisation and interface design
can be combined with data analytics to provide better visualisations. In the
first of three parts, the participants will learn about visualisations and how
to appropriately select them. In the second part, restrictions and
opportunities associated with different data analytics systems will be
discussed. In the final part, the participants will have the opportunity to
develop visualisations and interface designs under given scenarios of data and
system settings."
"Both dialogue systems and chatbots aim at putting into action communication
between humans and computers. However, instead of focusing on sophisticated
techniques to perform natural language understanding, as the former usually do,
chatbots seek to mimic conversation. Since Eliza, the first chatbot ever,
developed in 1966, there were many interesting ideas explored by the chatbots'
community. Actually, more than just ideas, some chatbots' developers also
provide free resources, including tools and large-scale corpora. It is our
opinion that this know-how and materials should not be neglected, as they might
be put to use in the human-computer communication field (and some authors
already do it). Thus, in this paper we present a historical overview of the
chatbots' developments, we review what we consider to be the main contributions
of this community, and we point to some possible ways of coupling these with
current work in the human-computer communication research line."
"The application of psychophysiologicy in human-computer interaction is a

  Eye tracking is a widely used method for tracking user attention with gaze
location, but also provides information on the internal cognitive and
contextual state, intention, and the locus of the user's visual attention in

"Drawing principles, or aesthetics, are important in graph drawing. They are
used as criteria for algorithm design and for quality evaluation. Current
aesthetics are described as visual properties that a drawing is required to
have to be visually pleasing. However, most of these aesthetics are originally
proposed without consideration of graph structure information. Therefore their
ability in visually revealing graph structural features are not guaranteed and
indeed mixed results have been reported in the literature regarding their
impact on user graph comprehension. In this paper, we propose to derive
aesthetics based on graph internal structural features. Further, graphs are
often evaluated based on controlled experiments with simple perception tasks to
avoid possible confounding factors caused by complex tasks. This leaves their
value in supporting complex tasks unevaluated. To fill this gap, we also
discuss the possibility of applying evaluation methodologies used in the
Cognitive Load Theory research for graph evaluation."
"The application of psychophysiological measures in human-computer interaction
is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised

"The advent of mobile health technologies presents new challenges that
existing visualizations, interactive tools, and algorithms are not yet designed
to support. In dealing with uncertainty in sensor data and high-dimensional
physiological records, we must seek to improve current tools that make sense of
health data from traditional perspectives in event-based trend discovery. With
Chronodes, a system developed to help researchers collect, interpret, and model
mobile health (mHealth) data, we posit a series of interaction techniques that
enable new approaches to understanding and exploring event-based data. From
numerous and discontinuous mobile health data streams, Chronodes finds and
visualizes frequent event sequences that reveal common chronological patterns
across participants and days. By then promoting the sequences as interactive
elements, Chronodes presents opportunities for finding, defining, and comparing
cohorts of participants that exhibit particular behaviors. We applied Chronodes
to a real 40GB mHealth dataset capturing about 400 hours of data. Through our
pilot study with 20 behavioral and biomedical health experts, we gained
insights into Chronodes' efficacy, limitations, and potential applicability to
a wide range of healthcare scenarios."
"We study user preference between allocentric and egocentric 3D manipulation
on mobile devices, in a configuration where the motion of the device is applied
to an object displayed on the device itself. We first evaluate this preference
for translations and for rotations alone, then for full 6-DOF manipulation. We
also investigate the role of contextual cues by performing this experiment in
different 3D scenes. Finally, we look at the specific influence of each
manipulation axis. Our results provide guidelines to help interface designers
select an appropriate default mapping in this locally coupled configuration."
"Interest makes one hold her attention on the object of interest. Automatic
recognition of interest has numerous applications in human-computer
interaction. In this paper, we study the facial expressions associated with
interest and its underlying and closely related components, namely, curiosity,
coping potential, novelty and complexity. To this end, we conducted an
experiment in which participants watched images and micro-videos while a
front-facing camera recorded their expressions. After watching each item they
self-reported their level of interest, curiosity, coping potential and
perceived novelty and complexity. Using an automated method, we tracked facial
action units (AU) and studied the relationship between the presence of facial
movements with interest and its related components. We then tracked the facial
landmarks, e.g., corners of lips, and extracted features from each response. We
trained random forests regression models to detect the level of interest,
curiosity, and appraisals. We found a large difference between the way people
report and react to interesting visual content. The expressions in response to
images and micro-videos were not always pronounced depending on the
participants. This makes the direct detection of interest from facial
expressions a challenging problem. With this work, for the first time, we
demonstrate the feasibility of detecting cognitive appraisals from facial
expressions which will open the door for appraisal-driven emotion recognition
methods."
"The advent of abundant on-board sensors and electronic devices in vehicles
populates the paradigm of participatory sensing to harness crowd-sourced data
gathering for intelligent transportation applications, such as
distance-to-empty prediction and eco-routing. While participatory sensing can
provide diverse driving data, there lacks a systematic study of effective
utilization of the data for personalized prediction. There are considerable
challenges on how to interpolate the missing data from a sparse dataset, which
often arises from participatory sensing. This paper presents and compares
various approaches for personalized vehicle energy consumption prediction,
including a blackbox framework that identifies
driver/vehicle/environment-dependent factors and a collaborative filtering
approach based on matrix factorization. Furthermore, a case study of
distance-to-empty prediction for electric vehicles by participatory sensing
data is conducted and evaluated empirically, which shows that our approaches
can significantly improve the prediction accuracy."
"The movement of a user's face, easily detected by a smartphone's front
camera, is an underexploited input modality for mobile interactions. We
introduce three sets of face-engaged interaction techniques for augmenting the
traditional mobile inputs, which leverages the combination of the head
movements with touch gestures and device motions, all sensed via the phone's
built-in sensors. We systematically present the space of design considerations
for mobile interactions using one or more of the three input modalities (i.e.,
touch, motion, and head). The additional affordances of the proposed techniques
expand the mobile interaction vocabulary, and can facilitate unique usage
scenarios such as one-hand or touch-free interaction. An initial evaluation was
conducted and users had positive reactions to the new techniques, indicating
the promise of an intuitive and convenient user experience."
"Lecture notes are important for students to review and understand the key
points in the class. Unfortunately, the students often miss or lose part of the
lecture notes. In this paper, we design and implement an infrared sensor based
system, InfraNotes, to automatically record the notes on the board by sensing
and analyzing hand gestures of the lecturer. Compared with existing techniques,
our system does not require special accessories with lecturers such as
sensor-facilitated pens, writing surfaces or the video-taping infrastructure.
Instead, it only has an infrared-sensor module on the eraser holder of
black/white board to capture handwritten trajectories. With a lightweight
framework for handwritten trajectory processing, clear lecture notes can be
generated automatically. We evaluate the quality of lecture notes by three
standard character recognition techniques. The results indicate that InfraNotes
is a promising solution to create clear and complete lectures to promote the
education."
"The availability heuristic is a strategy that people use to make quick
decisions but often lead to systematic errors. We propose three ways that
visualization could facilitate unbiased decision-making. First, visualizations
can alter the way our memory stores the events for later recall, so as to
improve users' long-term intuitions. Second, the known biases could lead to new
visualization guidelines. Third, we suggest the design of decision-making tools
that are inspired by heuristics, e.g. suggesting intuitive approximations,
rather than target to present exhaustive comparisons of all possible outcomes,
or automated solutions for choosing decisions."
"Instant messaging and push notifications play important roles in modern
digital life. To enable robust sense-making and rich context awareness in
computer mediated communications, we introduce EmotionPush, a system that
automatically conveys the emotion of received text with a colored push
notification on mobile devices. EmotionPush is powered by state-of-the-art
emotion classifiers and is deployed for Facebook Messenger clients on Android.
The study showed that the system is able to help users prioritize interactions."
"Crowdsourcing is the primary means to generate training data at scale, and
when combined with sophisticated machine learning algorithms, crowdsourcing is
an enabler for a variety of emergent automated applications impacting all
spheres of our lives. This paper surveys the emerging field of formally
reasoning about and optimizing open-ended crowdsourcing, a popular and
crucially important, but severely understudied class of crowdsourcing---the
next frontier in crowdsourced data management. The underlying challenges
include distilling the right answer when none of the workers agree with each
other, teasing apart the various perspectives adopted by workers when answering
tasks, and effectively selecting between the many open-ended operators
appropriate for a problem. We describe the approaches that we've found to be
effective for open-ended crowdsourcing, drawing from our experiences in this
space."
"Mobile applications and on-body devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous
tools for physical activity tracking. We propose utilizing a self-tracker's
habits to support continuous prediction of whether they will reach their daily
step goal, thus enabling a variety of potential persuasive interventions. Our
aim is to improve the prediction by leveraging historical data and other
qualitative (motivation for using the systems, location, gender) and,
quantitative (age) features. We have collected datasets from two activity
tracking platforms (Moves and Fitbit) and aim to check if the model we derive
from one is generalizable over the other. In the following paper we establish a
pipeline for extracting the data and formatting it for modeling. We discuss the
approach we took and our findings while selecting the features and
classification models for the dataset. We further discuss the notion of
generalizability of the model across different types of dataset and the
probable inclusion of non standard features to further improve the model's
accuracy."
"The arrival of head-mounted displays (HMDs) to the consumer market requires a
novel content format that is, first, adapted to the specificities of immersive
displays and, second, that takes into account the current reality of
multi-display media consumption. We review the requirements for such content
format and report on existing initiatives, some of our own, towards
implementing such content format."
"Distributed, parallel crowd workers can accomplish simple tasks through
workflows, but teams of collaborating crowd workers are necessary for complex
goals. Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams - familiarity
with other members - stands in contrast to crowd work's flexible, on-demand
nature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to
assemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time
constraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for
highly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first
present a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd
teams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar)
teams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment
wherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18
minutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term,
team-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work."
"While smartphones are widely used for web browsing, also other novel devices
like Smart TVs become increasingly popular. Yet, current interfaces do not
cater for the newly available devices beyond touch and small screens, if at all
for the latter. Particularly search engines--today's entry points of the
WWW--must ensure their interfaces are easy to use on any web-enabled device. We
report on a survey that investigated (1) users' perception and usage of current
search interfaces, and (2) their expectations towards current and future search
interfaces. Users are mostly satisfied with desktop and mobile search, but seem
to be skeptical towards web search with novel devices and input modalities.
Hence, we derive REFOCUS--a novel set of requirements for current and future
search interfaces, which shall address the demand for improvement of novel web
search and has been validated by 12 dedicated experts."
"In this paper, we explore graphical passwords as a child-friendly alternative
for user authentication. We evaluate the usability of three variants of the
PassTiles graphical password scheme for children, and explore the similarities
and differences in performance and preferences between children and adults
while using these schemes. Children were most successful at recalling passwords
containing images of distinct objects. Both children and adults prefer
graphical passwords to their existing schemes, but password memorization
strategies differ considerably between the two groups. Based on our findings,
we provide recommendations for designing more child-friendly authentication
schemes."
"Problem-based visualization research provides explicit guidance toward
identifying and designing for the needs of users, but absent is more concrete
guidance toward factors external to a user's needs that also have implications
for visualization design and evaluation. This lack of more explicit guidance
can leave visualization researchers and practitioners vulnerable to unforeseen
constraints beyond the user's needs that can affect the validity of
evaluations, or even lead to the premature termination of a project. Here we
explore two types of external constraints in depth, regulatory and
organizational constraints, and describe how these constraints impact
visualization design and evaluation. By borrowing from techniques in software
development, project management, and visualization research we recommend
strategies for identifying, mitigating, and evaluating these external
constraints through a design study methodology. Finally, we present an
application of those recommendations in a healthcare case study. We argue that
by explicitly incorporating external constraints into visualization design and
evaluation, researchers and practitioners can improve the utility and validity
of their visualization solution and improve the likelihood of successful
collaborations with industries where external constraints are more present."
"Scholarly articles publishing and getting cited has become a way of life for
academicians. These scholarly publications shape up the career growth of not
only the authors but also of the country, continent and the technological
domains. Author affiliations, country and other information of an author
coupled with data analytics can provide useful and insightful results. However,
massive and complete data is required to perform this research. Google scholar
which is a comprehensive and free repository of scholarly articles has been
used as a data source for this purpose. Data scraped from Google scholar when
stored as a graph and visualized in the form of nodes and relationships, can
offer discerning and concealed information. Such as, evident domain shift of an
author, various research domains spread for an author, prediction of emerging
domain and sub domains, detection of journal and author level citation cartel
behaviors etc. The data from graph database is also used in computation of
scholastic indicators for the journals. Eventually, econometric model, named
Cobb Douglas model is used to compute the journals Modeling ""Internationality""
Index based on these scholastic indicators."
"Crowd workers are distributed and decentralized. While decentralization is
designed to utilize independent judgment to promote high-quality results, it
paradoxically undercuts behaviors and institutions that are critical to
high-quality work. Reputation is one central example: crowdsourcing systems
depend on reputation scores from decentralized workers and requesters, but
these scores are notoriously inflated and uninformative. In this paper, we draw
inspiration from historical worker guilds (e.g., in the silk trade) to design
and implement crowd guilds: centralized groups of crowd workers who
collectively certify each other's quality through double-blind peer assessment.
A two-week field experiment compared crowd guilds to a traditional
decentralized crowd work model. Crowd guilds produced reputation signals more
strongly correlated with ground-truth worker quality than signals available on
current crowd working platforms, and more accurate than in the traditional
model."
"There are many reasons for utilising 3D animation and virtual reality in
sexuality research. Apart from providing a mean with which to (re)experience
certain situations there are four main advantages: a) bespoke animated stimuli
can be created and customized, which is especially important when researching
paraphilia and sexual preferences, b) stimulus production is less expensive and
easier to produce compared to real world stimuli, c) virtual reality allows us
to capture data such as physiological reasons to stimuli, that we would not be
able to otherwise (without resorting to self-report measures which are
especially problematic in this research domain), d) ethical, legal, and health
and safety issues are less complex since neither physical nor psychological
harm is caused to animated characters allowing for the safe presentation of
stimuli involving vulnerable targets. The animation sub-group has been
exploring so far several production quality levels and various animation
procedures in a number of available software. The aim is to develop static as
well as dynamic, interactive sexual stimuli for sexual diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes. We are aware of number of ethical issues related to the
use of virtual reality in proposed research are analysed in this chapter."
"This paper presents a novel approach to simulate human wayfinding behaviour
incorporating visual cognition into a software agent for a computer aided
evaluation of wayfinding systems in large infrastructures. The proposed
approach follows the Sense-Plan-Act paradigm comprised of a model for visual
attention, navigation behaviour and pedestrian movement. Stochastic features of
perception are incorporated to enhance generality and diversity of the
developed wayfinding simulation to reflect a variety of behaviours. The
validity of the proposed approach was evaluated based on empirical data
collected through wayfinding experiments with 20 participants in an immersive
virtual reality environment using a life-sized 3D replica of Vienna's new
central railway station. The results show that the developed cognitive
agent-based simulation provides a further contribution to the simulation of
human wayfinding and subsequently a further step to an effective evaluation
tool for the planning of wayfinding and signage."
"Online creative communities allow creators to share their work with a large
audience, maximizing opportunities to showcase their work and connect with fans
and peers. However, sharing in-progress work can be technically and socially
challenging in environments designed for sharing completed pieces. We propose
an online creative community where sharing process, rather than showcasing
outcomes, is the main method of sharing creative work. Based on this, we
present Mosaic---an online community where illustrators share work-in-progress
snapshots showing how an artwork was completed from start to finish. In an
online deployment and observational study, artists used Mosaic as a vehicle for
reflecting on how they can improve their own creative process, developed a
social norm of detailed feedback, and became less apprehensive of sharing early
versions of artwork. Through Mosaic, we argue that communities oriented around
sharing creative process can create a collaborative environment that is
beneficial for creative growth."
"Crowdsourcing systems accomplish large tasks with scale and speed by breaking
work down into independent parts. However, many types of complex creative work,
such as fiction writing, have remained out of reach for crowds because work is
tightly interdependent: changing one part of a story may trigger changes to the
overall plot and vice versa. Taking inspiration from how expert authors write,
we propose a technique for achieving interdependent complex goals with crowds.
With this technique, the crowd loops between reflection, to select a high-level
goal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We
embody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short
fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical
Novel resulted in higher-quality stories than an iterative crowdsourcing
workflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level
goals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work."
"Screen-based Augmented Reality (AR) systems can be built as a window into the
real world as often done in mobile AR applications or using the Magic Mirror
metaphor, where users can see themselves with augmented graphics on a large
display. Such Magic Mirror systems have been used in digital clothing
environments to create virtual dressing rooms, to teach human anatomy, and for
collaborative design tasks. The term Magic Mirror implies that the display
shows the users enantiomorph, i.e. the mirror image, such that the system
mimics a real-world physical mirror. However, the question arises whether one
should design a traditional mirror, or instead display the true mirror image by
means of a non-reversing mirror? This is an intriguing perceptual question, as
the image one observes in a mirror is not a real view, as it would be seen by
an external observer, but a reflection, i.e. a front-to-back reversed image. In
this paper, we discuss the perceptual differences between these two mirror
visualization concepts and present a first comparative study in the context of
Magic Mirror anatomy teaching. We investigate the ability of users to identify
the correct placement of virtual anatomical structures in our screen-based AR
system for two conditions: a regular mirror and a non-reversing mirror setup.
The results of our study indicate that the latter is more suitable for
applications where previously acquired domain-specific knowledge plays an
important role. The lessons learned open up new research directions in the
fields of user interfaces and interaction in non-reversing mirror environments
and could impact the implementation of general screen-based AR systems in other
domains."
"Non-programming users should be able to create their own customized scripts
to perform computer-based tasks for them, just by demonstrating to the machine
how it's done. To that end, we develop a system prototype which
learns-by-demonstration called HILC (Help, It Looks Confusing). Users train
HILC to synthesize a task script by demonstrating the task, which produces the
needed screenshots and their corresponding mouse-keyboard signals. After the
demonstration, the user answers follow-up questions.
  We propose a user-in-the-loop framework that learns to generate scripts of
actions performed on visible elements of graphical applications. While pure
programming-by-demonstration is still unrealistic, we use quantitative and
qualitative experiments to show that non-programming users are willing and
effective at answering follow-up queries posed by our system. Our models of
events and appearance are surprisingly simple, but are combined effectively to
cope with varying amounts of supervision.
  The best available baseline, Sikuli Slides, struggled with the majority of
the tests in our user study experiments. The prototype with our proposed
approach successfully helped users accomplish simple linear tasks, complicated
tasks (monitoring, looping, and mixed), and tasks that span across multiple
executables. Even when both systems could ultimately perform a task, ours was
trained and refined by the user in less time."
"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) implement a direct communication pathway
between the brain of an user and an external device, as a computer or a machine
in general. One of the most used brain responses to implement non-invasive BCIs
is the so called steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). This periodic
response is generated when an user gazes to a light flickering at a constant
frequency. The SSVEP response can be detected in the user's
electroencephalogram (EEG) at the corresponding frequency of the attended
flickering stimulus. In SSVEP based BCIs, multiple stimuli, flickering at
different frequencies, are commonly presented to the user, where to each
stimulus is associated a command for an actuator. One of the limitations to a
wider adoption of BCIs is given by the need of EEG acquisition devices and
software tools which are commonly not meant for end-user usage. In this work,
exploiting state-of-the-art software tools, the use of a low cost easy to wear
single electrode EEG device is demonstrated to be exploitable to implement
simple SSVEP based BCIs. The obtained results, although less impressive than
the ones obtainable with professional EEG equipment, are interesting in view of
practical low cost BCI applications meant for end-users."
"We are experiencing an upcoming trend of using head mounted display systems
in games and serious games, which is likely to become an established practice
in the near future. While these systems provide highly immersive experiences,
many users have been reporting discomfort symptoms, such as nausea, sickness,
and headaches, among others. When using VR for health applications, this is
more critical, since the discomfort may interfere a lot in treatments. In this
work we discuss possible causes of these issues, and present possible solutions
as design guidelines that may mitigate them. In this context, we go deeper
within a dynamic focus solution to reduce discomfort in immersive virtual
environments, when using first-person navigation. This solution applies an
heuristic model of visual attention that works in real time. This work also
discusses a case study (as a first-person spatial shooter demo) that applies
this solution and the proposed design guidelines."
"A well-designed control-to-display (CD) gain function can improve pointing
performance with an indirect pointing device such as a trackpad. However, the
design of gain functions has been challenging and mostly based on trial and
error. AutoGain is an unobtrusive method to obtain a gain function for an
indirect pointing device in contexts where cursor trajectories can be tracked.
It gradually improves pointing efficiency by using a novel submovement-level
tracking+optimization technique. In a study, we show that AutoGain can produce
gain functions with performance comparable to commercial designs in less than a
half hour of active use. This is attributable to reductions in aiming error
(undershooting/overshooting) for each submovement. Our second study shows that
AutoGain can be used to obtain gain functions for emerging input devices (here,
a Leap Motion controller) for which no good gain function may exist yet.
Finally, we discuss deployment in a real interactive system."
"Objective. Covert aspects of ongoing user mental states provide key context
information for user-aware human computer interactions. In this paper, we focus
on the problem of estimating the vigilance of users using EEG and EOG signals.
Approach. To improve the feasibility and wearability of vigilance estimation
devices for real-world applications, we adopt a novel electrode placement for
forehead EOG and extract various eye movement features, which contain the
principal information of traditional EOG. We explore the effects of EEG from
different brain areas and combine EEG and forehead EOG to leverage their
complementary characteristics for vigilance estimation. Considering that the
vigilance of users is a dynamic changing process because the intrinsic mental
states of users involve temporal evolution, we introduce continuous conditional
neural field and continuous conditional random field models to capture dynamic
temporal dependency. Main results. We propose a multimodal approach to
estimating vigilance by combining EEG and forehead EOG and incorporating the
temporal dependency of vigilance into model training. The experimental results
demonstrate that modality fusion can improve the performance compared with a
single modality, EOG and EEG contain complementary information for vigilance
estimation, and the temporal dependency-based models can enhance the
performance of vigilance estimation. From the experimental results, we observe
that theta and alpha frequency activities are increased, while gamma frequency
activities are decreased in drowsy states in contrast to awake states.
Significance. The forehead setup allows for the simultaneous collection of EEG
and EOG and achieves comparative performance using only four shared electrodes
in comparison with the temporal and posterior sites."
"In this paper we measure the step-wise latency in the pipeline of three kinds
of interactive mobile video applications that are rapidly gaining popularity,
namely Remote Graphics Rendering (RGR) of which we focus on mobile cloud
gaming, Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), and Mobile Virtual Reality (MVR). The
applications differ from each other by the way in which the user interacts with
the application, i.e., video I/O and user controls, but they all share in
common the fact that their user experience is highly sensitive to end-to-end
latency. Long latency between a user control event and display update renders
the application unusable. Hence, understanding the nature and origins of
latency of these applications is of paramount importance. We show through
extensive measurements that control input and display buffering have a
substantial effect on the overall delay. Our results shed light on the latency
bottlenecks and the maturity of technology for seamless user experience with
these applications."
"Image CAPTCHA, aiming at effectively distinguishing human users from
malicious script attacks, has been an important mechanism to protect online
systems from spams and abuses. Despite the increasing interests in developing
and deploying image CAPTCHAs, the usability aspect of those CAPTCHAs has hardly
been explored systematically. In this paper, the universal design factors of
image CAPTCHAs, such as image layouts, quantities, sizes, tilting angles and
colors were experimentally evaluated through the following four dimensions:
eye-tracking, efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. The cognitive
processes revealed by eye-tracking indicate that the distribution of eye gaze
is equally assigned to each candidate image and irrelevant to the variation of
image contents. In addition, the gazing plot suggests that more than 70% of the
participants inspected CAPTCHA images row-by-row, which is more efficient than
scanning randomly. Those four-dimensional evaluations essentially suggest that
square and horizontal rectangle are the preferred layout; image quantities may
not exceed 16 while the image color is insignificant. Meanwhile, the image size
and tilting angle are suggested to be larger than 55 pixels x 55 pixels and
within -45~45 degrees, respectively. Basing on those usability experiment
results, we proposed a design guideline that is expected to be useful for
developing more usable image CAPTCHAs."
"Text CAPTCHA has been an effective means to protect online systems from spams
and abuses caused by automatic scripts which pretend to be human beings.
However, nearly all the Text CAPTCHA designs in nowadays are based on English
characters, which may not be the most user-friendly option for non-English
speakers. Therefore, under the background of globalization, there is an
increasing interest in designing local-language CAPTCHA, which is expected to
be more usable for native speakers. However, systematic studies on the
usability of localized CAPTCHAs are rare, and a general procedure for the
design of usable localized CAPTCHA is still unavailable. Here, we
comprehensively explored the design of CAPTCHAs based on Chinese characters
from a usability perspective: cognitive processes of solving alphanumeric and
Chinese CAPTCHAs are analyzed, followed by a usability comparison of those two
types of CAPTCHAs and the evaluation of intrinsic design factors of Chinese
CAPTCHAs. It was found that Chinese CAPTCHAs could be equally usable comparing
with alphanumeric ones. Meanwhile, guidelines for the design of usable Chinese
CAPTCHAs were also presented. Moreover, those design practices were also
summarized as a general procedure which is expected to be applicable for the
design of CAPTCHAs based on other languages."
"Social gaming is today a pervasive phenomenon. Driven by the advent of social
networks and the digitization of game distribution. In this paper the impact of
digitization and so-cial networks such as Facebook on digital games is
de-scribed and evaluated. This impact follows several vectors, including the
introduction of new game formats and extend-ing the traditional audiences for
games, which in turn has increased industrial revenue. The industry is in turn
shaped by new business model such as Free-to-Play, digital distri-bution and
the use of viral social features. These changes do not only appear
irreversible, but more importantly, play a part in shaping the future of
digital game design, notably for mobile devices. The paper presents new
knowledge from controlled live experiments from a casual social game across
Facebook and mobile platforms, finding positive re-turns by adding social
gameplay features. This suggests that not only social network games, but also
casual mobile games can benefit from deeper social gameplay mechanics. Given
the impact of social features on gameplay, Game An-alytics will need to evolve
to be able to handle requirements that arise from the introduction of social
features, e.g. how to measure engagement against social features and shaping
organic and viral spreading of a game."
"We report from the Do Not Disturb Challenge where 30 volunteers disabled
notification alerts for 24 hours across all devices. The effect of the absence
of notifications on the participants was isolated through an experimental study
design: we compared self-reported feedback from the day without notifications
against a baseline day. The evidence indicates that notifications have locked
us in a dilemma: without notifications, participants felt less distracted and
more productive. But, they also felt no longer able to be as responsive as
expected, which made some participants anxious. And, they felt less connected
with one's social group. In contrast to previous reports, about two third of
the participants expressed the intention to change how they manage
notifications. Two years later, half of the participants are still following
through with their plans."

"We present RFexpress! the first-ever network-edge based system to recognize
emotion from movement, gesture and pose via Device-Free Activity Recognition
(DFAR). With the proliferation of the IoT, also wireless access points are
deployed at increasingly dense scale. in particular, this includes vehicular
nodes (in-car WiFi or Bluetooth), office (Wlan APs, WiFi printer or projector)
and private indoor domains (home WiFi mesh, Wireless media access), as well as
public spaces (City/open WiFi, Cafes, shopping spaces). Processing
RF-fluctuation at such edge-devices, enables environmental perception. In this
paper, we focus on the distinction between neutral and agitated emotional
states of humans from RF-fluctuation at the wireless network edge in realistic
environments. In particular, the system is able to detect risky driving
behaviour in a vehicular setting as well as spotting angry conversations in an
indoor environment. We also study the effectiveness of edge-based DFAR emotion
and activity recognition systems in real environments such as cafes, malls,
outdoor and office spaces. We measure radio characteristics in these
environments at different days and times and analyse the impact of variations
in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of DFAR emotion and activity
recognition. In a case study with 5 subjects, we then exploit the limits of
edge-based DFAR by deriving critical SNR values under which activity and
emotion recognition results are no longer reliable. In case studies with 8 and
5 subjects the system further could achieve recognition accuracies of 82.9\%
and 64\% for vehicular and stationary wireless network edge in the wild
(non-laboratory noisy environments and non-scripted, natural individual
behaviour patterns)."
"Technology has become an essential part in every aspect of our lives. However
the key to a successful implementation of a technology depends on the
acceptance by the general public. In order to increase the acceptance various
approaches can be applied. In this paper, we will examine the human-robot
emotional interaction by investigating the capabilities of a developed
low-resolution RGB-LED display in the context of artificial emotions. We are
focusing on four of the most representative human emotions which include
happiness, anger, sadness and fear. We will work with colors and dynamic light
patterns which are supposed to evoke various associations. In an experiment,
the use these patterns as expressions of emotions are validated. The results of
the conducted study show that some of the considered basic emotions can be
recognized by human observers."
"The use of psychophysiologic signals in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of different
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Cardiovascular signals such as heart rate variability and blood pressure
variability are commonly used in psychophysiology in order to investigate
phenomena such as mental workload. In this paper we present a short review of
different cardiovascular metrics useful in the context of human-computer
interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We emphasise everyday
human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common
clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.

"People learn whenever and wherever possible, and whatever they like or
encounter--Mathematics, Drama, Art, Languages, Physics, Philosophy, and so on.
With the bursting of knowledge, evaluation of one's possession of knowledge
becomes increasingly difficult. There are a lot of demands to evaluate one's
understanding of a piece of knowledge. Assessment of understanding of knowledge
is conventionally through tests or interviews, but they have some limitations
such as low-efficiency and not-comprehensive. This paper proposes a method
called Understanding Tree to estimate one's understanding of knowledge, by
keeping track of his/her learning activities. It overcomes some limitations of
traditional methods, hence complements traditional methods."
"Despite the enormous interest in emotion classification from speech, the
impact of noise on emotion classification is not well understood. This is
important because, due to the tremendous advancement of the smartphone
technology, it can be a powerful medium for speech emotion recognition in the
outside laboratory natural environment, which is likely to incorporate
background noise in the speech. We capitalize on the current breakthrough of
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and seek to investigate its performance for
emotion classification from noisy speech. We particularly focus on the recently
proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is yet to be explored for emotion
recognition from speech. Experiments conducted with speech compounded with
eight different types of noises reveal that GRU incurs an 18.16% smaller
run-time while performing quite comparably to the Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), which is the most popular Recurrent Neural Network proposed to date.
This result is promising for any embedded platform in general and will initiate
further studies to utilize GRU to its full potential for emotion recognition on
smartphones."
"We present an end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system that generates
audio and synchronized tongue motion directly from text. This is achieved by
adapting a 3D model of the tongue surface to an articulatory dataset and
training a statistical parametric speech synthesis system directly on the
tongue model parameter weights. We evaluate the model at every step by
comparing the spatial coordinates of predicted articulatory movements against
the reference data. The results are encouraging, and our approach can be
adapted to add an articulatory modality to conventional TTS applications
without the need for extra data."
"This bachelor's thesis describes the conception and implementation of an
augmented reality application for the Android platform. The intention is to
demonstrate some possibilities of interaction within an augmented reality
environment on mobile devices. For that purpose, a 3D-model is displayed on the
devices' touchscreen using marker-based tracking. This enables the user to
translate, rotate or scale the model as he wishes. He can additionally select
and highlight preassigned parts of the model to display specific information
for that element. To assist developers in modifying the application for
changing requirements without re-writing large portions of the source code, the
information for each part have been encapsulated into its own data type. After
an introduction to augmented reality, its underlying technology and the Android
platform, some possible usage scenarios and the resulting functionalities are
outlined. Finally, the design as well as the developed implementation are
described."
"In this paper, we present CrowdTone, a system designed to help people set the
appropriate tone in their email communication. CrowdTone utilizes the context
and content of an email message to identify and set the appropriate tone
through a consensus-building process executed by crowd workers. We evaluated
CrowdTone with 22 participants, who provided a total of 29 emails that they had
received in the past, and ran them through CrowdTone. Participants and
professional writers assessed the quality of improvements finding a substantial
increase in the percentage of emails deemed ""appropriate"" or ""very appropriate""
- from 25% to more than 90% by recipients, and from 45% to 90% by professional
writers. Additionally, the recipients' feedback indicated that more than 90% of
the CrowdTone processed emails showed improvement."
"In this paper we describe and evaluate a mixed reality system that aims to
augment users in task guidance applications by combining automated and
unsupervised information collection with minimally invasive video guides. The
result is a self-contained system that we call GlaciAR (Glass-enabled
Contextual Interactions for Augmented Reality), that operates by extracting
contextual interactions from observing users performing actions. GlaciAR is
able to i) automatically determine moments of relevance based on a head motion
attention model, ii) automatically produce video guidance information, iii)
trigger these video guides based on an object detection method, iv) learn
without supervision from observing multiple users and v) operate fully on-board
a current eyewear computer (Google Glass). We describe the components of
GlaciAR together with evaluations on how users are able to use the system to
achieve three tasks. We see this work as a first step toward the development of
systems that aim to scale up the notoriously difficult authoring problem in
guidance systems and where people's natural abilities are enhanced via
minimally invasive visual guidance."
"Around-device interaction promises to extend the input space of mobile and
wearable devices beyond the common but restricted touchscreen. So far, most
around-device interaction approaches rely on instrumenting the device or the
environment with additional sensors. We believe, that the full potential of
ordinary cameras, specifically user-facing cameras, which are integrated in
most mobile devices today, are not used to their full potential, yet. We To
this end, we present a novel approach for extending the input space around
unmodified mobile devices using built-in front-facing cameras of unmodified
handheld devices. Our approach estimates hand poses and gestures through
reflections in sunglasses, ski goggles or visors. Thereby, GlassHands creates
an enlarged input space, rivaling input reach on large touch displays. We
discuss the idea, its limitations and future work."
"We present a method that automatically evaluates emotional response from
spontaneous facial activity recorded by a depth camera. The automatic
evaluation of emotional response, or affect, is a fascinating challenge with
many applications, including human-computer interaction, media tagging and
human affect prediction. Our approach in addressing this problem is based on
the inferred activity of facial muscles over time, as captured by a depth
camera recording an individual's facial activity. Our contribution is two-fold:
First, we constructed a database of publicly available short video clips, which
elicit a strong emotional response in a consistent manner across different
individuals. Each video was tagged by its characteristic emotional response
along 4 scales: \emph{Valence, Arousal, Likability} and \emph{Rewatch} (the
desire to watch again). The second contribution is a two-step prediction
method, based on learning, which was trained and tested using this database of
tagged video clips. Our method was able to successfully predict the
aforementioned 4 dimensional representation of affect, as well as to identify
the period of strongest emotional response in the viewing recordings, in a
method that is blind to the video clip being watch, revealing a significantly
high agreement between the recordings of independent viewers."
"Previous work in the area of gesture production, has made the assumption that
machines can replicate ""human-like"" gestures by connecting a bounded set of
salient points in the motion trajectory. Those inflection points were
hypothesized to also display cognitive saliency. The purpose of this paper is
to validate that claim using electroencephalography (EEG). That is, this paper
attempts to find neural signatures of gestures (also referred as placeholders)
in human cognition, which facilitate the understanding, learning and repetition
of gestures. Further, it is discussed whether there is a direct mapping between
the placeholders and kinematic salient points in the gesture trajectories.
These are expressed as relationships between inflection points in the gestures'
trajectories with oscillatory mu rhythms (8-12 Hz) in the EEG. This is achieved
by correlating fluctuations in mu power during gesture observation with salient
motion points found for each gesture. Peaks in the EEG signal at central
electrodes (motor cortex) and occipital electrodes (visual cortex) were used to
isolate the salient events within each gesture. We found that a linear model
predicting mu peaks from motion inflections fits the data well. Increases in
EEG power were detected 380 and 500ms after inflection points at occipital and
central electrodes, respectively. These results suggest that coordinated
activity in visual and motor cortices is sensitive to motion trajectories
during gesture observation, and it is consistent with the proposal that
inflection points operate as placeholders in gesture recognition."
"User's intentions may be expressed through spontaneous gesturing, which have
been seen only a few times or never before. Recognizing such gestures involves
one shot gesture learning. While most research has focused on the recognition
of the gestures itself, recently new approaches were proposed to deal with
gesture perception and production as part of the same problem. The framework
presented in this work focuses on learning the process that leads to gesture
generation, rather than mining the gesture's associated features. This is
achieved using kinematic, cognitive and biomechanic characteristics of human
interaction. These factors enable the artificial production of realistic
gesture samples originated from a single observation. The generated samples are
then used as training sets for different state-of-the-art classifiers.
Performance is obtained first, by observing the machines' gesture recognition
percentages. Then, performance is computed by the human recognition from
gestures performed by robots. Based on these two scenarios, a composite new
metric of coherency is proposed relating to the amount of agreement between
these two conditions. Experimental results provide an average recognition
performance of 89.2% for the trained classifiers and 92.5% for the
participants. Coherency in recognition was determined at 93.6%. While this new
metric is not directly comparable to raw accuracy or other pure
performance-based standard metrics, it provides a quantifier for validating how
realistic the machine generated samples are and how accurate the resulting
mimicry is."
"We conduct an experimental analysis of a dataset comprising over 27 million
microtasks performed by over 70,000 workers issued to a large crowdsourcing
marketplace between 2012-2016. Using this data---never before analyzed in an
academic context---we shed light on three crucial aspects of crowdsourcing: (1)
Task design --- helping requesters understand what constitutes an effective
task, and how to go about designing one; (2) Marketplace dynamics --- helping
marketplace administrators and designers understand the interaction between
tasks and workers, and the corresponding marketplace load; and (3) Worker
behavior --- understanding worker attention spans, lifetimes, and general
behavior, for the improvement of the crowdsourcing ecosystem as a whole."
"The emotional response a person has to a living space is predominantly
affected by light, color and texture as space-making elements. In order to
verify whether this phenomenon could be replicated in a simulated environment,
we conducted a user study in a six-sided projected immersive display that
utilized equivalent design attributes of brightness, color and texture in order
to assess to which extent the emotional response in a simulated environment is
affected by the same parameters affecting real environments. Since emotional
response depends upon the context, we evaluated the emotional responses of two
groups of users: inactive (passive) and active (performing a typical daily
activity). The results from the perceptual study generated data from which
design principles for a virtual living space are articulated. Such a space, as
an alternative to expensive built dwellings, could potentially support new,
minimalist lifestyles of occupants, defined as the neo-nomads, aligned with
their work experience in the digital domain through the generation of emotional
experiences of spaces. Data from the experiments confirmed the hypothesis that
perceivable emotional aspects of real-world spaces could be successfully
generated through simulation of design attributes in the virtual space. The
subjective response to the virtual space was consistent with corresponding
responses from real-world color and brightness emotional perception. Our data
could serve the virtual reality (VR) community in its attempt to conceive of
further applications of virtual spaces for well-defined activities."
"Modern social media relies on high quality user generated writing such as
reviews, explanations, and answers. In contrast to standard validation to
provide feedback for structured inputs (e.g., dates, email addresses), it is
difficult to provide timely, high quality, customized feedback for free-form
text input. While existing solutions based on crowdsourced feedback (e.g.,
up-votes and comments) can eventually produce high quality feedback, they
suffer from high latency and costs, whereas fully automated approaches are
limited to syntactic feedback that does not address text content. We introduce
Dialectic, an end-to-end extensible system that simplifies the process of
creating, customizing, and deploying content-specific feedback for free-text
inputs. Our main observation is that many services already have a corpus of
crowdsourced feedback that can be used to bootstrap a feedback system.
Dialectic initializes with a corpus of annotated free-form text, automatically
segments input text, and helps developers rapidly add domain-specific document
quality features as well as content-specific feedback generation functions to
provide targeted feedback to user inputs. Our user study shows that Dialectic
can be used to create a feedback interface that produces an average of 14.4\%
quality improvement of product review text, over 3x better than a
state-of-the-art feedback system."
"The wide spread of mobile devices in the consumer market has posed a number
of new issues in the design of internet applications and their user interfaces.
In particular, applications need to adapt their interaction modalities to
different portable devices. In this paper we address the problem of defining
models and techniques for designing internet based applications that
automatically adapt to different mobile devices. First, we define a formal
model that allows for specifying the interaction in a way that is abstract
enough to be decoupled from the presentation layer, which is to be adapted to
different contexts. The model is mainly based on the idea of describing the
user interaction in terms of elementary actions. Then, we provide a formal
device characterization showing how to effectively implements the AIUs in a
multidevice context."
"This chapter describes a semantic dialogue system for radiologists in a
comprehensive case study within the large-scale MEDICO project. MEDICO
addresses the need for advanced semantic technologies in the search for medical
image and patient data. The objectives are, first, to enable a seamless
integration of medical images and different user applications by providing
direct access to image semantics, and second, to design and implement a
multimodal dialogue shell for the radiologist. Speech-based semantic image
retrieval and annotation of medical images should provide the basis for help in
clinical decision support and computer aided diagnosis. We will describe the
clinical workflow and interaction requirements and focus on the design and
implementation of a multimodal user interface for patient/image search or
annotation and its implementation while using a speech-based dialogue shell.
Ontology modeling provides the backbone for knowledge representation in the
dialogue shell and the specific medical application domain; ontology structures
are the communication basis of our combined semantic search and retrieval
architecture which includes the MEDICO server, the triple store, the semantic
search API, the medical visualization toolkit MITK, and the speech-based
dialogue shell, amongst others. We will focus on usability aspects of
multimodal applications, our storyboard and the implemented speech and
touchscreen interaction design."
"We propose a new approach for interaction in Virtual Reality (VR) using
mobile robots as proxies for haptic feedback. This approach allows VR users to
have the experience of sharing and manipulating tangible physical objects with
remote collaborators. Because participants do not directly observe the robotic
proxies, the mapping between them and the virtual objects is not required to be
direct. In this paper, we describe our implementation, various scenarios for
interaction, and a preliminary user study."
"StreamBED is an embodied VR training for citizen scientists to make
qualitative stream assessments. Early findings garnered positive feedback about
training qualitative assessment using a virtual representation of different
stream spaces, but presented field-specific challenges; novice biologists had
trouble interpreting qualitative protocols, and needed substantive guidance to
look for and interpret environment cues. In order to address these issues in
the redesign, this work uses research through design (RTD) methods to consider
feedback from expert stream biologists, firsthand stream monitoring experience,
discussions with education and game designers, and feedback from a low fidelity
prototype. The qualitative findings found that training should facilitate
personal narratives, maximize realism, and should use social dynamics to
scaffold learning."
"IUIs aim to incorporate intelligent automated capabilities in human computer
interaction, where the net impact is a human-computer interaction that improves
performance or usability in critical ways. It also involves designing and
implementing an artificial intelligence (AI) component that effectively
leverages human skills and capabilities, so that human performance with an
application excels. IUIs embody capabilities that have traditionally been
associated more strongly with humans than with computers: how to perceive,
interpret, learn, use language, reason, plan, and decide."
"Live interactions have the potential to meaningfully engage audiences during
musical performances, and modern technologies promise unique ways to facilitate
these interactions. This work presents findings from three co-design sessions
with children that investigated how audiences might want to interact with live
music performances, including design considerations and opportunities. Findings
from these sessions also formed a Spectrum of Audience Interactivity in live
musical performances, outlining ways to encourage interactivity in music
performances from the child perspective."
"Bias is a common problem in today's media, appearing frequently in text and
in visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better
methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists --those who are motivated
to effect change related to some topic, need better methods to identify and
counteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases
in mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that
supports identification of, and action on bias in visual news media. In
particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of
bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling
activists to inform the public of bias and take action by engaging people in
conversation with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform
that explores the impressions that activists had of our tool, and how people
reacted and engaged with online bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by
discussing design and implication of our findings for creating future systems
to identify and counteract the effects of news bias."
"We are working on a scalable, interactive visualization system, called
Carina, for people to explore million-node graphs. By using latest web browser
technologies, Carina offers fast graph rendering via WebGL, and works across
desktop (via Electron) and mobile platforms. Different from most existing graph
visualization tools, Carina does not store the full graph in RAM, enabling it
to work with graphs with up to 69M edges. We are working to improve and
open-source Carina, to offer researchers and practitioners a new, scalable way
to explore and visualize large graph datasets."
"Many data mining approaches aim at modelling and predicting human behaviour.
An important quantity of interest is the quality of model-based predictions,
e.g. for finding a competition winner with best prediction performance.
  In real life, human beings meet their decisions with considerable
uncertainty. Its assessment and resulting implications for statistically
evident evaluation of predictive models are in the main focus of this
contribution. We identify relevant sources of uncertainty as well as the
limited ability of its accurate measurement, propose an uncertainty-aware
methodology for more evident evaluations of data mining approaches, and discuss
its implications for existing quality assessment strategies. Specifically, our
approach switches from common point-paradigm to more appropriate
distribution-paradigm.
  This is exemplified in the context of recommender systems and their
established metrics of prediction quality. The discussion is substantiated by
comprehensive experiments with real users, large-scale simulations, and
discussion of prior evaluation campaigns (i.a. Netflix Prize) in the light of
human uncertainty aspects."
"Efficient human-machine networks require productive interaction between human
and machine actors. In this study, we address how a strengthening of machine
agency, for example through increasing levels of automation, affect the human
actors of the networks. Findings from case studies within air traffic
management, crisis management, and crowd evacuation are presented, exemplifying
how automation may strengthen the agency of human actors in the network through
responsibility sharing and task allocation, and serve as a needed prerequisite
of innovation and change."
"Theories of knowledge reuse posit two distinct processes: reuse for
replication and reuse for innovation. We identify another distinct process,
reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process in which
designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce models that
fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse for customization
in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares files for
three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more often than the 3D
models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is amplified when the metamodels
are created by designers with greater community experience. Metamodels make the
community's design knowledge available for reuse for customization-or further
extension of the metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation."
"In many areas of data mining, data is collected from humans beings. In this
contribution, we ask the question of how people actually respond to ordinal
scales. The main problem observed is that users tend to be volatile in their
choices, i.e. complex cognitions do not always lead to the same decisions, but
to distributions of possible decision outputs. This human uncertainty may
sometimes have quite an impact on common data mining approaches and thus, the
question of effective modelling this so called human uncertainty emerges
naturally.
  Our contribution introduces two different approaches for modelling the human
uncertainty of user responses. In doing so, we develop techniques in order to
measure this uncertainty at the level of user inputs as well as the level of
user cognition. With support of comprehensive user experiments and large-scale
simulations, we systematically compare both methodologies along with their
implications for personalisation approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
significant amounts of users do submit something completely different (action)
than they really have in mind (cognition). Moreover, we demonstrate that
statistically sound evidence with respect to algorithm assessment becomes quite
hard to realise, especially when explicit rankings shall be built."
"Human-machine systems required a deep understanding of human behaviors. Most
existing research on action recognition has focused on discriminating between
different actions, however, the quality of executing an action has received
little attention thus far. In this paper, we study the quality assessment of
driving behaviors and present WiQ, a system to assess the quality of actions
based on radio signals. This system includes three key components, a deep
neural network based learning engine to extract the quality information from
the changes of signal strength, a gradient based method to detect the signal
boundary for an individual action, and an activitybased fusion policy to
improve the recognition performance in a noisy environment. By using the
quality information, WiQ can differentiate a triple body status with an
accuracy of 97%, while for identification among 15 drivers, the average
accuracy is 88%. Our results show that, via dedicated analysis of radio
signals, a fine-grained action characterization can be achieved, which can
facilitate a large variety of applications, such as smart driving assistants."
"Rapport plays an important role during communication because it can help
people understand each other's feelings or ideas and leads to a smooth
communication. Computational rapport model has been proposed based on theory in
previous work. But there lacks solid verification. In this paper, we apply
structural equation model (SEM) to the theoretical model on both dyads of
friend and stranger. The results indicate some unfavorable paths. Based on the
results and more literature, we modify the original model to integrate more
nonverbal behaviors, including gaze and smile. Fit indices and other
examination show the goodness of our new models, which can give us more insight
into rapport management during conversation."
"Human computation games (HCGs) can provide novel solutions to intractable
computational problems, help enable scientific breakthroughs, and provide
datasets for artificial intelligence. However, our knowledge about how to
design and deploy HCGs that appeal to players and solve problems effectively is
incomplete. We present an investigatory HCG based on Super Mario Bros. We used
this game in a human subjects study to investigate how different social
conditions---singleplayer and multiplayer---and scoring
mechanics---collaborative and competitive---affect players' subjective
experiences, accuracy at the task, and the completion rate. In doing so, we
demonstrate a novel design approach for HCGs, and discuss the benefits and
tradeoffs of these mechanics in HCG design."
"Every teacher understands that different students benefit from different
activities. Recent advances in data processing allow us to detect and use
behavioral variability for adapting to a student. This approach allows us to
optimize learning process but does not focus on understanding it. Conversely,
classical findings in educational sciences allow us to understand the learner
but are hard to embed in a large scale adaptive system. In this study we design
and build a framework to investigate when the two approaches coincide."
"In the Google Play store, an introduction page is associated with every
mobile application (app) for users to acquire its details, including
screenshots, description, reviews, etc. However, it remains a challenge to
identify what items influence users most when downloading an app. To explore
users' perspective, we conduct a survey to inquire about this question. The
results of survey suggest that the participants pay most attention to the app
description which gives users a quick overview of the app. Although there exist
some guidelines about how to write a good app description to attract more
downloads, it is hard to define a high quality app description. Meanwhile,
there is no tool to evaluate the quality of app description. In this paper, we
employ the method of crowdsourcing to extract the attributes that affect the
app descriptions' quality. First, we download some app descriptions from Google
Play, then invite some participants to rate their quality with the score from
one (very poor) to five (very good). The participants are also requested to
explain every score's reasons. By analyzing the reasons, we extract the
attributes that the participants consider important during evaluating the
quality of app descriptions. Finally, we train the supervised learning models
on a sample of 100 app descriptions. In our experiments, the support vector
machine model obtains up to 62% accuracy. In addition, we find that the
permission, the number of paragraphs and the average number of words in one
feature play key roles in defining a good app description."
"Teegi is an anthropomorphic and tangible avatar exposing a users' brain
activity in real time. It is connected to a device sensing the brain by means
of electroencephalog-raphy (EEG). Teegi moves its hands and feet and closes its
eyes along with the person being monitored. It also displays on its scalp the
associated EEG signals, thanks to a semi-spherical display made of LEDs.
Attendees can interact directly with Teegi -- e.g. move its limbs -- to
discover by themselves the underlying brain processes. Teegi can be used for
scientific outreach to introduce neurotechnologies in general and
brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in particular."
"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) offer individuals suffering from major
disabilities an alternative method to interact with their environment.
Sensorimotor rhythm (SMRs) based BCIs can successfully perform control tasks;
however, the traditional SMR paradigms intuitively disconnect the control and
real task, making them non-ideal for complex control scenarios. In this study,
we design a new, intuitively connected motor imagery (MI) paradigm using
hierarchical common spatial patterns (HCSP) and context information to
effectively predict intended hand grasps from electroencephalogram (EEG) data.
Experiments with 5 participants yielded an aggregate classification
accuracy--intended grasp prediction probability--of 64.5\% for 8 different hand
gestures, more than 5 times the chance level."
"Noninvasive brain computer interfaces (BCI), and more specifically
Electroencephalography (EEG) based systems for intent detection need to
compensate for the low signal to noise ratio of EEG signals. In many
applications, the temporal dependency information from consecutive decisions
and contextual data can be used to provide a prior probability for the upcoming
decision. In this study we proposed two probabilistic graphical models (PGMs),
using context information and previously observed EEG evidences to estimate a
probability distribution over the decision space in graph based decision-making
mechanism. In this approach, user moves a pointer to the desired vertex in the
graph in which each vertex represents an action. To select a vertex, a Select
command, or a proposed probabilistic Selection criterion (PSC) can be used to
automatically detect the user intended vertex. Performance of different PGMs
and Selection criteria combinations are compared over a keyboard based on a
graph layout. Based on the simulation results, probabilistic Selection
criterion along with the probabilistic graphical model provides the highest
performance boost for individuals with pour calibration performance and
achieving the same performance for individuals with high calibration
performance."
"We describe a case study with the participation of a Danish veteran suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As part of psychotherapeutic
treatment the participant and therapist have used our novel technique for
instrumenting self-tracking of select aspects of subjective experience using a
one-button wearable device. The instrumentation system is described along with
the specific self-track- ing protocol which defined the participant's
self-tracking of a single symptom, namely the occurrences of a bodily
experienced precursor to hyperarousal. Results from the case study demonstrate
how self-tracking data on a single symptom collected by a patient can provide
valuable input to the therapeutic process. Specifically, it facilitated
identification of crucial details otherwise unavailable from the clinical
assessment and even became decisive in disentangling different symptoms and
their causes."
"Location sensing is a key enabling technology for Ubicomp to support
contextual interaction. However, the laboratories where calibrated testing of
location technologies is done are very different to the domestic situations
where `context' is a problematic social construct. This study reports
measurements of Bluetooth beacons, informed by laboratory studies, but done in
diverse domestic settings. The design of these surveys has been motivated by
the natural environment implied in the Bluetooth beacon standards - relating
the technical environment of the beacon to the function of spaces within the
home. This research method can be considered as a situated, `ethnographic'
technical response to the study of physical infrastructure that arises through
social processes. The results offer insights for the future design of `seamful'
approaches to indoor location sensing, and to the ways that context might be
constructed and interpreted in a seamful manner."
"As virtual reality (VR) emerges as a mainstream platform, designers have
started to experiment new interaction techniques to enhance the user
experience. This is a challenging task because designers not only strive to
provide designs with good performance but also carefully ensure not to disrupt
users' immersive experience. There is a dire need for a new evaluation tool
that extends beyond traditional quantitative measurements to assist designers
in the design process. We propose an EEG-based experiment framework that
evaluates interaction techniques in VR by measuring intentionally elicited
cognitive conflict. Through the analysis of the feedback-related negativity
(FRN) as well as other quantitative measurements, this framework allows
designers to evaluate the effect of the variables of interest. We studied the
framework by applying it to the fundamental task of 3D object selection using
direct 3D input, i.e. tracked hand in VR. The cognitive conflict is
intentionally elicited by manipulating the selection radius of the target
object. Our first behavior experiment validated the framework in line with the
findings of conflict-induced behavior adjustments like those reported in other
classical psychology experiment paradigms. Our second EEG-based experiment
examines the effect of the appearance of virtual hands. We found that the
amplitude of FRN correlates with the level of realism of the virtual hands,
which concurs with the Uncanny Valley theory."
"Designing and building automated systems with which people can interact
naturally is one of the emerging objective of Mechatronics. In this perspective
multimodality and adaptivity represent focal issues, enabling users to
communicate more freely and naturally with automated systems. One of the basic
problem of multimodal interaction is the fusion process. Current approaches to
fusion are mainly two: the former implements the multimodal fusion at dialogue
management level, whereas the latter at grammar level. In this paper, we
propose a multimodal attribute grammar, that provides constructions both for
representing input symbols from different modalities and for modeling semantic
and temporal features of multimodal input symbols, enabling the specification
of multimodal languages. Moreover, an application of the proposed approach in
the context of a multimodal language specification to control a driver
assistance system, as robots using different integrated interaction modalities,
is given."
"A holographic display system is able to offer an immersive 3D experience with
a controllable focus cue that matches the depth information of virtual content.
Proper calibration of an OST-HMD must take into account the specific features
of that HMD. Existing calibration methods, however, cannot fully capture the
optical characteristics of holographic display systems. With the aid of
tracking systems, it is possible to register rendered graphics with tracked
objects in the real world, providing an augmented reality experience for the
users. We propose a new calibration procedure to properly align the coordinate
system of rendering with that of the tracker. In this paper, both internal and
external tracking systems are studied; three models of the mapping from
tracking space to display space are presented: isometric, affine and
perspective transformation. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of
our method. Additionally, in a novel approach, the implementation uses self
localization and spatial mapping of the HMD with an external tracker to perform
this calibration, eliminating the requirement for line of sight from the HMD to
the object or tracker. Microsoft HoloLens is used as the holographic OST-HMD
for our experiments. The experimental results indicate an accuracy of up to 4
mm in the average reprojection error for the general perspective case and
similarly 4 mm in our objective evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first OST-HMD calibration method that takes the holographic nature of
the display technology into account."
"The distinct abilities of older adults to interact with computers has
motivated a wide range of contributions in the the form of design guidelines
for making technologies usable and accessible for the elderly population.
However, despite the growing effort by the research community, the adoption of
guidelines by developers and designers has been scant or not properly
translated into more accessible interaction systems. In this paper we explore
this issue by reporting on a qualitative outcomes of a systematic review of 204
research-derived design guidelines for touchscreen applications. We report
first on the different definitions of ""elderly"" and assess the reliability,
organization and accessibility of the guidelines. Then we present our early
attempt at facilitating the reporting and access of such guidelines to
researchers and practitioners."
"This dissertation presents three years of academic inquiry into the question
of what role materials play in interaction design and participatory design
processes. The dissertation aims at developing conceptual tools, based on
Deweys pragmatism, for understanding how materials aid design reflection.
  It has been developed using a research-through-design approach in which the
author has conducted practical design work in order to investigate and
experiment with using materials to scaffold design inquiry. The results of the
PhD work is submitted as seven separate papers, submitted to esteemed journals
and conferences within the field of interaction design and HCI.
  The work is motivated both by the growing interest in materials in
interaction design and HCI and the interest in design processes and
collaboration within those fields. At the core of the dissertation lies an
interest in the many different materials used during the design process:
sketches, prototypes as well as the materials we shape products out of:
physical and digital materials now form a unity of computation and physical
materials that has given rise to a new research interest in design and
materiality.
  The main results from the dissertation are an understanding of design
materials that draws on pragmatist philosophy. The papers and overview article
highlights how materials in a pragmatist perspective are more than the matter
out of which we shape an idea. Rather they structure the entire process of
inquiry, helping us frame problems, inspire solutions and try out these
solutions in practice. This framework, developed in several of the submitted
papers, is tested and illustrated through a series of experimental design
cases."
"Music history, referring to the records of users' listening or downloading
history in online music services, is the primary source for music service
providers to analyze users' preferences on music and thus to provide
personalized recommendations to users. In order to engage users into the
service and to improve user experience, it would be beneficial to provide
visual analyses of one user's music history as well as visualized
recommendations to that user. In this paper, we take a user-centric approach to
the design of such visual analyses. We start by investigating user needs on
such visual analyses and recommendations, then propose several different
visualization schemes, and perform a pilot study to collect user feedback on
the designed schemes. We further conduct user studies to verify the utility of
the proposed schemes, and the results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed visualization, but also provide important insights to guide the
visualization design in the future."
"The last two decades have seen the emergence and steady development of
tangible user interfaces. While most of these interfaces are applied for input
- with output still on traditional computer screens - the goal of programmable
matter and actuated shape-changing materials is to directly use the physical
objects for visual or tangible feedback. Advances in material sciences and
flexible display technologies are investigated to enable such reconfigurable
physical objects. While existing solutions aim for making physical objects more
controllable via the digital world, we propose an approach where holograms
(virtual objects) in a mixed reality environment are augmented with physical
variables such as shape, texture or temperature. As such, the support for
mobility forms an important contribution of the proposed solution since it
enables users to freely move within and across environments. Furthermore, our
augmented virtual objects can co-exist in a single environment with
programmable matter and other actuated shape-changing solutions. The future
potential of the proposed approach is illustrated in two usage scenarios and we
hope that the presentation of our work in progress on a novel way to realise
tangible holograms will foster some lively discussions in the CHI community."
"Recently, researchers started using cognitive load in various settings, e.g.,
educational psychology, cognitive load theory, or human-computer interaction.
Cognitive load characterizes a tasks' demand on the limited information
processing capacity of the brain. The widespread adoption of eye-tracking
devices led to increased attention for objectively measuring cognitive load via
pupil dilation. However, this approach requires a standardized data processing
routine to reliably measure cognitive load. This technical report presents
CEP-Web, an open source platform to providing state of the art data processing
routines for cleaning pupillary data combined with a graphical user interface,
enabling the management of studies and subjects. Future developments will
include the support for analyzing the cleaned data as well as support for
Task-Evoked Pupillary Response (TEPR) studies."
"The Web is becoming more and more a wide software framework on which each one
can compose and use contents, software applications and services. It can offer
adequate computational resources to manage the complexity implied by the use of
the five senses when involved in human machine interaction. The core of the
paper describes how SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) can support multimodal
interaction by pushing the I/O processing and reasoning to the cloud, improving
naturalness. The benefits of cloud computing for multimodal interaction have
been identified by emphasizing the flexibility and scalability of a SOA, and
its characteristics to provide a more holistic view of interaction according to
the variety of situations and users."
"Developments in information and communication technologies have been greatly
influential on the practices in all fields, and education is not an exception
to this. To illustrate with, computers were first used in computer assisted
education in order to increase the efficiency of teaching process. Recently,
computer has contributed more to the field through interactive and smart class
applications that are specially designed for classroom use. The aim of this
study is to develop a low cost, portable and projection supported touchscreen
to be used in educational environments by using FPGA technology and to test its
usability. For the purposes of the study, the above mentioned system was
developed by using the necessary hardware and software, and later it was tested
in terms of usability. This usability test was administered to teachers, who
were the target end users of this touchscreen writing / drawing system. The aim
of this test was to determine user friendliness, subservientness and usability
of the system. Several tools were used to obtain data from the users that
participated in the study. The analysis and evaluation of the data collected
revealed that the system has achieved its objectives successfully."
"We explore how the availability of a sensemaking tool influences users'
knowledge externalization strategies. On a large display, users were asked to
solve an intelligence analysis task with or without a bidirectionally linked
concept-graph (BLC) to organize insights into concepts (nodes) and relations
(edges). In BLC, both nodes and edges maintain ""deep links"" to the exact source
phrases and sections in associated documents. In our control condition, we were
able to reproduce previously described spatial organization behaviors using
document windows on the large display. When using BLC, however, we found that
analysts apply spatial organization to BLC nodes instead, use significantly
less display space and have significantly fewer open windows."
"In order to avoid the ""Midas Touch"" problem, gaze-based interfaces for
selection often introduce a dwell time: a fixed amount of time the user must
fixate upon an object before it is selected. Past interfaces have used a
uniform dwell time across all objects. Here, we propose an algorithm for
adjusting the dwell times of different objects based on the inferred
probability that the user wishes to select them. In particular, we introduce a
probabilistic model of gaze behavior and train it on natural gaze trajectories
collected while users surf the web through a gaze-based web browser. Using this
model, we can infer the probability that each hyperlink on the web page is the
one the user intends to select. We assign shorter dwell times to more likely
hyperlinks and longer dwell times to less likely hyperlinks. The resulting
variable dwell time gaze-based browser enables subjects to surf the web faster
and/or more reliably. We use a two-stage hidden Markov model based algorithm to
model the natural eye gaze trajectories. We have evaluated this method
objectively both in simulation and experimentally, and subjectively through
questionnaires. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a
better tradeoff between accuracy and speed. This work demonstrates that natural
eye movements can be used to infer user intent, and that this information can
be used to improve gaze-based selection without increased cognitive load on
users."
"Curiosity is a vital metacognitive skill in educational contexts. Yet, little
is known about how social factors influence curiosity in group work. We argue
that curiosity is evoked not only through individual, but also interpersonal
activities, and present what we believe to be the first theoretical framework
that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive account of curiosity based on
literature spanning psychology, learning sciences and group dynamics, along
with empirical observation of small-group science activity in an informal
learning environment. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and
interpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors
that fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging
a longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm positive
predictive relationship of the latent variables of individual and interpersonal
functions on curiosity, with the interpersonal functions exercising a
comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral realizations of these
functions are also discovered in a data-driven way. This framework is a step
towards designing learning technologies that can recognize and evoke curiosity
during learning in social contexts."
"This paper presents a description and evaluation of the ROC Speak system, a
platform that allows ubiquitous access to communication skills training. ROC
Speak (available at rocspeak.com) enables anyone to go to a website, record a
video, and receive feedback on smile intensity, body movement, volume
modulation, filler word usage, unique word usage, word cloud of the spoken
words, in addition to overall assessment and subjective comments by peers. Peer
comments are automatically ranked and sorted for usefulness and sentiment
(i.e., positive vs. negative). We evaluated the system with a diverse group of
56 online participants for a 10-day period. Participants submitted responses to
career oriented prompts every other day. The participants were randomly split
into two groups: 1) treatment - full feedback from the ROC Speak system; 2)
control - written feedback from online peers. When judged by peers (p<.001) and
independent raters (p<.05), participants from the treatment group demonstrated
statistically significant improvement in overall speaking skills rating while
the control group did not. Furthermore, in terms of speaking attributes,
treatment group showed an improvement in friendliness (p<.001), vocal variety
(p<.05) and articulation (p<.01)."
"Using Low Cost Portable Eye Tracking for Biometric Identification Or
Verification: Eye tracking technologies have in recent years become available
outside of specialised labs, and are starting to become integrated in tablets
and virtual reality headsets. This offers new opportunities for use in common
office- and home environments, such as for biometric recognition
(identification or verification), alone or in combination with other
technologies. This paper exposes two fundamentally different approaches that
have been suggested, based on spatial and temporal signatures respectively.
While deploying different stimulation paradigms for recording, it also proposes
an alternative way to analyze spatial domain signatures using Fourier
transformation. Empirical data recorded from two subjects over two weeks, three
months apart, are found to support previous results. Further, variations and
stability of some of the proposed signatures are analyzed over the extended
timeframe and under slightly varying conditions."
"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable, often disabling disease that can
adversely affect any body function; this often requires persons with MS to be
active patients who are able to self-manage. There are currently thousands of
health applications available but it is unknown how many concern MS. We
conducted a systematic review of all MS apps present in the most popular app
stores (iTunes and Google Play store) on June 2016 to identify all relevant MS
apps. After discarding non-MS related apps and duplicates, only a total of 25
MS apps were identified. App description contents and features were explored to
assess target audience, functionalities, and developing entities. The vast
majority of apps were focused on disease and treatment information with disease
management being a close second. This is the first study that reviews MS apps
and it highlights an interesting gap in the current repertoire of MS mHealth
resources."
"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women both in developed and
developing countries. More than half of all cancer mobile application concern
breast cancer. Gamification is widely used in mobile software applications
created for health-related services. Current prevalence of gamification in
breast cancer apps is unknown and detection must be manually performed. The
purpose of this study is to describe and produce a tool allowing automatic
detection of apps which contain gamification elements and thus empowering
researchers to study gamification using large data samples. Predictive logistic
regression model was designed on data extracted from breast cancer apps' title
and description text available in app stores. Model was validated comparing
estimated and benchmark values, observed by gamification specialists. Study's
outcome can be applied as a screening tool to efficiently identify gamification
presence in breast cancer apps for further research."
"We propose to fuse two currently separate research lines on novel therapies
for stroke rehabilitation: brain-computer interface (BCI) training and
transcranial electrical stimulation (TES). Specifically, we show that BCI
technology can be used to learn personalized decoding models that relate the
global configuration of brain rhythms in individual subjects (as measured by
EEG) to their motor performance during 3D reaching movements. We demonstrate
that our models capture substantial across-subject heterogeneity, and argue
that this heterogeneity is a likely cause of limited effect sizes observed in
TES for enhancing motor performance. We conclude by discussing how our
personalized models can be used to derive optimal TES parameters, e.g.,
stimulation site and frequency, for individual patients."
"Obesity is one of the major health risk factors be- hind the rise of
non-communicable conditions. Understanding the factors influencing obesity is
very complex since there are many variables that can affect the health
behaviors leading to it. Nowadays, multiple data sources can be used to study
health behaviors, such as wearable sensors for physical activity and sleep,
social media, mobile and health data. In this paper we describe the design of a
dashboard for the visualization of actigraphy and biometric data from a
childhood obesity camp in Qatar. This dashboard allows quantitative discoveries
that can be used to guide patient behavior and orient qualitative research."
"The author considers a class of mechatronic puzzles falling in the
mixed-reality category, present examples of such devices, and propose a way to
categorize them. Close relationships of such devices with the Tangible User
Interface are described. The device designed by the author as an illustration
of a mixed reality puzzle is presented."
"Computer-based simulation training (CBST) is gaining popularity in a vast
range of applications such as surgery, rehabilitation therapy, military
applications, and driver/pilot training, as it offers a low-cost,
easily-accessible and effective training environment. Typically, CBST systems
comprise of two essential components: 1) a simulation environment that provides
an immersive and interactive learning experience, and 2) a feedback
intervention system that supports knowledge/skill acquisition and decision
making. The simulation environment is created using technologies such as
virtual or augmented reality, and this is an area which has gained much
interest in recent years. The provision of automated feedback in CBST however,
has not been investigated as much, and thus, is the focus of this paper.
Feedback is an essential component in learning, and should be provided to the
trainee during the training process in order to improve skills, to correct
mistakes, and most importantly, to inspire reasoning and critical thinking. In
CBST, feedback should be provided in a useful and timely manner, ideally in a
way that mimics the advice of an experienced tutor. Here, we explore the
provision of feedback in CBST from three perspectives: 1) types of feedback to
be provided, 2) presentation modalities of feedback, and 3) methods for
feedback extraction/learning. This review is aimed at providing insight into
how feedback is extracted, organized, and delivered in current applications, to
be used as a guide to the development of future feedback intervention systems
in CBST applications."
"Multidimensional scaling allows visualizing high-dimensional data as 2D maps
with the premise that insights in 2D reveal valid information in
high-dimensions. However, the resulting projections suffer from artifacts such
as bad local neighborhood preservation and clusters tearing. Interactively
coloring the projection according to the discrepancy between original
proximities relative to a reference item reveals these artifacts, but it is not
clear if conveying these proximities using color and displaying only local
information really helps the visual analysis of projections. We conducted a
controlled experiment to investigate the relevance of this interactive
technique to help the visual analysis of any projection regardless its quality.
We compared the bare projection to the interactive coloring of the original
proximities on different visual analysis tasks involving outliers and clusters.
Results indicate that the interactive coloring is worthwhile for local tasks as
it is significantly robust to projection artifacts whereas the projection is
not. However this interactive technique does not help significantly for visual
clustering tasks for that projections already give a suitable overview."
"Emojis have gained incredible popularity in recent years and become a new
ubiquitous language for Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) by worldwide
users. Various research efforts have been made to understand the behaviors of
using emojis. Gender-specific study is always meaningful for HCI community,
however, so far we know very little about whether and how much males and
females vary in emoji usage. To bridge such a knowledge gap, this paper makes
the first effort to explore the emoji usage through a gender lens. Our analysis
is based on the largest data set to date, which covers 134,419 users from 183
countries, along with their over 401 million messages collected in three
months. We conduct a multi-dimensional statistical analysis from various
aspects of emoji usage, including the frequency, preferences, input patterns,
public/private CMC-scenario patterns, temporal patterns, and sentiment
patterns. The results demonstrate that emoji usage can significantly vary
between males and females. Accordingly, we propose some implications that can
raise useful insights to HCI community."
"Networked teleoperation with haptic feedback is a prime example for the
emerging Tactile Internet, which requires a careful orchestration of haptic
communication and control. One major challenge in this context is how to
maximize the user's quality-of-experience (QoE) while ensuring at the same time
the stability of the global control loop in the presence of communication
delay. In this paper, we propose a dynamic control scheme switching strategy
for teleoperation systems, which maximizes the QoE for time-varying
communication delay. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed
approach, we perform a dedicated case study for a virtual teleoperation
environment consisting of a one-dimensional spring-damper system, and conduct
extensive subjective tests under various delay conditions for two control
schemes: (1) teleoperation with the time-domain passivity approach (TDPA),
which is highly delay-sensitive but supports highly dynamic interaction between
the operator and a potentially quickly changing remote environment; (2)
model-mediated teleoperation (MMT), which is tolerable to relatively larger
communication delays, but unsuitable for quickly changing, highly dynamic
remote environments. For both schemes, we use recently proposed extensions,
which incorporate perceptual data reduction to reduce the required packet rate
between the operator and the teleoperator. One key contribution of this paper
lies in the exploration of the intrinsic relationship among QoE, communication
delay and the control schemes which provides a fundamental guidance, not only
to this research, but also to the future joint optimization of communication
and control for time-delayed teleoperation systems."
"Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG)
enable communication for people with severe disabilities. In this paper we
present a system that enables the use of regular computers using an
off-the-shelf EEG/EMG headset, providing a pointing device and virtual keyboard
that can be used to operate any Windows based system, minimizing the user
effort required for interacting with a personal computer. Effectiveness of the
proposed system is evaluated by a usability study, indicating decreasing
learning curve for completing various tasks. The proposed system is available
in the link provided."
"Purpose. We present a new method to evaluate the accuracy of an eye tracker
based eye localization system. Measuring the accuracy of an eye tracker's
primary intention, the estimated point of gaze, is usually done with volunteers
and a set of fixation points used as ground truth. However, verifying the
accuracy of the location estimate of a volunteer's eye center in 3D space is
not easily possible. This is because the eye center is an intangible point
hidden by the iris. Methods. We evaluate the eye location accuracy by using an
eye phantom instead of eyes of volunteers. For this, we developed a testing
stage with a realistic artificial eye and a corresponding kinematic model,
which we trained with {\mu}CT data. This enables us to precisely evaluate the
eye location estimate of an eye tracker. Results. We show that the proposed
testing stage with the corresponding kinematic model is suitable for such a
validation. Further, we evaluate a particular eye tracker based navigation
system and show that this system is able to successfully determine the eye
center with sub-millimeter accuracy. Conclusions. We show the suitability of
the evaluated eye tracker for eye interventions, using the proposed testing
stage and the corresponding kinematic model. The results further enable
specific enhancement of the navigation system to potentially get even better
results."
"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) can help patients of neuromuscular diseases
restore parts of the movement and communication abilities that they have lost.
Most of BCIs rely on mapping brain activities to device instructions, but
limited number of brain activities decides the limited abilities of BCIs. To
deal with the problem of limited ablility of BCI, this paper verified the
feasibility of constructing BCI based on decoding imagined speech
electroencephalography (EEG). As sentences decoded from EEG can have rich
meanings, BCIs based on EEG decoding can achieve numerous control instructions.
By combining a modified EEG feature extraction mehtod with connectionist
temporal classification (CTC), this paper simulated decoding imagined speech
EEG using synthetic EEG data without help of speech signal. The performance of
decoding model over synthetic data to a certain extent demonstrated the
feasibility of constructing BCI based on imagined speech brain signal."
"This paper aims to investigate the effect of acceleration on the discomfort
of standing passengers. The acceleration levels from different public rail
transport lines such as the mass rapid transits (MRTs) and light rail transits
(LRTs) of Singapore, as well as the associated qualitative data indicating the
discomfort of standing passengers were collected and analyzed. Based on a
logistic regression model to analyze the data, a discomfort index was
introduced, which can be used to compare various rail lines based on ride
comfort. A method for predicting the discomfort of passengers based on the
acceleration values was proposed for any given train line."
"This paper presents a novel approach, called AirScript, for creating,
recognizing and visualizing documents in air. We present a novel algorithm,
called 2-DifViz, that converts the hand movements in air (captured by a
Myo-armband worn by a user) into a sequence of x, y coordinates on a 2D
Cartesian plane, and visualizes them on a canvas. Existing sensor-based
approaches either do not provide visual feedback or represent the recognized
characters using prefixed templates. In contrast, AirScript stands out by
giving freedom of movement to the user, as well as by providing a real-time
visual feedback of the written characters, making the interaction natural.
AirScript provides a recognition module to predict the content of the document
created in air. To do so, we present a novel approach based on deep learning,
which uses the sensor data and the visualizations created by 2-DifViz. The
recognition module consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks. The output from these three networks is
fused to get the final prediction about the characters written in air.
AirScript can be used in highly sophisticated environments like a smart
classroom, a smart factory or a smart laboratory, where it would enable people
to annotate pieces of texts wherever they want without any reference surface.
We have evaluated AirScript against various well-known learning models (HMM,
KNN, SVM, etc.) on the data of 12 participants. Evaluation results show that
the recognition module of AirScript largely outperforms all of these models by
achieving an accuracy of 91.7% in a person independent evaluation and a 96.7%
accuracy in a person dependent evaluation."
"Human errors in performing security-critical tasks are typically blamed on
the complexity of those tasks. However, such errors can also occur because of
(possibly unexpected) sensory distractions. A sensory distraction that produces
negative effects can be abused by the adversary that controls the environment.
Meanwhile, a distraction with positive effects can be artificially introduced
to improve user performance.
  The goal of this work is to explore the effects of visual stimuli on the
performance of security-critical tasks. To this end, we experimented with a
large number of subjects who were exposed to a range of unexpected visual
stimuli while attempting to perform Bluetooth Pairing. Our results clearly
demonstrate substantially increased task completion times and markedly lower
task success rates. These negative effects are noteworthy, especially, when
contrasted with prior results on audio distractions which had positive effects
on performance of similar tasks. Experiments were conducted in a novel (fully
automated and completely unattended) experimental environment. This yielded
more uniform experiments, better scalability and significantly lower financial
and logistical burdens. We discuss this experience, including benefits and
limitations of the unattended automated experiment paradigm."
"Supporting programming on touchscreen devices requires effective text input
and editing methods. Unfortunately, the virtual keyboard can be inefficient and
uses valuable screen space on already small devices. Recent advances in stylus
input make handwriting a potentially viable text input solution for programming
on touchscreen devices. The primary barrier, however, is that handwriting
recognition systems are built to take advantage of the rules of natural
language, not those of a programming language. In this paper, we explore this
particular problem of handwriting recognition for source code. We collect and
make publicly available a dataset of handwritten Python code samples from 15
participants and we characterize the typical recognition errors for this
handwritten Python source code when using a state-of-the-art handwriting
recognition tool. We present an approach to improve the recognition accuracy by
augmenting a handwriting recognizer with the programming language grammar
rules. Our experiment on the collected dataset shows an 8.6% word error rate
and a 3.6% character error rate which outperforms standard handwriting
recognition systems and compares favorably to typing source code on virtual
keyboards."
"On Kickstarter only 36% of crowdfunding campaigns successfully raise
sufficient funds for their projects. In this paper, we explore the possibility
of redistribution of crowdfunding donations to increase the chances of success.
We define several intuitive redistribution policies and, using data from a real
crowdfunding platform, LaunchGood, we assess the potential improvement in
campaign fundraising success rates. We find that an aggressive redistribution
scheme can boost campaign success rates from 37% to 79%, but such
choice-agnostic redistribution schemes come at the cost of disregarding donor
preferences. Taking inspiration from offline giving societies and donor clubs,
we build a case for choice preserving redistribution schemes that strike a
balance between increasing the number of successful campaigns and respecting
giving preference. We find that choice-preserving redistribution can easily
achieve campaign success rates of 48%. Finally, we discuss the implications of
these different redistribution schemes for the various stakeholders in the
crowdfunding ecosystem."
"Three-dimensional (3D) applications have come to every corner of life. We
present 3DTouch, a novel 3D wearable input device worn on the fingertip for
interacting with 3D applications. 3DTouch is self-contained, and designed to
universally work on various 3D platforms. The device employs touch input for
the benefits of passive haptic feedback, and movement stability. Moreover, with
touch interaction, 3DTouch is conceptually less fatiguing to use over many
hours than 3D spatial input devices such as Kinect. Our approach relies on
relative positioning technique using an optical laser sensor and a 9-DOF
inertial measurement unit. We implemented a set of 3D interaction techniques
including selection, translation, and rotation using 3DTouch. An evaluation
also demonstrates the device's tracking accuracy of 1.10 mm and 2.33 degrees
for subtle touch interaction in 3D space. With 3DTouch project, we would like
to provide an input device that reduces the gap between 3D applications and
users."
"Feedback tools help people to monitor information about themselves to improve
their health, sustainability practices, or personal well-being. Yet reasoning
about personal data (e.g., pedometer counts, blood pressure readings, or home
electricity consumption) to gain a deep understanding of your current practices
and how to change can be challenging with the data alone. We integrate
quantitative feedback data within a personal digital calendar; this approach
aims to make the feedback data readily accessible and more comprehensible. We
report on an eight-week field study of an on-calendar visualization tool.
Results showed that a personal calendar can provide rich context for people to
reason about their feedback data. The on-calendar visualization enabled people
to quickly identify and reason about regular patterns and anomalies. Based on
our results, we also derived a model of the behavior feedback process that
extends existing technology adoption models. With that, we reflected on
potential barriers for the ongoing use of feedback tools."
"In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two distinct techniques
(Special Moment Approach & Spatial Frequency Approach) for reviewing the
lifelogs, which were collected by lifeloggers who were willing to use a
wearable camera and a bracelet simultaneously for two days. Generally, Special
moment approach is a technique for extracting episodic events and Spatial
frequency approach is a technique for associating visual with temporal and
location information, especially heat map is applied as the spatial data for
expressing frequency awareness. Based on that, the participants were asked to
fill in two post-study questionnaires for evaluating the effectiveness of those
two techniques and their combination. The preliminary result showed the
positive potential of exploring individual lifelogs using our approaches."
"NMR spectroscopy analysis is a detail-oriented analytic feat that typically
requires specific domain expertise and hours of concentration. This work
presents an ethnographic-style study of this analysis process in the context of
evaluating the symptoms of cognitive depletion. The repeated, non-trivial
decisions required by and the time-consuming nature of NMR spectroscopy
analysis make it an ideal, real-world scenario to study the symptoms of
cognitive depletion, its effect on workflow and performance, and potential
strategies for mitigating its deleterious effects."
"We present the results of a user study with novice NMR analysts (N=19)
involving a gamified simulation of the NMR analysis process. Participants
solved randomly generated spectrum puzzles for up to three hours. We used eye
tracking, event logging, and observations to record symptoms of cognitive
depletion while participants worked. Analysis of results indicate that we can
detect both signs of learning and signs of cognitive depletion in participants
over the course of the three hours. Participants' break strategies did not
predict or reflect game scores, but certain symptoms appear predictive of
breaks."
"Jitter is an inevitable byproduct of gaze detection. Because of this, gaze
typing tends to be a slow and frustrating process. In this paper, we propose
SliceType, an on-screen keyboard that is optimized for gaze input. Our main
objective is to use the screen area more efficiently. We achieve this by
determining the keys that will not be used for the next input, and allocating
their space to adjacent keys with a merging animation. We placed the frequently
and rarely used key pairs adjacently to facilitate the merging function. While
targeting larger keys, the jitter introduced by the eye tracker becomes less
hindering. This results in the user typing faster and more comfortably. A
character and a related prediction is displayed at each key. Dwelling at a key
enters the character, and double-dwelling enters the prediction. While dwelling
on a key to enter a character, the user reads the related prediction
effortlessly. The improvements provided by these features are quantified using
the Fitts' law. The performance of the proposed keyboard is compared with two
other soft keyboards designed for gaze typing, Dasher and GazeTalk. 37 novice
users gaze-typed a piece of text using all three keyboards. The results of the
experiment show that the proposed keyboard allows faster typing, and is better
preferred by the users."
"Gaze-based virtual keyboards provide an effective interface for text entry by
eye movements. The efficiency and usability of these keyboards have
traditionally been evaluated with conventional text entry performance measures
such as words per minute, keystrokes per character, backspace usage, etc.
However, in comparison to the traditional text entry approaches, gaze-based
typing involves natural eye movements that are highly correlated with human
brain cognition. Employing eye gaze as an input could lead to excessive mental
demand, and in this work we argue the need to include cognitive load as an eye
typing evaluation measure. We evaluate three variations of gaze-based virtual
keyboards, which implement variable designs in terms of word suggestion
positioning. The conventional text entry metrics indicate no significant
difference in the performance of the different keyboard designs. However, STFT
(Short-time Fourier Transform) based analysis of EEG signals indicate variances
in the mental workload of participants while interacting with these designs.
Moreover, the EEG analysis provides insights into the user's cognition
variation for different typing phases and intervals, which should be considered
in order to improve eye typing usability."
"Human computation games (HCGs) are a crowdsourcing approach to solving
computationally-intractable tasks using games. In this paper, we describe the
need for generalizable HCG design knowledge that accommodates the needs of both
players and tasks. We propose a formal representation of the mechanics in HCGs,
providing a structural breakdown to visualize, compare, and explore the space
of HCG mechanics. We present a methodology based on small-scale design
experiments using fixed tasks while varying game elements to observe effects on
both the player experience and the human computation task completion. Finally
we discuss applications of our framework using comparisons of prior HCGs and
recent design experiments. Ultimately, we wish to enable easier exploration and
development of HCGs, helping these games provide meaningful player experiences
while solving difficult problems."
"The Google's frugal Cardboard solution for immersive Virtual Reality
experiences has come a long way in the VR market. The Google Cardboard VR
applications will support us in the fields such as education, virtual tourism,
entertainment, gaming, design etc. Recently, Qualcomm's Vuforia SDK has
introduced support for developing mixed reality applications for Google
Cardboard which can combine Virtual and Augmented Reality to develop exciting
and immersive experiences. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of
Google Cardboard for AR and also highlight its technical and subjective
limitations by conducting a feasibility study through the inspection of a
Desktop computer use-case. Additionally, we recommend the future avenues for
the Google Cardboard in AR. This work also serves as a guide for Android/iOS
developers as there are no published scholarly articles or well documented
studies exclusively on Google Cardboard with both user and developer's
experience captured at one place."
"The development of computer technology has been rapid. Not so long ago, the
first computer was developed which was large and bulky. Now, the latest
generation of smartphones has a calculation power, which would have been
considered those of supercomputers in 1990. For a smart environment, the person
recognition and re-recognition is an important topic. The distribution of new
technologies like wearable computing is a new approach to the field of person
recognition and re-recognition. This article lays out the idea of identifying
and re-identifying wearable computing devices by listening to their wireless
communication connectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and building a
classification of interaction scenarios for the combination of
human-wearable-environment."
"Human occupancy information is crucial for any modern Building Management
System (BMS). Implementing pervasive sensing and leveraging Carbon Dioxide data
from BMS sensor, we present Carbon Dioxide - Human Occupancy Counter (CD-HOC),
a novel way to estimate the number of people within a closed space from a
single carbon dioxide sensor. CD-HOC de-noises and pre-processes the carbon
dioxide data. We utilise both seasonal-trend decomposition based on Loess and
seasonal-trend decomposition with moving average to factorise carbon dioxide
data. For each trend, seasonal and irregular component, we model different
regression algorithms to predict each respective human occupancy component
value. We propose a zero pattern adjustment model to increase the accuracy and
finally, we use additive decomposition to reconstruct the prediction value. We
run our model in two different locations that have different contexts. The
first location is an academic staff room and the second is a cinema theatre.
Our results show an average of 4.33% increment in accuracy for the small room
with 94.68% indoor human occupancy counting and 8.46% increase for the cinema
theatre in comparison to the accuracy of the baseline method, support vector
regression."
"The scientific community use PDEs to model a range of problems. The people in
this domain are interested in visualizing their results, but existing
mechanisms for visualization can not handle the full richness of computations
in the domain. We did an exploration to see how Diderot, a domain specific
language for scientific visualization and image analysis, could be used to
solve this problem.
  We demonstrate our first and modest approach of visualizing FE data with
Diderot and provide examples. Using Diderot, we do a simple sampling and a
volume rendering of a FE field. These examples showcase Diderot's ability to
provide a visualization result for Firedrake. This paper describes the
extension of the Diderot language to include FE data."
"Smart devices have become common place in many homes, and these devices can
be utilized to provide support for people with mental or physical deficits.
Voice-controlled assistants are a class of smart device that collect a large
amount of data in the home. In this work we present Echo SCraper and ClAssifier
of Persons (ESCAPE), an open source software for the extraction of Amazon Echo
interaction data, and speaker recognition on that data. We show that ESCAPE is
able to extract data from a voice-controlled assistant and classify with
accuracy who is talking, based on a small number of labeled audio data. Using
ESCAPE to extract interactions recorded over 3 months in the first author's
home yields a rich dataset of transcribed audio recordings. Our results
demonstrate that using this software the Amazon Echo can be used to study
participants in a naturalistic setting with minimal intrusion. We also discuss
the potential for usage of voice-controlled devices together with ESCAPE to
understand how diseases affect individuals, and how these data can be used to
monitor disease processes in general."
"Virtual Reality (VR) becomes accessible to mimic a ""real-like"" world now.
People who have a VR experience usually can be impressed by the immersive
feeling, they might consider themselves are actually existed in the VR space.
Self-consciousness is important for people to identify their own characters in
VR space, and illusory ownership can help people to ""build"" their ""bodies"". The
rubber hand illusion can convince us a fake hand made by rubber is a part of
our bodies under certain circumstances. Researches about autoscopic phenomena
extend this illusory to the so-called full body illusion. We conducted 3 type
of experiments to study the illusory ownership in VR space as it shows in
Figure 1, and we learned: Human body must receive the synchronized visual
signal and somatosensory stimulus at the same time; The visual signal must be
the first person perceptive; the subject and the virtual body needs to be the
same height as much as possible. All these illusory ownerships accompanied by
the body temperature decreases, where the body is stimulated."
"With the intention of bringing uniformity to Bengali text entry research,
here we present a new approach for calculating the most popular English text
entry evaluation metrics for Bengali. To demonstrate our approach, we conducted
a user study where we evaluated four popular Bengali text entry techniques."
"Mobile applications (a.k.a., apps), which facilitate a large variety of tasks
on mobile devices, have become indispensable in our everyday lives.
Accomplishing a task may require the user to navigate among various apps.
Unlike Web pages that are inherently interconnected through hyperlinks, mobile
apps are usually isolated building blocks, and the lack of direct links between
apps has largely compromised the efficiency of task completion. In this paper,
we present the first in-depth empirical study of inter-app navigation behaviors
of smartphone users based on a comprehensive dataset collected through a
sizable user study over three months. We propose a model to distinguish
informational pages and transitional pages, based on which a large number of
inter-app navigation are identified. We reveal that developing 'tunnels'
between of isolated apps has a huge potential to reduce the cost of navigation.
Our analysis provides various practical implications on how to improve
app-navigation experiences from both the operating system's perspective and the
developer's perspective."
"In this paper we consider the modern theory of the Bayesian brain from
cognitive neurosciences in the light of recommender systems and expose
potentials for our community. In particular, we elaborate on noisy user
feedback and the thus resulting multicomponent user models, which have indeed a
biological origin. In real user experiments we observe the impact of both
factors directly in a repeated rating task along with recommendation. As a
consequence, this contribution supports the plausibility of contemporary
theories of mind in the context of recommender systems and can be understood as
a solicitation to integrate ideas of cognitive neurosciences into our systems
in order to further improve the prediction of human behaviour."
"Modern industrial automatic machines and robotic cells are equipped with
highly complex human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that often prevent human
operators from an effective use of the automatic systems. In particular, this
applies to vulnerable users, such as those with low experience or education
level, the elderly and the disabled. To tackle this issue, it becomes necessary
to design user-oriented HMIs, which adapt to the capabilities and skills of
users, thus compensating their limitations and taking full advantage of their
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a methodological approach to the design of
complex adaptive human-machine systems that might be inclusive of all users, in
particular the vulnerable ones. The proposed approach takes into account both
the technical requirements and the requirements for ethical, legal and social
implications (ELSI) for the design of automatic systems. The technical
requirements derive from a thorough analysis of three use cases taken from the
European project INCLUSIVE. To achieve the ELSI requirements, the MEESTAR
approach is combined with the specific legal issues for occupational systems
and requirements of the target users."
"Modern manufacturing systems typically require high degrees of flexibility,
in terms of ability to customize the production lines to the constantly
changing market requests. For this purpose, manufacturing systems are required
to be able to cope with changes in the types of products, and in the size of
the production batches. As a consequence, the human-machine interfaces (HMIs)
are typically very complex, and include a wide range of possible operational
modes and commands. This generally implies an unsustainable cognitive workload
for the human operators, in addition to a non-negligible training effort. To
overcome this issue, in this paper we present a methodology for the design of
adaptive human-centred HMIs for industrial machines and robots. The proposed
approach relies on three pillars: measurement of user's capabilities,
adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user.
The results expected from the application of the proposed methodology are
investigated in terms of increased customization and productivity of
manufacturing processes, and wider acceptance of automation technologies. The
proposed approach has been devised in the framework of the European project
INCLUSIVE."
"In this paper, we examine the statistical soundness of comparative
assessments within the field of recommender systems in terms of reliability and
human uncertainty. From a controlled experiment, we get the insight that users
provide different ratings on same items when repeatedly asked. This volatility
of user ratings justifies the assumption of using probability densities instead
of single rating scores. As a consequence, the well-known accuracy metrics
(e.g. MAE, MSE, RMSE) yield a density themselves that emerges from convolution
of all rating densities. When two different systems produce different RMSE
distributions with significant intersection, then there exists a probability of
error for each possible ranking. As an application, we examine possible ranking
errors of the Netflix Prize. We are able to show that all top rankings are more
or less subject to high probabilities of error and that some rankings may be
deemed to be caused by mere chance rather than system quality."
"Emotions play a central role in most forms of natural human interaction so we
may expect that computational methods for the processing and expression of
emotions will play a growing role in human-computer interaction. The OCC model
has established itself as the standard model for emotion synthesis. A large
number of studies employed the OCC model to generate emotions for their
embodied characters. Many developers of such characters believe that the OCC
model will be all they ever need to equip their character with emotions. This
study reflects on the limitations of the OCC model specifically, and on the
emotion models in general due to their dependency on artificial intelligence."
"With the increasing amount of data being visualized in large information
spaces, methods providing data-driven context have become indispensable.
Off-screen visualization techniques, therefore, have been extensively
researched for their ability to overcome the inherent trade-off between
overview and detail. The general idea is to project off-screen located objects
back to the available screen real estate. Detached visual cues, such as halos
or arrows, encode information on position and distance, but fall short showing
the topology of off-screen objects. For that reason, state of the art
techniques integrate visual cues into a dedicated border region. As yet, the
dimensions of the navigated space are not reflected properly, which is why we
propose to adapt the intrusion of the border pursuant to the position in space.
Moreover, off-screen objects are projected to the border region using one out
of two projection methods: Radial or Orthographic. We describe a controlled
experiment to investigate the effect of the adaptive border intrusion to the
topology as well as the users' intuition regarding the projection strategy. The
results of our experiment suggest to use the orthographic projection strategy
for unconnected point data in an adaptive border design. We further discuss the
results including the given informal feedback of participants."
"Success of Wikipedia would not be possible without the contributions of
millions of anonymous Internet users who edit articles, correct mistakes, add
links or pictures. At the same time Wikipedia editors are currently overworked
and there is always more tasks waiting to be completed than people willing to
volunteer. The paper explores the possibility of involving the elderly in the
Wikipedia editing process. Older adults were asked to complete various tasks on
Wikipedia. Based on the observations made during these activities as well as
in-depth interviews, a list of recommendation has been crafted. It turned out
that older adults are willing to contribute to Wikiepdia but substantial
changes have to be made in the Wikipedia editor."
"Entry-level crowd work is often reported to pay less than minimum wage. While
this may be appropriate or even necessary, due to various legal, economic, and
pragmatic factors, some Requesters and workers continue to question this status
quo. To promote further discussion on the issue, we survey Requesters and
workers whether they would support restricting tasks to require minimum wage
pay. As a form of design activism, we confronted workers with this dilemma
directly by posting a dummy Mechanical Turk task which told them that they
could not work on it because it paid less than their local minimum wage, and we
invited their feedback. Strikingly, for those workers expressing an opinion,
two-thirds of Indians favored the policy while two-thirds of Americans opposed
it. Though a majority of Requesters supported minimum wage pay, only 20\% would
enforce it. To further empower Requesters, and to ensure that effort or
ignorance are not barriers to change, we provide a simple public API to make it
easy to find a worker's local minimum wage by his/her IP address."
"We present an interactive visualisation tool for recommending travel
trajectories. This system is based on new machine learning formulations and
algorithms for the sequence recommendation problem. The system starts from a
map-based overview, taking an interactive query as starting point. It then
breaks down contributions from different geographical and user behavior
features, and those from individual points-of-interest versus pairs of
consecutive points on a route. The system also supports detailed quantitative
interrogation by comparing a large number of features for multiple points.
Effective trajectory visualisations can potentially benefit a large cohort of
online map users and assist their decision-making. More broadly, the design of
this system can inform visualisations of other structured prediction tasks,
such as for sequences or trees."
"This paper is concerned with the design and implementation of an innovative
user support system in the frame of an open educational environment. The
environment adapted is ModelsCreator (MC), an educational system supporting
learning through modelling activities. The pupils typical interaction with the
system was modelled us-ing Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). This model has been
used in ModelsCreator to build an adaptive help system providing the most
useful guidelines according to the current state of interaction. A brief
description of the system and an overview of application of Bayesian techniques
to educational systems is presented together with discussion about the process
of building of the Bayesian Network derived from actual student interaction
data. A preliminary evaluation of the developed prototype indicates that the
proposed approach produces systems with promising performance."
"This paper describes the design and evaluation of the vision-based
classification of social gestures, such as handshake, hug, high-five, etc. This
is a component of the mediated social touch systems, which can be incorporated
into ShareTable and SqueezeBands system to achieve automated gestures
recognition and transmission of the touch between the users in real time. The
results from our pilot study show the recognition accuracy of each gestures,
and they indicate that significant future work is necessary to improve its
practical feasibility in the mediated social touch applications."
"Researchers, technology reviewers, and governmental agencies have expressed
concern that automation may necessitate the introduction of added displays to
indicate vehicle intent in vehicle-to-pedestrian interactions. An automated
online methodology for obtaining communication intent perceptions for 30
external vehicle-to-pedestrian display concepts was implemented and tested
using Amazon Mechanic Turk. Data from 200 qualified participants was quickly
obtained and processed. In addition to producing a useful early-stage
evaluation of these specific design concepts, the test demonstrated that the
methodology is scalable so that a large number of design elements or minor
variations can be assessed through a series of runs even on much larger samples
in a matter of hours. Using this approach, designers should be able to refine
concepts both more quickly and in more depth than available development
resources typically allow. Some concerns and questions about common assumptions
related to the implementation of vehicle-to-pedestrian displays are posed."
"A new system of hexadecimal and base-256 numerals is proposed whose digit
shapes are based on binary numerals. The proposed numerals are implemented in
open source fonts and integrated into popular editors (Notepad++ and Eclipse)
to prove the concept."
"Increasingly more people use computers and create content using keyboards
(even with leading edge touch-screen technology). As in the most part of the
world, in Latvia also conventional ""Qwerty"" keyboard is used. Though for
Latvian it is much worse than for English, especially due to enormous load to
little fingers. It causes repetitive strain injuries and affects productivity
of workers with extensive keyboard usage, especially for data input operators,
call centers, inquiry office workers, etc. Improving computer keyboard layout
decrease stress to hands and fingers thus minimizing exhaustion and injuries.
With analysis of English and Latvian public domain novels and modern texts,
letter appearance an sequence distribution for Latvian language was found.
Qualities of alternative layouts for English (Dvorak, Colemak, Hallinstad) were
investigated and open source carpalx simulation tool was adjusted according to
the findings. Then carpalx was used to check more than 25 million keyboard
layouts, measuring finger/hand effort, stroke typing convenience etc., to find
the best one. It was proved that existing ""\v{S}usildatec"" (classic Latvian
Ergonomic standard) keyboard is only slightly better than ""Qwerty"" for Latvian,
though it is much worse for English. After computer simulation, several best
layouts were tried practically for more than 6 months and most convenient one
was promoted as a new ""Latvian Modern"" keyboard. Its typing effort is less than
for ""\v{S}usildatec"", load is distributed according to finger strength, and
typing strokes are alternating better between hands and fingers. Comparing to
""Qwerty"" keyboard new layout is better not only for Latvian but for English
also. Keyboard drivers are developed for Microsoft Windows and Linux operating
systems and are freely available in the web under permissive license."
"Dimensionality reduction is a common method for analyzing and visualizing
high-dimensional data across domains. Dimensionality-reduction algorithms
involve complex optimizations and reduced dimensions but generally lack clear
relation to the initial data dimensions, so that interpreting and reasoning
about dimensionality reductions can be difficult. In this work, we introduce
two interaction techniques, forward projection and backward projection, for
reasoning dynamically about scatter plots of dimensionally reduced data. We
also contribute two related visualization techniques, prolines and feasibility
map, to facilitate and enrich the effective use of the proposed interactions,
which we integrate in a new tool called Praxis. To evaluate our techniques, we
first analyze their time and accuracy performance across varying sample and
dimension sizes. We then conduct a user study in which twelve data scientists
use Praxis so as to assess the usefulness of the techniques in performing
exploratory data analysis tasks. Results suggest that our visual interactions
are intuitive and effective for exploring dimensionality reductions and
generating hypotheses about the underlying data."
"We present a framework to identify whether a public speaker's body movements
are meaningful or non-meaningful (""Mannerisms"") in the context of their
speeches. In a dataset of 84 public speaking videos from 28 individuals, we
extract 314 unique body movement patterns (e.g. pacing, gesturing, shifting
body weights, etc.). Online workers and the speakers themselves annotated the
meaningfulness of the patterns. We extracted five types of features from the
audio-video recordings: disfluency, prosody, body movements, facial, and
lexical. We use linear classifiers to predict the annotations with AUC up to
0.82. Analysis of the classifier weights reveals that it puts larger weights on
the lexical features while predicting self-annotations. Contrastingly, it puts
a larger weight on prosody features while predicting audience annotations. This
analysis might provide subtle hint that public speakers tend to focus more on
the verbal features while evaluating self-performances. The audience, on the
other hand, tends to focus more on the non-verbal aspects of the speech. The
dataset and code associated with this work has been released for peer review
and further analysis."
"As automated vehicles and their technology become more advanced and
technically sophisticated, evaluation procedures that can measure the safety
and reliability of these new driverless cars must develop far beyond existing
safety tests. To get an accurate assessment in field tests, such cars would
have to be driven millions or even billions of miles to arrive at an acceptable
level of certainty - a time-consuming process that would cost tens of millions
of dollars.
  Instead, researchers affiliated with the University of Michigan's Mcity
connected and automated vehicle center have developed an accelerated evaluation
process that eliminates the many miles of uneventful driving activity to filter
out only the potentially dangerous driving situations where an automated
vehicle needs to respond, creating a faster, less expensive testing program.
This approach can reduce the amount of testing needed by a factor of 300 to
100,000 so that an automated vehicle driven for 1,000 test miles can yield the
equivalent of 300,000 to 100 million miles of real-world driving.
  While more research and development needs to be done to perfect this
technique, the accelerated evaluation procedure offers a ground-breaking
solution for safe and efficient testing that is crucial to deploying automated
vehicles."
"Low-quality results have been a long-standing problem on microtask
crowdsourcing platforms, driving away requesters and justifying low wages for
workers. To date, workers have been blamed for low-quality results: they are
said to make as little effort as possible, do not pay attention to detail, and
lack expertise. In this paper, we hypothesize that requesters may also be
responsible for low-quality work: they launch unclear task designs that confuse
even earnest workers, under-specify edge cases, and neglect to include
examples. We introduce prototype tasks, a crowdsourcing strategy requiring all
new task designs to launch a small number of sample tasks. Workers attempt
these tasks and leave feedback, enabling the re- quester to iterate on the
design before publishing it. We report a field experiment in which tasks that
underwent prototype task iteration produced higher-quality work results than
the original task designs. With this research, we suggest that a simple and
rapid iteration cycle can improve crowd work, and we provide empirical evidence
that requester ""quality"" directly impacts result quality."
"Security products often create more problems than they solve, drowning users
in alerts without providing the context required to remediate threats. This
challenge is compounded by a lack of experienced personnel and security tools
with complex interfaces. These interfaces require users to become domain
experts or rely on repetitive, time consuming tasks to turn this data deluge
into actionable intelligence. In this paper we present Artemis, a
conversational interface to endpoint detection and response (EDR) event data.
Artemis leverages dialog to drive the automation of complex tasks and reduce
the need to learn a structured query language. Designed to empower
inexperienced and junior security workers to better understand their security
environment, Artemis provides an intuitive platform to ask questions of alert
data as users are guided through triage and hunt workflows. In this paper, we
will discuss our user-centric design methodology, feedback from user
interviews, and the design requirements generated upon completion of our study.
We will also present core functionality, findings from scenario-based testing,
and future research for the Artemis platform."
"In 2014, more than 10 million people in the US were affected by an ambulatory
disability. Thus, gait rehabilitation is a crucial part of health care systems.
The quantification of human locomotion enables clinicians to describe and
analyze a patient's gait performance in detail and allows them to base clinical
decisions on objective data. These assessments generate a vast amount of
complex data which need to be interpreted in a short time period. We conducted
a design study in cooperation with gait analysis experts to develop a novel
Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics solution for clinical Gait analysis
(KAVAGait). KAVAGait allows the clinician to store and inspect complex data
derived during clinical gait analysis. The system incorporates innovative and
interactive visual interface concepts, which were developed based on the needs
of clinicians. Additionally, an explicit knowledge store (EKS) allows
externalization and storage of implicit knowledge from clinicians. It makes
this information available for others, supporting the process of data
inspection and clinical decision making. We validated our system by conducting
expert reviews, a user study, and a case study. Results suggest that KAVAGait
is able to support a clinician during clinical practice by visualizing complex
gait data and providing knowledge of other clinicians."
"Head gesture is a natural means of face-to-face communication between people
but the recognition of head gestures in the context of virtual reality and use
of head gesture as an interface for interacting with virtual avatars and
virtual environments have been rarely investigated. In the current study, we
present an approach for real-time head gesture recognition on head-mounted
displays using Cascaded Hidden Markov Models. We conducted two experiments to
evaluate our proposed approach. In experiment 1, we trained the Cascaded Hidden
Markov Models and assessed the offline classification performance using
collected head motion data. In experiment 2, we characterized the real-time
performance of the approach by estimating the latency to recognize a head
gesture with recorded real-time classification data. Our results show that the
proposed approach is effective in recognizing head gestures. The method can be
integrated into a virtual reality system as a head gesture interface for
interacting with virtual worlds."
"Older users population is rapidly increasing all over the World. Presently,
we observe efforts in the human-computer interaction domain aiming to improve
life quality of age 65 and over through the use of mobile apps. Nonetheless,
these efforts focus primary on interface and interaction de- sign. Little work
has focused on the study of motivation to use and adherence to, of elderly to
technology. Developing specific design guidelines for this population is
relevant, however it should be parallel to the study of desire of elderly to
embrace specific technology in their life. Designers should not be limited to
technology design but consider as well how to fully convey the value that
technology can bring to the lives of the users and motivate adoption. This
position paper discusses techniques that might nudge elderly towards the use of
new technology."
"Position: (1) Partial solutions to machine intelligence can lead to systems
which may be useful creating interesting and expressive musical works. (2) An

infancy."
"Interaction methods based on computer-vision hold the potential to become the
next powerful technology to support breakthroughs in the field of
human-computer interaction. Non-invasive vision-based techniques permit
unconventional interaction methods to be considered, including use of movements
of the face and head for intentional gestural control of computer systems.
Facial gesture interfaces open new possibilities for assistive input
technologies. This chapter gives an overview of research aimed at developing
vision-based head and face-tracking interfaces. This work has important
implications for future assistive input devices. To illustrate this concretely
we describe work from our own research in which we developed two vision-based
facial feature tracking algorithms for human computer interaction and assistive
input. Evaluation forms a critical component of this research and we provide
examples of new quantitative evaluation tasks as well as the use of model
real-world applications for the qualitative evaluation of new interaction
styles."
"Digital and interactive technologies are becoming increasingly embedded in
everyday lives of people around the world. Application of technologies such as
real-time, context-aware, and interactive technologies; augmented and immersive
realities; social media; and location-based services has been particularly
evident in urban environments where technological and sociocultural
infrastructures enable easier deployment and adoption as compared to non-urban
areas. There has been growing consumer demand for new forms of experiences and
services enabled through these emerging technologies. We call this ambient
media, as the media is embedded in the natural human living environment.

"There is a perceived controversy as to whether the cognitive representation
of affect is better modelled using a dimensional or categorical theory. This
paper first suggests that these views are, in fact, compatible. The paper then
discusses this theme and related issues in reference to a commonly stated
application domain of research on human affect and expression: human computer
interaction (HCI). The novel suggestion here is that a more realistic framing
of studies of human affect in expression with reference to HCI and,
particularly HCHI (Human-Computer-Human Interaction) entails some
re-formulation of the approach to the basic phenomena themselves. This theme is
illustrated with several examples from several recent research projects."
"Since the launch of Google Glass in 2014, smart glasses have mainly been
designed to support micro-interactions. The ultimate goal for them to become an
augmented reality interface has not yet been attained due to an encumbrance of
controls. Augmented reality involves superimposing interactive computer
graphics images onto physical objects in the real world. This survey reviews
current research issues in the area of human computer interaction for smart
glasses. The survey first studies the smart glasses available in the market and
afterwards investigates the interaction methods proposed in the wide body of
literature. The interaction methods can be classified into hand-held, touch,
and touchless input. This paper mainly focuses on the touch and touchless
input. Touch input can be further divided into on-device and on-body, while
touchless input can be classified into hands-free and freehand. Next, we
summarize the existing research efforts and trends, in which touch and
touchless input are evaluated by a total of eight interaction goals. Finally,
we discuss several key design challenges and the possibility of multi-modal
input for smart glasses."
"User interfaces that adapt their characteristics to those of the user are
referred to as adaptive interfaces. We propose Adaptive Agent Oriented Software
Architecture (AAOSA) as a new way of designing adaptive interfaces. AAOSA is a
new approach to software design based on an agent-oriented architecture. In
this approach agents are considered adaptively communicating concurrent modules
which are divided into a white box module responsible for the communications
and learning, and a black box which is responsible for the independent
specialized processes of the agent. A distributed learning policy that makes
use of this architecture is used for purposes of system adaptability."
"This paper proposes a method for identification of a user`s fixed string set
(which can be a command/instruction set for a terminal or microprocessor). This
method is fast and has very small memory requirements, compared to a
traditional full string storage and compare method. The user feeds characters
into a microcontroller via a keyboard or another microprocessor sends commands
and the microcontroller hashes the input in order to identify valid commands,
ensuring no collisions between hashed valid strings, while applying further
criteria to narrow collision between random and valid strings. The method
proposed narrows the possibility of the latter kind of collision, achieving
small code and memory-size utilization and very fast execution. Hashing is
achieved using additive & rotating hash functions in an iterative form, which
can be very easily implemented in simple microcontrollers and microprocessors.
Such hash functions are presented and compared according to their efficiency
for a given string/command set, using the program found in the appendix."
"Modern commercial organisations are facing pressures which have caused them
to lose personnel. When they lose people, they also lose their knowledge.
Organisations also have to cope with the internationalisation of business
forcing collaboration and knowledge sharing across time and distance. Knowledge
Management (KM) claims to tackle these issues. This paper looks at an area
where KM does not offer sufficient support, that is, the sharing of knowledge
that is not easy to articulate.
  The focus in this paper is on Communities of Practice in commercial
organisations. We do this by exploring knowledge sharing in Lave and Wenger's
[1] theory of Communities of Practice and investigating how Communities of
Practice may translate to a distributed international environment. The paper
reports on two case studies that explore the functioning of Communities of
Practice across international boundaries."
"With the current trends towards downsizing, outsourcing and globalisation,
modern organisations are reducing the numbers of people they employ. In
addition, organisations now have to cope with the increasing
internationalisation of business forcing collaboration and knowledge sharing
across time and distance simultaneously. There is a need for new ways of
thinking about how knowledge is shared in distributed groups. In this paper we
explore a relatively new approach to knowledge sharing using Lave and Wenger's
(1991) theory of Communities of Practice (CoPs). We investigate whether CoPs
might translate to a geographically distributed international environment
through a case study that explores the functioning of a CoP across national
boundaries."
"Personalization customizes information access. The PIPE (""Personalization is
Partial Evaluation"") modeling methodology represents interaction with an
information space as a program. The program is then specialized to a user's
known interests or information seeking activity by the technique of partial
evaluation. In this paper, we elaborate PIPE by considering requirements
analysis in the personalization lifecycle. We investigate the use of scenarios
as a means of identifying and analyzing personalization requirements. As our
first result, we show how designing a PIPE representation can be cast as a
search within a space of PIPE models, organized along a partial order. This
allows us to view the design of a personalization system, itself, as
specialized interpretation of an information space. We then exploit the
underlying equivalence of explanation-based generalization (EBG) and partial
evaluation to realize high-level goals and needs identified in scenarios; in
particular, we specialize (personalize) an information space based on the
explanation of a user scenario in that information space, just as EBG
specializes a theory based on the explanation of an example in that theory. In
this approach, personalization becomes the transformation of information spaces
to support the explanation of usage scenarios. An example application is
described."
"We describe a method for text entry based on inverse arithmetic coding that
relies on gaze direction and which is faster and more accurate than using an
on-screen keyboard.
  These benefits are derived from two innovations: the writing task is matched
to the capabilities of the eye, and a language model is used to make
predictable words and phrases easier to write."
"In addition to providing information to individual visitors, electronic
guidebooks have the potential to facilitate social interaction between visitors
and their companions. However, many systems impede visitor interaction. By
contrast, our electronic guidebook, Sotto Voce, has social interaction as a
primary design goal. The system enables visitors to share audio information -
specifically, they can hear each other's guidebook activity using a
technologically mediated audio eavesdropping mechanism. We conducted a study of
visitors using Sotto Voce while touring a historic house. The results indicate
that visitors are able to use the system effectively, both as a conversational
resource and as an information appliance. More surprisingly, our results
suggest that the technologically mediated audio often cohered the visitors'
conversation and activity to a far greater degree than audio delivered through
the open air."
"A novel algorithm for creating a mathematical model of curved shapes is
introduced. The core of the algorithm is based on building a graph
representation of the contoured image, which occupies less storage space than
produced by raster compression techniques. Different advanced applications of
the mathematical model are discussed: recognition of handwritten characters and
verification of handwritten text and signatures for authentification purposes.
Reducing the storage requirements due to the efficient mathematical model
results in faster retrieval and processing times. The experimental outcomes in
compression of contoured images and recognition of handwritten numerals are
given."
"This paper presents a mobile audio space intended for use by gelled social
groups. In face-to-face interactions in such social groups, conversational
floors change frequently, e.g., two participants split off to form a new
conversational floor, a participant moves from one conversational floor to
another, etc. To date, audio spaces have provided little support for such
dynamic regroupings of participants, either requiring that the participants
explicitly specify with whom they wish to talk or simply presenting all
participants as though they are in a single floor. By contrast, the audio space
described here monitors participant behavior to identify conversational floors
as they emerge. The system dynamically modifies the audio delivered to each
participant to enhance the salience of the participants with whom they are
currently conversing. We report a user study of the system, focusing on
conversation analytic results."
"The paper presents the ""Event Display"" package for the STAR offline
production as a special visualization tool to debug the reconstruction code.
This can be achieved if an author of the algorithm / code may build his/her own
custom Event Display alone from the base software blocks and re-used some
well-designed, easy to learn user-friendly patterns. For STAR offline
production Event Display ROOT with Qt lower level interface was chosen as the
base tools."
"The problem of how people find information is studied extensively; however,
the problem of how people organize, re-use, and re-find information that they
have found is not as well understood. Recently, several projects have conducted
in-situ studies to explore how people re-find and re-use information. Here, we
present results and observations from a controlled, laboratory study of
refinding information found on the web.
  Our study was conducted as a collaborative exercise with pairs of
participants. One participant acted as a retriever, helping the other
participant re-find information by telephone. This design allowed us to gain
insight into the strategies that users employed to re-find information, and
into how domain artifacts and contextual information were used to aid the
re-finding process. We also introduced the ability for users to add their own
explicitly artifacts in the form of making annotations on the web pages they
viewed.
  We observe that re-finding often occurs as a two stage, iterative process in
which users first attempt to locate an information source (search), and once
found, begin a process to find the specific information being sought (browse).
Our findings are consistent with research on waypoints; orienteering approaches
to re-finding; and navigation of electronic spaces. Furthermore, we observed
that annotations were utilized extensively, indicating that explicitly added
context by the user can play an important role in re-finding."
"We present the WebTeach project, formed by a web interface to database for

"Interfaces that support multi-lingual content can reach a broader community.
We wish to extend the reach of CITIDEL, a digital library for computing
education materials, to support multiple languages. By doing so, we hope that
it will increase the number of users, and in turn the number of resources. This
paper discusses three approaches to translation (automated translation,
developer-based, and community-based), and a brief evaluation of these
approaches. It proposes a design for an online community translation center
where volunteers help translate interface components and educational materials
available in CITIDEL."
"We present the first study to explore the use of out-of-turn interaction in
websites. Out-of-turn interaction is a technique which empowers the user to
supply unsolicited information while browsing. This approach helps flexibly
bridge any mental mismatch between the user and the website, in a manner
fundamentally different from faceted browsing and site-specific search tools.
We built a user interface (Extempore) which accepts out-of-turn input via voice
or text; and employed it in a US congressional website, to determine if users
utilize out-of-turn interaction for information-finding tasks, and their
rationale for doing so. The results indicate that users are adept at discerning
when out-of-turn interaction is necessary in a particular task, and actively
interleaved it with browsing. However, users found cascading information across
information-finding subtasks challenging. Therefore, this work not only
improves our understanding of out-of-turn interaction, but also suggests
further opportunities to enrich browsing experiences for users."

"Mobile access to information is a considerable problem for many users,
especially to information found on the Web. In this paper, we explore how a
voice-controlled service, accessible by telephone, could support mobile users'
needs for refinding specific information previously found on the Web. We
outline challenges in creating such a service and describe architectural and
user interfaces issues discovered in an exploratory prototype we built called
WebContext.
  We also present the results of a study, motivated by our experience with
WebContext, to explore what people remember about information that they are
trying to refind and how they express information refinding requests in a
collaborative conversation. As part of the study, we examine how
end-usercreated Web page annotations can be used to help support mobile
information re-finding. We observed the use of URLs, page titles, and
descriptions of page contents to help identify waypoints in the search process.
Furthermore, we observed that the annotations were utilized extensively,
indicating that explicitly added context by the user can play an important role
in re-finding."
"The global audience for software products includes members of different
countries, religions, and cultures: people who speak different languages, have
different life styles, and have different perceptions and expectations of any
given product. A major impediment in interface development is that there is
inadequate empirical evidence for the effects of culture in the usability
engineering methods used for developing user interfaces. This paper presents a
controlled study investigating the effects of culture on the effectiveness of
structured interviews in usability testing. The experiment consisted of
usability testing of a website with two independent groups of Indian
participants by two interviewers; one belonging to the Indian culture and the
other to the Anglo-American culture. Participants found more usability problems
and made more suggestions to an interviewer who was a member of the same
(Indian) culture than to the foreign (Anglo-American) interviewer. The results
of the study empirically establish that culture significantly affects the
efficacy of structured interviews during international user testing. The
implications of this work for usability engineering are discussed."
"An application is a logical image of the world on a computer. A scalable
application is an application that allows one to update that logical image at
run time. To put it in operational terms: an application is scalable if a
client can change between time T1 and time T2 - the logic of the application as
expressed by language L;
  - the structure and volume of the stored knowledge;
  - the user interface of the application; while clients working with the
application at time T1 will work with the changed application at time T2
without performing any special action between T1 and T2. In order to realize
such a scalable application a new architecture has been developed that fully
orbits around language. In order to verify the soundness of that architecture a
program has been build. Both architecture and program are called CommunSENS.
The main purpose of this paper is: - to list the relevant elements of the
architecture; - to give a visual presentation of how the program and its image
of the world look like; - to give a visual presentation of how the image can be
updated. Some relevant philosophical and practical backgrounds are included in
the appendixes."
"This paper gives an overview of the assessment and evaluation methods which
have been used to determine the quality of the INSPIRE smart home system. The
system allows different home appliances to be controlled via speech, and
consists of speech and speaker recognition, speech understanding, dialogue
management, and speech output components. The performance of these components
is first assessed individually, and then the entire system is evaluated in an
interaction experiment with test users. Initial results of the assessment and
evaluation are given, in particular with respect to the transmission channel
impact on speech and speaker recognition, and the assessment of speech output
for different system metaphors."
"System administration is a difficult, often tedious, job requiring many
skilled laborers. The data that is protected by system administrators is often
valued at or above the value of the institution maintaining that data. A number
of ethnographic studies have confirmed the skill of these operators, and the
difficulty of providing adequate tools. In an effort to minimize the
maintenance costs, an increasing portion of system administration is subject to
automation - particularly simple, routine tasks such as data backup. While such
tools reduce the risk of errors from carelessness, the same tools may result in
reduced skill and system familiarity in experienced workers. Care should be
taken to ensure that operators maintain system awareness without placing the
operator in a passive, monitoring role."
"The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used in introductory Computer
Science to teach basic object-oriented design. However, there appears to be a
lack of suitable software to support this task. Many of the available programs
that support UML focus on developing code and not on enhancing learning. Those
that were designed for educational use sometimes have poor interfaces or are
missing common and important features, such as multiple selection and
undo/redo. There is a need for software that is tailored to an instructional
environment and has all the useful and needed functionality for that specific
task. This is the purpose of minimUML. minimUML provides a minimum amount of
UML, just what is commonly used in beginning programming classes, while
providing a simple, usable interface. In particular, minimUML was designed to
support abstract design while supplying features for exploratory learning and
error avoidance. In addition, it allows for the annotation of diagrams, through
text or freeform drawings, so students can receive feedback on their work.
minimUML was developed with the goal of supporting ease of use, supporting
novice students, and a requirement of no prior-training for its use."
"The general set of HCI and Educational principles are considered and a
classification system constructed. A frequency analysis of principles is used
to obtain the most significant set. Metrics are devised to provide objective
measures of these principles and a consistent testing regime devised. These
principles are used to analyse Blackboard and Moodle."
"To transcribe speech, automatic speech recognition systems use statistical
methods, particularly hidden Markov model and N-gram models. Although these
techniques perform well and lead to efficient systems, they approach their
maximum possibilities. It seems thus necessary, in order to outperform current
results, to use additional information, especially bound to language. However,
introducing such knowledge must be realized taking into account specificities
of spoken language (hesitations for example) and being robust to possible
misrecognized words. This document presents a state of the art of these
researches, evaluating the impact of the insertion of linguistic information on
the quality of the transcription."
"It is suggested that a new area of CSCR (Computer Supported Collaborative
Research) is distinguished from CSCW and CSCL and that the demarcation between

"This text analyses the papers accepted for the workshop ""Reuse of designs: an
interdisciplinary cognitive approach"". Several dimensions and questions
considered as important (by the authors and/or by us) are addressed: What about
the ""interdisciplinary cognitive"" character of the approaches adopted by the
authors? Is design indeed a domain where the use of CBR is particularly
suitable? Are there important distinctions between CBR and other approaches?
Which types of knowledge -other than cases- is being, or might be, used in CBR
systems? With respect to cases: are there different ""types"" of case and
different types of case use? which formats are adopted for their
representation? do cases have ""components""? how are cases organised in the case
memory? Concerning their retrieval: which types of index are used? on which
types of relation is retrieval based? how does one retrieve only a selected
number of cases, i.e., how does one retrieve only the ""best"" cases? which
processes and strategies are used, by the system and by its user? Finally, some
important aspects of CBR system development are shortly discussed: should CBR
systems be assistance or autonomous systems? how can case knowledge be
""acquired""? what about the empirical evaluation of CBR systems? The conclusion
points out some lacking points: not much attention is paid to the user, and few
papers have indeed adopted an interdisciplinary cognitive approach."
"The new social media sites - blogs, wikis, del.icio.us and Flickr, among
others - underscore the transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in
which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. The
photo-sharing site Flickr, for example, allows users to upload photographs,
view photos created by others, comment on those photos, etc. As is common to
other social media sites, Flickr allows users to designate others as
``contacts'' and to track their activities in real time. The contacts (or
friends) lists form the social network backbone of social media sites. We claim
that these social networks facilitate new ways of interacting with information,
e.g., through what we call social browsing. The contacts interface on Flickr
enables users to see latest images submitted by their friends. Through an
extensive analysis of Flickr data, we show that social browsing through the
contacts' photo streams is one of the primary methods by which users find new
images on Flickr. This finding has implications for creating personalized
recommendation systems based on the user's declared contacts lists."
"In this paper, we propose an automated evaluation metric for text entry. We
also consider possible improvements to existing text entry evaluation metrics,
such as the minimum string distance error rate, keystrokes per character, cost
per correction, and a unified approach proposed by MacKenzie, so they can
accommodate the special characteristics of Chinese text. Current methods lack
an integrated concern about both typing speed and accuracy for Chinese text
entry evaluation. Our goal is to remove the bias that arises due to human
factors. First, we propose a new metric, called the correction penalty (P),
based on Fitts' law and Hick's law. Next, we transform it into the approximate
amortized cost (AAC) of information theory. An analysis of the AAC of Chinese
text input methods with different context lengths is also presented."
"When will the Internet become aware of itself? In this note the problem is
approached by asking an alternative question: Can the Internet cope with
stress? By extrapolating the psychological difference between coping and
defense mechanisms a distributed software experiment is outlined which could
reject the hypothesis that the Internet is not a conscious entity."
"User's perception of product, by essence subjective, is a major topic in
marketing and industrial design. Many methods, based on users' tests, are used
so as to characterise this perception. We are interested in three main methods:
multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method, and preference mapping.
These methods are used to built a perceptual space, in order to position the
new product, to specify requirements by the study of user's preferences, to
evaluate some product attributes, related in particular to style (aesthetic).
These early stages of the design are primordial for a good orientation of the
project. In parallel, virtual reality tools and interfaces are more and more
efficient for suggesting to the user complex feelings, and creating in this way
various levels of perceptions. In this article, we present on an example the
use of multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method and preference
mapping for the subjective assessment of virtual products. These products,
which geometrical form is variable, are defined with a CAD model and are
proposed to the user with a spacemouse and stereoscopic glasses. Advantages and
limitations of such evaluation is next discussed.."
"Today's computer-based annotation systems implement a wide range of
functionalities that often go beyond those available in traditional
paper-and-pencil annotations. Conceptually, annotation systems are based on
thoroughly investigated psycho-sociological and pedagogical learning theories.
They offer a huge diversity of annotation types that can be placed in textual
as well as in multimedia format. Additionally, annotations can be published or
shared with a group of interested parties via well-organized repositories.
Although highly sophisticated annotation systems exist both conceptually as
well as technologically, we still observe that their acceptance is somewhat
limited. In this paper, we argue that nowadays annotation systems suffer from
several fundamental problems that are inherent in the traditional
paper-and-pencil annotation paradigm. As a solution, we propose to shift the
annotation paradigm for the implementation of annotation system."
"Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique
where spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube. Fast and correct
analysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social
visualization applications. Information visualization researchers have
previously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in
revealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument
is based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed
simultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other
representations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time
cube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has
not been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a
between-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response
times when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a
baseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were
lower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the
participants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of
the dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as
fast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.
These results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space
time cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal
patterns."

"This chapter will survey pervasive computing with a look at how its
constraint for transparency affects issues of resource management and security.
The goal of pervasive computing is to render computing transparent, such that
computing resources are ubiquitously offered to the user and services are
proactively performed for a user without his or her intervention. The task of
integrating computing infrastructure into everyday life without making it
excessively invasive brings about tradeoffs between flexibility and robustness,
efficiency and effectiveness, as well as autonomy and reliability. As the
feasibility of ubiquitous computing and its real potential for mass
applications are still a matter of controversy, this chapter will look into the
underlying issues of resource management and authentication to discover how
these can be handled in a least invasive fashion. The discussion will be closed
by an overview of the solutions proposed by current pervasive computing
efforts, both in the area of generic platforms and for dedicated applications
such as pervasive education and healthcare."
"Among the multiple causes of high error rates in spreadsheets, lack of proper
training and of deep understanding of the computational model upon which
spreadsheet computations rest might not be the least issue. The paper addresses
this problem by presenting a didactical model focussing on cell interaction,
thus exceeding the atomicity of cell computations. The approach is motivated by
an investigation how different spreadsheet systems handle certain computational
issues implied from moving cells, copy-paste operations, or recursion."
"I revisit some classic publications on modularity, to show what problems its
pioneers wanted to solve. These problems occur with spreadsheets too: to
recognise them may help us avoid them."
"I describe preliminary experiments in documenting Excelsior versions of
spreadsheets using semantic wikis and literate programming. The objective is to
create well-structured and comprehensive documentation, easy to use by those
unfamiliar with the spreadsheets documented. I discuss why so much
documentation is hard to use, and briefly explain semantic wikis and literate
programming; although parts of the paper are Excelsior-specific, these sections
may be of more general interest."
"Very little is known about the process by which end-user developers detect
and correct spreadsheet errors. Any research pertaining to the development of
spreadsheet testing methodologies or auditing tools would benefit from
information on how end-users perform the debugging process in practice.
Thirteen industry-based professionals and thirty-four accounting & finance
students took part in a current ongoing experiment designed to record and
analyse end-user behaviour in spreadsheet error detection and correction.
Professionals significantly outperformed students in correcting certain error
types. Time-based cell activity analysis showed that a strong correlation
exists between the percentage of cells inspected and the number of errors
corrected. The cell activity data was gathered through a purpose written VBA
Excel plug-in that records the time and detail of all cell selection and cell
change actions of individuals."
"Most spreadsheet surveys both for reporting use and error focus on the
practical application of the spreadsheet in a particular industry. Typically
these studies will illustrate that a particular percentage of spreadsheets are
used for optimisation and a further percentage are used for 'What if' analysis.
Much less common is examining the classes of function, as defined by the
vendor, used by modellers to build their spreadsheet models. This alternative
analysis allows further insight into the programming nature of spreadsheets and
may assist researchers in targeting particular structures in spreadsheet
software for further investigation. Further, understanding the functional
make-up of spreadsheets allows effective evaluation of novel approaches from a
programming point of view. It allows greater insight into studies that report
what spreadsheets are used for since it is explicit which functional structures
are in use in spreadsheets. We conclude that a deeper understanding of the use
of operators and the operator's relationship to error would provide fresh
insight into the spreadsheet error problem. Considering functional spreadsheet
operator usage suggests the value of Example Driven Modelling for Decision
Support Systems"
"This study examines the differences between Scopus and Web of Science in the
citation counting, citation ranking, and h-index of 22 top human-computer
interaction (HCI) researchers from EQUATOR--a large British Interdisciplinary
Research Collaboration project. Results indicate that Scopus provides
significantly more coverage of HCI literature than Web of Science, primarily
due to coverage of relevant ACM and IEEE peer-reviewed conference proceedings.
No significant differences exist between the two databases if citations in
journals only are compared. Although broader coverage of the literature does
not significantly alter the relative citation ranking of individual
researchers, Scopus helps distinguish between the researchers in a more nuanced
fashion than Web of Science in both citation counting and h-index. Scopus also
generates significantly different maps of citation networks of individual
scholars than those generated by Web of Science. The study also presents a
comparison of h-index scores based on Google Scholar with those based on the
union of Scopus and Web of Science. The study concludes that Scopus can be used
as a sole data source for citation-based research and evaluation in HCI,
especially if citations in conference proceedings are sought and that h scores
should be manually calculated instead of relying on system calculations."
"Research on formulae production in spreadsheets has established the practice
as high risk yet unrecognised as such by industry. There are numerous software
applications that are designed to audit formulae and find errors. However these
are all post creation, designed to catch errors before the spreadsheet is
deployed. As a general conclusion from EuSpRIG 2003 conference it was decided
that the time has come to attempt novel solutions based on an understanding of
human factors. Hence in this paper we examine one such possibility namely a
novel example driven modelling approach. We discuss a control experiment that
compares example driven modelling against traditional approaches over several
progressively more difficult tests. The results are very interesting and
certainly point to the value of further investigation of the example driven
potential. Lastly we propose a method for statistically analysing the problem
of overconfidence in spreadsheet modellers."
"In this paper we consider human factors and their impact on spreadsheet
development in strategic decision-making. This paper brings forward research
from many disciplines both directly related to spreadsheets and a broader

consequences are."
"In this paper, we firstly present what is Interactive Evolutionary
Computation (IEC) and rapidly how we have combined this artificial intelligence
technique with an eye-tracker for visual optimization. Next, in order to
correctly parameterize our application, we present results from applying data

about 80 human individuals."
"A new MS Excel application has been developed which seeks to reduce the risks
associated with the development, operation and auditing of Excel spreadsheets.
FormulaDataSleuth provides a means of checking spreadsheet formulas and data as
they are developed or used, enabling the users to identify actual or potential
errors quickly and thereby halt their propagation. In this paper, we will
describe, with examples, how the application works and how it can be applied to
reduce the risks associated with Excel spreadsheets."
"Because spreadsheets have a large and growing importance in real-world work,
their contents need to be controlled and validated. Generally spreadsheets have
been difficult to verify, since data and executable information are stored
together. Spreadsheet applications with multiple authors are especially
difficult to verify, since controls over access are difficult to enforce.
Facing similar problems, traditional software engineering has developed
numerous tools and methodologies to control, verify and audit large
applications with multiple developers. We present some tools we have developed
to enable 1) the audit of selected, filtered, or all changes in a spreadsheet,
that is, when a cell was changed, its original and new contents and who made
the change, and 2) control of access to the spreadsheet file(s) so that
auditing is trustworthy. Our tools apply to OpenOffice.org calc spreadsheets,
which can generally be exchanged with Microsoft Excel."
"Accuracy in spreadsheet modelling systems can be reduced due to difficulties
with the inputs, the model itself, or the spreadsheet implementation of the
model. When the ""true"" outputs from the system are unknowable, accuracy is
evaluated subjectively. Less than perfect accuracy can be acceptable depending
on the purpose of the model, problems with inputs, or resource constraints.
Users build modelling systems iteratively, and choose to allocate limited
resources to the inputs, the model, the spreadsheet implementation, and to
employing the system for business analysis. When making these choices, users
can suffer from expectation bias and diagnosis bias. Existing research results
tend to focus on errors in the spreadsheet implementation. Because industry has
tolerance for system inaccuracy, errors in spreadsheet implementations may not
be a serious concern. Spreadsheet productivity may be of more interest."
"We present AceWiki, a prototype of a new kind of semantic wiki using the
controlled natural language Attempto Controlled English (ACE) for representing
its content. ACE is a subset of English with a restricted grammar and a formal
semantics. The use of ACE has two important advantages over existing semantic
wikis. First, we can improve the usability and achieve a shallow learning
curve. Second, ACE is more expressive than the formal languages of existing
semantic wikis. Our evaluation shows that people who are not familiar with the
formal foundations of the Semantic Web are able to deal with AceWiki after a
very short learning phase and without the help of an expert."
"AceWiki is a prototype that shows how a semantic wiki using controlled
natural language - Attempto Controlled English (ACE) in our case - can make
ontology management easy for everybody. Sentences in ACE can automatically be
translated into first-order logic, OWL, or SWRL. AceWiki integrates the OWL
reasoner Pellet and ensures that the ontology is always consistent. Previous
results have shown that people with no background in logic are able to add
formal knowledge to AceWiki without being instructed or trained in advance."
"The concept of metaphor, in particular graphical (or visual) metaphor, is
central to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and
interactive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical
devices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise
difficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This
paper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the
theory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many
information graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively
entrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to
structure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical
projection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with
phenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on
previous research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of
their target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke
these preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of
structural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding
image schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,
image schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework
for visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,
and discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of
information graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image
schemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory
of design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new
information visualization techniques."
"In this paper, we report on findings from an ethnographic study of how people
use their calendars for personal information management (PIM). Our participants
were faculty, staff and students who were not required to use or contribute to
any specific calendaring solution, but chose to do so anyway. The study was
conducted in three parts: first, an initial survey provided broad insights into
how calendars were used; second, this was followed up with personal interviews
of a few participants which were transcribed and content-analyzed; and third,
examples of calendar artifacts were collected to inform our analysis. Findings
from our study include the use of multiple reminder alarms, the reliance on
paper calendars even among regular users of electronic calendars, and wide use
of calendars for reporting and life-archival purposes. We conclude the paper
with a discussion of what these imply for designers of interactive calendar
systems and future work in PIM research."
"We demonstrate AceWiki that is a semantic wiki using the controlled natural
language Attempto Controlled English (ACE). The goal is to enable easy creation
and modification of ontologies through the web. Texts in ACE can automatically
be translated into first-order logic and other languages, for example OWL.
Previous evaluation showed that ordinary people are able to use AceWiki without
being instructed."
"This paper contributes to the human-machine interface community in two ways:
as a critique of the closed-loop AC (augmented cognition) approach, and as a
way to introduce concepts from complex systems and systems physiology into the
field. Of particular relevance is a comparison of the inverted-U (or Gaussian)
model of optimal performance and multidimensional fitness landscape model.
Hypothetical examples will be given from human physiology and learning and
memory. In particular, a four-step model will be introduced that is proposed as
a better means to characterize multivariate systems during behavioral processes
with complex dynamics such as learning. Finally, the alternate approach
presented herein is considered as a preferable design alternate in
human-machine systems. It is within this context that future directions are
discussed."
"This paper is a management summary of how the area of End User Computing
(EUC) has been addressed by AIB Capital Markets. The development of an
effective policy is described, as well as the process by which a register of
critical EUC applications was assembled and how those applications were brought
into a controlled environment. A number of findings are included as well as
recommendations for others who would seek to run a similar project."
"This paper presents the online AnAmeter framework that helps characterize the
different types of adaptations a system features by helping the evaluator fill
in a simple form. The provided information is then processed to obtain a
quantitative evaluation of three parameters called global, semi-global and
local adaptation degrees. By characterizing and quantifying adaptation,
AnAmeter provides the first steps towards the evaluation of the quality of a
system's adaptation. AnAmeter is an open tool available as freeware on the web
and has been applied to a selection of well known systems. To build this
evaluation grid we also collected a number of systems that cover the full range
of adaptation types."
"We present here a pattern sensitive PowerPoint presentation scheme. The
presentation is actuated by simple patterns drawn on the presentation screen by
a laser pointer. A specific pattern corresponds to a particular command
required to operate the presentation. Laser spot on the screen is captured by a
RGB webcam with a red filter mounted, and its location is identified at the
blue layer of each captured frame by estimating the mean position of the pixels
whose intensity is above a given threshold value. Measured Reliability,
Accuracy and Latency of our system are 90%, 10 pixels (in the worst case) and
38 ms respectively."
"User-driven applications belong to the new type of programs, in which users
get the full control of WHAT, WHEN, and HOW must appear on the screen. Such
programs can exist only if the screen view is organized not according with the
predetermined scenario, written by the developers, but if any screen object can
be moved, resized, and reconfigured by any user at any moment. This article
describes the algorithm, by which an object of an arbitrary shape can be turned
into moveable and resizable. It also explains some rules of such design and the
technique, which can be useful in many cases. Both the individual movements of
objects and their synchronous movements are analysed. After discussing the
individually moveable controls, different types of groups are analysed and the
arbitrary grouping of controls is considered."
"In this contribution, we propose a new framework to evaluate pedestrian
simula-tions by using Extended Range Telepresence. Telepresence is used as a
virtual reality walking simulator, which provides the user with a realistic
impression of being present and walking in a virtual environment that is much
larger than the real physical environment, in which the user actually walks.
The validation of the simulation is performed by comparing motion data of the
telepresent user with simulated data at some points of the simulation. The use
of haptic feedback from the simulation makes the framework suitable for
training in emergency situations."
"The search task and the system both affect the demand on cognitive resources
during information search. In some situations, the demands may become too high
for a person. This article has a three-fold goal. First, it presents and
critiques methods to measure cognitive load. Second, it explores the
distribution of load across search task stages. Finally, it seeks to improve
our understanding of factors affecting cognitive load levels in information
search. To this end, a controlled Web search experiment with forty-eight
participants was conducted. Interaction logs were used to segment search tasks
semi-automatically into task stages. Cognitive load was assessed using a new
variant of the dual-task method. Average cognitive load was found to vary by
search task stages. It was significantly higher during query formulation and
user description of a relevant document as compared to examining search results
and viewing individual documents. Semantic information shown next to the search
results lists in one of the studied interfaces was found to decrease mental
demands during query formulation and examination of the search results list.
These findings demonstrate that changes in dynamic cognitive load can be
detected within search tasks. Dynamic assessment of cognitive load is of core
interest to information science because it enriches our understanding of
cognitive demands imposed on people engaged in the search process by a task and
the interactive information retrieval system employed."
"With an historical point of view combined with a bibliographic overview, the
article discusses the idea that haptic force feedback transducers correspond
with a paradigm shift in our real-time tools for creating music. So doing, il
shows that computer music may be regarded as a major field of research and
application for haptics."
"A system and method for enabling human beings to communicate by way of their
monitored brain activity. The brain activity of an individual is monitored and
transmitted to a remote location (e.g. by satellite). At the remote location,
the monitored brain activity is compared with pre-recorded normalized brain
activity curves, waveforms, or patterns to determine if a match or substantial
match is found. If such a match is found, then the computer at the remote
location determines that the individual was attempting to communicate the word,
phrase, or thought corresponding to the matched stored normalized signal."
"This article describes the accurateness of our application namely
Self-Developed Aesthetics Measurement Application (SDA) in measuring the
aesthetics aspect by comparing the results of our application and users'
perceptions in measuring the aesthetics of the web page interfaces. For this
research, the positions of objects, images element and texts element are
defined as objects in a web page interface. Mandarin learning web pages are
used in this research. These learning web pages comprised of main pages,
learning pages and exercise pages, on the first author's E-portfolio web site.
The objects of the web pages were manipulated in order to produce the desired
aesthetic values. The six aesthetics related elements used are balance,
equilibrium, symmetry, sequence, rhythm, as well as order and complexity.
Results from the research showed that the ranking of the aesthetics values of
the web page interfaces measured of the users were congruent with the expected
perceptions of our designed Mandarin learning web page interfaces (reported
also in [18]). Thus, it implies that the subjectivity of aesthetics can be
measured in an objective manner. For further understanding on our effort in
doing aesthetics measurement, we discussed in details the object modelling used
as well as the process in developing this application. We also explained the
steps on how to run our application. Additionally, the strength and the
weakness of our SDA application shared in this paper suggest that there is
still room for the improvement for aesthetics measurement."
"Aesthetics of web page refers to how attractive a web page is in which it
catches the attention of the user to read through the information. In addition,
the visual appearance is important in getting attentions of the users.
Moreover, it was found that those screens, which were perceived as
aesthetically pleasing, were having a better usability. Usability might be a
strong basic in relating to the applicability for learning, and in this study
pertaining to Mandarin learning. It was also found that aesthetically pleasing
layouts of web page would motivate students in Mandarin learning The Mandarin
Learning web pages were manipulated according to the desired aesthetic
measurements. GUI aesthetic measuring method was used for this purpose. The
Aesthetics-Measurement Application (AMA) accomplished with six aesthetic
measures was developed and used. On top of it, questionnaires were distributed
to the users to gather information on the students' perceptions on the
aesthetic aspects and learning aspects. Respondents for this study were
students taking Mandarin course level I at UiTM Terengganu. A significant
correlation of the aesthetic aspect was found with its relevance to Mandarin
learning. In summary, aesthetics should not be ignored or overlooked in
designing effective learning interfaces for educational purposes."
"The relationship between physiological systems and modern electromechanical
technologies is fast becoming intimate with high degrees of complex
interaction. It can be argued that muscular function, limb movements, and touch
perception serve supervisory functions for movement control in motion and
touch-based (e.g. manipulable) devices/interfaces and human-machine interfaces
in general. To get at this hypothesis requires the use of novel techniques and
analyses which demonstrate the multifaceted and regulatory role of adaptive
physiological processes in these interactions. Neuromechanics is an approach
that unifies the role of physiological function, motor performance, and
environmental effects in determining human performance. A neuromechanical
perspective will be used to explain the effect of environmental fluctuations on
supervisory mechanisms, which leads to adaptive physiological responses. Three
experiments are presented using two different types of virtual environment that
allowed for selective switching between two sets of environmental forces. This
switching was done in various ways to maximize the variety of results.
Electromyography (EMG) and kinematic information contributed to the development
of human performance-related measures. Both descriptive and specialized
analyses were conducted: peak amplitude analysis, loop trace analysis, and the
analysis of unmatched muscle power. Results presented here provide a window
into performance under a range of conditions. These analyses also demonstrated
myriad consequences for force-related fluctuations on dynamic physiological
regulation. The findings presented here could be applied to the dynamic control
of touch-based and movement-sensitive human-machine systems. In particular, the
design of systems such as human-robotic systems, touch screen devices, and
rehabilitative technologies could benefit from this research."
"In today's world anybody who wants to access any information the first choice
is to use the web because it is the only source to provide easy and instant
access to information. However web readers face many hurdles from web which
includes load of web pages, text size, finding related information, spelling
and grammar etc. However understanding of web pages written in English language
creates great problems for non native readers who have basic knowledge of
English. In this paper, we propose a plain language for a local language (Urdu)
using English alphabets for web pages in Pakistan. For this purpose we
developed two websites, one with a normal English fonts and other in a local
language text scheme using English alphabets. We also conducted a questionnaire
from 40 different users with a different level of English language fluency in
Pakistan to gain the evidence of the practicality of our approach. The result
shows that the proposed plain language text scheme using English alphabets
improved the reading comprehension for non native English speakers in Pakistan."
"We present results from a longitudinal study of 34 iPh-one 3GS users, called
LiveLab. LiveLab collected unprecedented usage data through an in-device,
programmable logger and several structured interviews with the participants
throughout the study. We have four objectives in writing this paper: (i) share
the findings with the research community; (ii) provide insights guiding the
design of smartphone systems and applications; (iii) demonstrate the power of
prudently designed longitudinal field studies and the power of advanced
research methods; and (iv) raise important questions that the research
community can help answer in a collaborative, multidisciplinary manner.
  We show how the smartphone usage changes over the year and why the users are
different (and similar) in their usage. In particular, our findings highlight
application and web usage dynamics, the influence of socioeconomic status (SES)
on usage, and the shortcomings of iPhone 3GS and its ecosystem. We further show
that distinct classes of usage patterns exist, and these classes are best
served by different phone designs, instead of the one-size-fits-all phone Apple
provides. Our findings are significant not only for understanding smartphone
users but also in guiding device and application development and optimizations.
While we present novel results that can only be produced by a study of this
nature, we also raise new research questions to be investigated by the mobile
research community."
"A basic component in Internet applications is the electronic mail and its
various implications. The paper proposes a mechanism for automatically
classifying emails and create dynamic groups that belong to these messages.
Proposed mechanisms will be based on natural language processing techniques and
will be designed to facilitate human-machine interaction in this direction."
"Squiggle is a template-based glyph recognizer in the lineage of `$1
Recognizer' and `Protractor'. It seeks a good fit linear affine mapping between
the input and template glyphs which are represented as a list of milestone
points along the glyph path. The algorithm can recognize input glyphs invariant
of rotation, scaling, skew, and reflection symmetries. In practice the
algorithm is fast and robust enough to recognize user-generated glyphs as they
are being drawn in real time, and to project `shadows' of the matching
templates as feedback."
"The 3D4Amb project aims at developing a system based on the stereoscopic 3D
techonlogy, like the NVIDIA 3D Vision, for the diagnosis and treatment of
amblyopia in young children. It exploits the active shutter technology to
provide binocular vision, i.e. to show different images to the amblyotic (or
lazy) and the normal eye. It would allow easy diagnosis of amblyopia and its
treatment by means of interactive games or other entertainment activities. It
should not suffer from the compliance problems of the classical treatment, it
is suitable to domestic use, and it could at least partially substitute
occlusion or patching of the normal eye."
"3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an emerging field in image processing
and computer vision that aims to create 3D visualizations/ models of objects/
scenes from image sets. However, its commercial applications and benefits are
yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we describe ongoing work towards
assessing the value of 3D reconstruction in the building construction domain.
We present preliminary results from a user study, where our objective is to
understand the use of visual information in building construction in order to
determine problems with the use of visual information and identify potential
benefits and scenarios for the use of 3D reconstruction."
"Mobile learning (M-learning) is receiving more attention as a method of
delivering to learners study materials anytime and anywhere. It is a necessity
for educators to come up with a layout for learning that can be accessed
through mobile devices. These learning materials should consist of good quality
learning theories and accurate instructional layout in order to maintain the
learning as effective as possible. It is important to follow certain strategies
that can help the developers for M-learning applications. In this paper we
proposed a set of strategies that are useful for creating mobile prototype for
Computer Science and Engineering courses or M-learning application for course
content."
"We present a modular framework for articulatory animation synthesis using
speech motion capture data obtained with electromagnetic articulography (EMA).
Adapting a skeletal animation approach, the articulatory motion data is applied
to a three-dimensional (3D) model of the vocal tract, creating a portable
resource that can be integrated in an audiovisual (AV) speech synthesis
platform to provide realistic animation of the tongue and teeth for a virtual
character. The framework also provides an interface to articulatory animation
synthesis, as well as an example application to illustrate its use with a 3D
game engine. We rely on cross-platform, open-source software and open standards
to provide a lightweight, accessible, and portable workflow."
"Human computation refers to the outsourcing of computation tasks to human
workers. It offers a new direction for solving a variety of problems and calls
for innovative ways of managing human computation processes. The majority of
human computation tasks take a parallel approach, whereas the potential of an
iterative approach, i.e., having workers iteratively build on each other's
work, has not been sufficiently explored. This study investigates whether and
how human workers' awareness of previous workers' rationales affects the
performance of the iterative approach in a brainstorming task and a rating
task. Rather than viewing this work as a conclusive piece, the author believes
that this research endeavor is just the beginning of a new research focus that
examines and supports meta-cognitive processes in crowdsourcing activities."
"Automated generalisation has known important improvements these last few
years. However, an issue that still deserves more study concerns the automatic
evaluation of generalised data. Indeed, many automated generalisation systems
require the utilisation of an evaluation function to automatically assess
generalisation outcomes. In this paper, we propose a new approach dedicated to
the design of such a function. This approach allows an imperfectly defined
evaluation function to be revised through a man-machine dialogue. The user
gives its preferences to the system by comparing generalisation outcomes.
Machine Learning techniques are then used to improve the evaluation function.
An experiment carried out on buildings shows that our approach significantly
improves generalisation evaluation functions defined by users."
"We explore the design of a seamless broadcast communication system that
brings together the distributed community of remote secondary education
schools. In contrast to higher education, primary and secondary education
establishments should remain distributed, in order to maintain a balance of
urban and rural life in the developing and the developed world. We plan to
deploy an ambient and social interactive TV platform (physical installation,
authoring tools, interactive content) that supports social communication in a
positive way. In particular, we present the physical design and the conceptual
model of the system."
"Web applications need better user interface to be interactive and attractive.
A new approach/concept of dimensional enhancement - 2.5D ""a 2D display of a
