summary
"Technology designers often strive to design systems that are flexible enough
to be used in a wide range of situations. Software engineers, in particular,
are trained to seek general solutions to problems. General solutions can be
used not only to address the problem at hand, but also to address a wide range
of problems that the designers may not have even anticipated. Sometimes
designers wish to provide general solutions, while encouraging certain uses of
their technology and discouraging or precluding others. They may attempt to
influence the use of technology by ``hard-wiring'' it so that it only can be
used in certain ways, licensing it so that those who use it are legally
obligated to use it in certain ways, issuing guidelines for how it should be
used, or providing resources that make it easier to use the technology as the
designers intended than to use it in any other way.
  This paper examines several cases where designers have attempted to influence
the use of technology through one of these mechanisms. Such cases include key
recovery encryption, Pegasus Mail, Platform for Internet Content Selection
(PICS) Guidelines, Java, Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)
Implementation Guide, Apple's style guidelines, and Microsoft Foundation
Classes. In some of these cases, the designers sought to influence the use of
technology for competitive reasons or in order to promote standardization or
interoperability. However, in other cases designers were motivated by
policy-related goals such as protecting privacy or free speech. As new
technologies are introduced with the express purpose of advancing
policy-related goals (for example, PICS and P3P), it is especially important to
understand the roles designers might play in influencing the use of technology."
"In this work the impact of the Internet culture on standard mainstream
societies has been analyzed. After analytically establishing the fact that the
Net can be viewed as a pan-societal superstructure which supports its own
distinct culture, an ethnographic analysis is provided to find out the key
aspects of this culture. The elements of this culture which have an empowering
impacts on the standard mainstream societies, as well as the elements in it
which can cause discouraging social effects are then discussed by a global
investigation of the present status of various fundamental aspects (e,g,
education, economics, politics, entertainment etc) of the mainstream societies
as well as their links with the Net culture. Though immensely potential for
providing various prominent positive impacts, the key findings of this work
indicate that misuse of Internet can create tremendous harm to the members of
the mainstream societies by generating a set of morally crippled people as well
as a future generation completely void of principles and ethics. This
structured diagnostic approach to the social problems caused by the manhandling
of Internet leads to a concrete effort of providing the measures that can be
taken to enhance or to overcome the supporting and limiting effects of the Net
culture respectively with the intent to benefit our society and to protect the
teratoidation of certain ethical values."
"The shift towards the use of electronic media in scholarly communication
appears to be an inescapable imperative. However, these shifts are uneven, both
with respect to field and with respect to the form of communication. Different
scientific fields have developed and use distinctly different communicative
forums, both in the paper and electronic arenas, and these forums play
different communicative roles within the field. One common claim is that we are
in the early stages of an electronic revolution, that it is only a matter of
time before other fields catch up with the early adopters, and that all fields
converge on a stable set of electronic forums. A social shaping of technology
(SST) perspective helps us to identify important social forces centered around
disciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication that pull
against convergence. This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and
communicative heterogeneity are durable features of the scholarly landscape,
and that we are likely to see field differences in the use of and meaning
ascribed to communications forums persist, even as overall use of electronic
communications technologies both in science and in society as a whole
increases."
"A variety of tools have been introduced recently that are designed to help
people protect their privacy on the Internet. These tools perform many
different functions in-cluding encrypting and/or anonymizing communications,
preventing the use of persistent identifiers such as cookies, automatically
fetching and analyzing web site privacy policies, and displaying
privacy-related information to users. This paper discusses the set of privacy
tools that aim specifically at facilitating notice and choice about Web site
data practices. While these tools may also have components that perform other
functions such as encryption, or they may be able to work in conjunction with
other privacy tools, the primary pur-pose of these tools is to help make users
aware of web site privacy practices and to make it easier for users to make
informed choices about when to provide data to web sites. Examples of such
tools include the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and various
infomediary services."
"Collaboratories refer to laboratories where scientists can work together
while they are in distant locations from each other and from key equipment.
They have captured the interest both of CSCW researchers and of science funders
who wish to optimize the use of rare scientific equipment and expertise. We
examine the kind of CSCW conceptions that help us best understand the character
of working relationships in these scientific collaboratories. Our model,
inspired by actor-network theory, considers technologies as Socio-technical
Interaction Networks (STINs). This model provides a rich understanding of the
scientific collaboratories, and also a more complete understanding of the
conditions and activities that support collaborative work in them. We
illustrate the significance of STIN models with several cases drawn from the
fields of high energy physics and materials science."
"This paper examines the effect of ownership concentration on product
position, product variety and readership in markets for daily newspapers. US
antitrust policy presumes that mergers reduce the amount and diversity of
content available to consumers. However, the effects of consolidation in
differentiated product markets cannot be determined solely from theory. Because
multi-product firms internalize business stealing, mergers may encourage firms
to reposition products, leading to more, not less, variety. Using data on
reporter assignments from 1993-1999, results show that differentiation and
variety increase with concentration. Moreover, there is evidence that
additional variety increases readership, suggesting that concentration benefits
consumers."
"Recent trends reveal the search by companies for a legal hook to prevent the
undesired and unauthorized copying of information posted on websites. In the
center of this controversy are metasites, websites that display prices for a
variety of vendors. Metasites function by implementing shopbots, which extract
pricing data from other vendors' websites. Technological mechanisms have proved
unsuccessful in blocking shopbots, and in response, websites have asserted a
variety of legal claims. Two recent cases, which rely on the troublesome
trespass to chattels doctrine, suggest that contract law may provide a less
demanding legal method of preventing the search of websites by data robots. If
blocking collection of pricing data is as simple as posting an online contract,
the question arises whether this end result is desirable and legally viable."
"The popular conception is that data traffic nearly, if not already, exceeds
voice traffic on backbone networks. However, the results of research reported
in this paper imply that voice traffic greatly exceeds data traffic when real
users are asked to estimate their usage of a wide variety of media. Media usage
was surveyed for students in New York City and in Los Angeles. Other than
significant differences in radio listening, e-mails, and downloads, the usage
was quite similar. Telephone usage (wired and wireless) was nearly an hour per
day. When converted to bits, the telephone traffic was much greater than the
data traffic over the Internet. This paper reports on the details of the two
user studies. The traffic implications of the results are estimated. The
finding that voice exceeds data will then be reconciled with the popular
opposite conception."
"While the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires all incumbent local telephone
companies to cooperate with local entrants, section 271 of the Act provides the
Bell companies (but not GTE) additional incentives to cooperate. Using an
original data set, I compare the negotiations of AT&T, as a local entrant, with
GTE and with the Bell companies in states where both operate. My results
suggest that the differential incentives matter: The Bells accommodate entry
more than does GTE, as evidenced in quicker agreements, less litigation, and
more favorable prices offered for network access. Consistent with this, there
is more entry into Bell territories"
"Our goal is to distinguish between the following two hypotheses: (A) The
Internet will remain disproportionately in English and will, over time, cause
more people to learn English as second language and thus solidify the role of
English as a global language. This outcome will prevail even though there are
more native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English
speakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the
native languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power)
and will not promote English as a global language.
  English's ""early lead"" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are
not native English speakers frequently access the large number of English
language web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing
web sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their
sites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical
question, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not
English use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English
speakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data
set on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada
provides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the
two official languages.
  Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to
Internet use for French-speaking Quebecois. These preliminary results are
consistent with the scenario in which the Internet will promote English as a
global language."
"The unique challenge presented by the Internet is that compliance with local
laws is rarely sufficient to assure a business that it has limited its exposure
to legal risk. The paper identifies why the challenge of adequately accounting
for the legal risk arising from Internet jurisdiction has been aggravated in
recent years by the adoption of the Zippo legal framework, commonly referred to
as the passive versus active test. The test provides parties with only limited
guidance and often results in detrimental judicial decisions from a policy
perspective. Given the inadequacies of the Zippo passive versus active test,
the paper argues that it is now fitting to identify a more effective standard
for determining when it is appropriate to assert jurisdiction in cases
involving predominantly Internet-based contacts. The solution submitted in the
paper is to move toward a targeting-based analysis. Unlike the Zippo approach,
a targeting analysis would seek to identify the intentions of the parties and
to assess the steps taken to either enter or avoid a particular jurisdiction.
Targeting would also lessen the reliance on effects-based analysis, the source
of considerable uncertainty since Internet-based activity can ordinarily be
said to create some effects in most jurisdictions. To identify the appropriate
criteria for a targeting test, the paper recommends returning to the core
jurisdictional principle -- foreseeability. Foreseeability in the targeting
context depends on three factors -- contracts, technology, and actual or
implied knowledge."
"As far as many consumers and businessmen and women are concerned,
increasingly wireline and wireless services, including those provided by
terrestrial and satellite systems, are considered to be substitutes and
sometimes complements, regardless of the laws and regulations applicable to
them. At the same time, many writers and even government agencies (such as the
FCC) have suggested that users of the spectrum should be given more
property-like rights in the use of the spectrum and at a minimum should be
given much more flexibility in how they may use the spectrum. Two recent
developments have important implications with respect to ""convergence,""
spectrum property rights and flexible use of the spectrum. The first
development involves several proposals to provide terrestrial wireless services
within spectrum in use or planned to be used to provide satellite services. The
second development is the passage of the 2000 ORBIT Act which specifically
forbids the use of license auctions to select among mutually exclusive
applicants to provide international or global satellite communications service.
The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the questions raised by these
two events, but not necessarily to provide definitive answers or solutions."
"The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical name space that
enables the assignment of unique, mnemonic identifiers to Internet hosts and
the consistent mapping of these names to IP addresses. The root of the domain
name system is the top of the hierarchy and is currently managed by a
quasi-private centralized regulatory authority, the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This paper identifies and discusses the
economic and policy issues raised by competing DNS roots. The paper provides a
precise definition of root-competition and shows that multiple roots are a
species of standards competition, in which network externalities play a major
role. The paper performs a structural analysis of the different forms that
competing DNS roots can take and their effects on end-user compatibility. It
then explores the policy implications of the various forms of competition.
  The thesis of the paper is that root competition is caused by a severe
disjunction between the demand for and supply of top-level domain names. ICANN
has authorized a tiny number of new top-level domains (7) and subjected their
operators to excruciatingly slow and expensive contractual negotiations. The
growth of alternate DNS roots is an attempt to bypass that bottleneck. The
paper arrives at the policy conclusion that competition among DNS roots should
be permitted and is a healthy outlet for inefficiency or abuses of power by the
dominant root administrator."
"Drawing on perspectives from telecommunications policy and neo-Gramscian
understandings of international political economy, this paper offers an
explanation and analysis of the shifting patterns of regulation which have been
evident in the telecommunications sector in recent years. It aims to illustrate
explain and explore the implications of the movement of regulatory sovereignty
away from the nation-state, through regional conduits, to global organisations
in the crystallisation of a world system of telecommunications governance.
  Our central argument is that telecommunications governance has evolved from a
regulatory arena characterised, in large part, by national diversity, to one
wherein a more convergent global multilayered system is emerging. We suggest
that the epicentre of this regulatory system is the relatively new World Trade
Organisation (WTO). Working in concert with the WTO are existing
well-established nodes regulation. In further complement, we see regional
regulatory projects, notably the European Union (EU), as important conduits and
nodes of regulation in the consolidation of a global regulatory regime.
  By way of procedure, we first explore the utility of a neo-Gramscian approach
for understanding the development of global regulatory frameworks. Second, we
survey something of the recent history - and, in extension, conventional wisdom
- of telecommunications regulation at national and regional levels. Third, we
demonstrate how a multilayered system of global telecommunications regulation
has emerged centred around the regulatory authority of the WTO. Finally, we
offer our concluding comments."
"Our research, which began fielding surveys in 1995, and which have been
repeated with variation in 1996, 1997 and 2000, was apparently the first to use
national random telephone survey methods to track social and community aspects
of Internet use, and to compare users and non-users. It also seems to be among
the first that used these methods to compare users with non-users in regards to
communication, social and community issues. The work has been largely supported
by grants from the Markle Foundation of New York City as well as the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation.

"A dichotomy in regulatory treatment and corporate cultures exists between
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication carriers. Telephone
company executives (Bell Heads) may resent regulation, but they accept their
fate and work creatively to exploit anomalies and opportunities to secure a
regulation-conferred competitive advantage. Most ISP executives (Net Heads)
appear to embrace a libertarian attitude, strongly opposing any government
involvement. Despite the clash of cultures, the telecommunications and Internet
worlds have merged. Such convergence jeopardizes the ability of Net Heads to
avoid some degree of regulation, particularly when they offer services
functionally equivalent to what their Bell Head counterparts offer.
  This paper will assess the regulatory consequences when telecommunication and
Internet services converge in the marketplace and in terms of operating
technologies. The paper identifies commercial developments in the Internet to
support the view that the Internet has become more hierarchical and more like
telecommunication networks. The paper concludes that telecommunication carriers
will display superior skill in working the regulatory process to their
advantage. The paper suggests that Bell Heads will outmaneuver Net Heads
particularly when the revenue siphoning effect of Internet-mediated services
offsets the revenues generated from ISP leases of telecommunication
transmission capacity."
"This paper examines the relationship between changes in telecommunications
provider concentration on international long distance routes and changes in
prices on those routes. Overall, decreased concentration is associated with
significantly lower prices to consumers of long distance services. However, the
relationship between concentration and price varies according to the type of
long distance plan considered. For the international flagship plans frequently
selected by more price-conscious consumers of international long distance,
increased competition on a route is associated with lower prices. In contrast,
for the basic international plans that are the default selection for consumers,
increased competition on a route is actually associated with higher prices.
Thus, somewhat surprisingly, price dispersion appears to increase as
competition increases."
"Standard-setting organizations (SSOs) regularly encounter situations in which
one or more companies claim to own proprietary rights that cover a proposed
industry standard. The industry cannot adopt the standard without the
permission of the intellectual property owner (or owners).
  How SSOs respond to those who assert intellectual property rights is
critically important. Whether or not private companies retain intellectual
property rights in group standards will determine whether a standard is ""open""
or ""closed."" It will determine who can sell compliant products, and it may well
influence whether the standard adopted in the market is one chosen by a group
or one offered by a single company. SSO rules governing intellectual property
rights will also affect how standards change as technology improves.
  Given the importance of SSO rules governing intellectual property rights,
there has been surprisingly little treatment of SSOs or their intellectual
property rules in the legal literature. My aim in this article is to fill that
void. To do so, I have surveyed the intellectual property policies of dozens of
SSOs, primarily but not exclusively in the computer networking and
telecommunications industries."
"Successful achievement of public policies requires satisfaction of conditions
affecting political feasibility for policy adoption and maintenance as well as
economic viability of the desired activity or enterprise. This paper discusses
the difficulties of satisfying these joint constraints given the legacy of the
common law doctrines of ""just price"" and ""businesses affected with a public
interest."" In this regard, it is helpful to view traditional public utility
regulation as a form of welfare state regulation, as it suffers from similar
political problems from policy retrenchment. The retrenchment problems are
examined in the context of the electricity crisis in California as well as the
passage and implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As expected,
retrenchment from low residential retail rates - the most universalistic
benefit for customers - faces the greatest political resistance. The societal
trade-offs between monopoly and competition must be reexamined in light of the
greater instability and political difficulties under a deregulatory regime."
"In the pre-divestiture era, the regulatory environment in the U.S. was fairly
uniform and harmonious with the FCC setting the course and the accommodative
state PUCs making corresponding changes in their own policies. The divestiture
fractured this monolithic system as it forced the PUCs to respond to new forces
unleashed in their own backyards. Soon there was great diversity in the overall
regulatory landscape. Within this new environment, there is considerable
disparity among the PUCs in terms of their ability to implement new ideas. This
paper seeks to understand the structural factors that influence the latitude of
regulatory action by PUCs via a comparative study of local telephone
competition policy making in Arkansas and New York. The analysis suggests that
the presence or absence of countervailing forces determines the relative
autonomy the PUCs enjoy and thereby their ability to introduce new ideas into
their states."
"ENUM creates many new market opportunities and raises several important
policy issues related to the implementation and administration of the ENUM
database and services. Recent World Telecommunications Policy Forum 2001 dealt
with the emergence of ENUM as an important numbering issue of IP telephony.
This paper prepares some important emerging issues of ENUM administration and
policy by taking an empirical research approach from the bottom up.
  We will identify potential key ENUM services, and estimating the size of the
service market opportunities created by the availability of PSTN-IP addressing
and mapping mechanisms, particularly in the context of IP telephony. Also, we
analyze the possible administrative models and relationship scenarios among
different ENUM players such as Registry(ies), Registrars, Telephone Service
Providers, ENUM Application Service Providers, etc. Then, we will assess the
effects of various administrative model architectures of ENUM service by
looking at the market opportunities and motivations of the players. From the
empirical findings, we will draw the implications on transactions among
different kinds of ENUM service providers. Finally, the results of the model
analysis will be used for the discussion of policy related issues around the
ENUM and IP telephony services.

"Focusing on the telecom manufacturing industry in China, this paper contends
that the existing literature needs to be expanded in order to explain the
Chinese case. First, product cycle theory could be applied to explain
multinational corporations' strategies of importing and localizing their
products in China in order to take advantage of lower labor costs and often
more significantly to break barriers to the Chinese market. Second, there are
no significant indicators pointing to local multinational subsidiaries and
indigenous manufacturers serving as a substantial part of the cross-national
production networks in the global telecom industry yet, although there are some
signs of potential development. Third, the success of ""Wintelism"" and the
maturity of cross-national production networks in the global market have had
significant impacts on China's indigenous industry."
"While traditional radio stations are subject to extensive government
regulations, Internet radio stations remain largely unregulated. As Internet
radio usage has increased certain stakeholders have begun to argue that these
Internet radio broadcasters are providing significant and diverse programming
to American audiences and that government regulation of spectrum-using radio
station ownership may be further relaxed.
  One of the primary justifications for regulation of ownership has been to
protect diversity in broadcasting. This study hypothesizes that Internet radio
broadcasting does add diversity to the radio broadcasting industry and that it
should be considered as relevant by regulators.
  This study evaluates the role of Internet radio broadcasters according to
five criteria intended to gauge the level of diversity being delivered to
listeners online. By measuring the levels of format, channel, ownership,
location and language diversity among Internet radio stations, it is possible
to draw benchmark lessons about the new medium's ability to provide Americans
with diverse broadcasting options.
  The study finds that Internet radio broadcasters are in fact adding
measurable diversity to the radio broadcasting industry. Internet broadcasters
are providing audiences with access to an increasing number of stations,
owners, formats, and language choices, and it is likely that technologies
aiding in the mobility of access as well as broadband evolution will reinforce
these findings."
"South Africa adopted the GATS Basic Agreement on Telecommunications and the
regulatory principles in 1998. Obligations undertaken by South Africa mirrored
the framework for the gradual telecommunications reform process that was begun
in 1996. In the light of two threatened actions for anti-competitive practices
in violation of the Agreement, this paper reviews the nature of the commitments
undertaken by South Africa and assesses the country's compliance to date. This
paper also seeks to explore the tension that arises between domestic policy
reforms and international trade aspirations. It is argued that the dynamic
produced through this tension affords domestic governments a mechanism with
which to balance the seemingly opposing goals of competition and development.
It is further argued that the broad regulatory principles, adopted by all
signatories and often criticized for lack of precision, facilitate this fine
balancing and affords domestic governments an opportunity to advance sovereign
concerns while pursuing international trade ideals."
"In asserting a competitive market environment as a justification for
regulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated
a clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, one of the most
protean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however,
inhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public
and regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger as an example of the way
in which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant
to communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses
interpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes
that the Telecom Act's goal of fostering economic competition among information
service providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships
and behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity
for untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the
social phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and
commons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in
policy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property."
"Many people expect the Internet to change American politics, most likely in
the direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government
officials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California
initiative with these objectives would authorize use of encrypted digital
signatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other
ballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will
significantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the
influence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it
will increase both public participation in the political process and public
understanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether
Internet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the
measure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.
Beyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the
effects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage
greater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or
would it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current
problems with the initiative process itself? Because we lack good data on these
questions, answers to them today are largely conjectural. We can be fairly
sure, however, that Internet petition signing, like Internet voting, will have
unintended consequences."
"A critical element of most national telecom policy objectives is advancing
universal service. In a multi-operator context, this is usually operationalized
through Universal Service Obligations (USO), by which various operators are
mandated to provide a part of their services to rural areas or to high cost to
serve customers at ""affordable"" prices.
  This paper highlights the various issues in USO from a developing country
perspective. The first part of this paper gives an overview of USO practices
and issues. The second part reviews the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's
recommendations on USO cost estimation. In the third part, the paper analyzes
characteristics of rural exchanges with a view to evolve a framework for
assessing USO. This framework is applicable to developing countries as the
study carried out in this paper is in the context of a developing country
characterized by low telecom penetration and non-availability of data with
regulators."
"Internet technology should eventually provide important improvements over
established media not only in the efficiency of broadband delivery, and of
particularimportance, in the efficiency of business models that can be used to
collect money for that programming. I identify five economic characteristics of
Internet technology that should lead to these greater efficiencies: (1) lower
delivery costs and reduced capacity constraints, (2) more efficient
interactivity, (3) more efficient advertising and sponsorship, (4) more
efficient direct pricing and bundling, and (5) lower costs of copying and
sharing.
  The most successful Internet TV business models are likely to involve
syndication to or from other media, and also international distribution. In the
broader context, Internet TV is another syndication outlet by which program
suppliers can segment their overall markets and thus support higher production
investments. Many innovative and more sharply focused programs will surely
prosper on Internet TV, but the attractiveness to audiences of high production
value programming will tend to advantage broad appeal programming, such as
Hollywood movies. Historical evidence about the performance of cable television
and videocassettes is presented to support these points."
"This paper develops a theoretical perspective on globalization and the
Information Society and combines it with a critical usage of international
regime theory as a heuristic for understanding the current historical period of
transition from an international telecommunicaitons regime (Cowhey, 1990; 1994)
to a new and complex regime aimed at providing governance for the Global
Information Infrastructure and Global Information Society (GII/GIS). In
analyzing the principles, values, norms, rules, collective decision-making
prdocedures, and enforcement mechanisms of the emergent GII/GIS regime, this
paper differentiates between three regime levels: (1) Macro-Regime--global; (2)
Mezzo-Regime--regional and sub-regional; and (3) Micro-Regime--national. The
paper employs a case-study approach to explore some of the specific national
responses (i.e. South Africa) to this regime transition, with an analysis of
potential best practices and lessons learned for other emerging economies. Key
findings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic,
and technological factors are eroding the existing international
telecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate
restructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new
regime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is
being driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by
the more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related
to global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at
national, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition
in both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative
response, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime."
"Consumers value keeping some information about them private from potential
marketers. E-commerce dramatically increases the potential for marketers to
accumulate otherwise private information about potential customers. Online
marketers claim that this information enables them to better market their
products. Policy makers are currently drafting rules to regulate the way in
which these marketers can collect, store, and share this information. However,
there is little evidence yet either of consumers' valuation of their privacy or
of the benefits they might reap through better target marketing. We provide a
framework for measuring a portion of the benefits from allowing marketers to
make better use of consumer information. Target marketing is likely to reduce
consumer search costs, improve consumer product selection decisions, and lower
the marketing costs of goods sold. Our model allows us to estimate the value to
consumers of only the latter, price reductions from more efficient marketing."
"E-Commerce challenges traditional approaches to assessing monopolistic
practices due to the rapid rate of growth, rapid change in technology,
difficulty in assessing market share for information products like web sites,
and high degree of interconnectivity and alliance formation among corporations.
This paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and
economic perspective to the search engine market.
  The findings indicate that (1) despite an increasing number of search
engines, barriers to entry seem high, largely due to the exponential growth in
the number of web sites and the non-scalability of the current search
technology and collective switching costs; (2) older search engine sites tend
typically to have more features to lock in users. Using standard economic
indicators (CR4=58% and HHI=1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by
anticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in
this paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern.
  Based on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other
possible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some
search engines keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The
trend shows that some search engines may dominate the search engine market. We
suggest conducting research in the coverage performance of search engines and
investigate ""information search cost"" as a performance indicator of search
techniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive
conduct (e.g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer
welfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the
search engine market is a particularly powerful approach for E-Commerce."
"The issue of market-based versus mandated standards has been addressed in
many settings. In most settings in which network effects are present,
compatibility across platforms has been a key determinant of the success or
failure of a particular technology. In the case of wireless telecommunications,
however, interconnection and the availability of the relevant infrastructure
can be a substitute for compatibility.
  In this paper, we examine the tradeoff between mandated standards and
interconnection. We first provide institutional background; we then empirically
examine whether, other things being equal, penetration rates were lower (or
higher) for countries with multiple incompatible digital standards. We finally
discuss the implications of our results for the current debate about 3G
standards, in which CDMA2000, which is backed mainly by US firms, competes with
WCDMA, which is backed by the European Community."
"This paper examines the ideological and policy consensus that shaped
computing research funded by the Information Processing Techniques Office
(IPTO) within the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA). This historical case study of the period between Sputnik and the
creation of the ARPANET shows how military, scientific, and academic values
shaped the institutions and relations of a foundational period in the creation
of the Internet.
  The paper probes three areas: the ideology of the science policy consensus,
the institutional philosophy of IPTO under J. C. R. Licklider, and the ways
that this consensus and philosophy shaped IPTO research in the period leading
to the creation of the ARPANET. By examining the intellectual, cultural, and
institutional details of the consensus that governed IPTO research between 1957
and 1969, we can understand the ways that these values defined the range of
possibilities for network computing.
  The influence of the social values expressed by these actors was decisive:
that government had an obligation to support a broad base of scientific
research to promote both the public good and the national defense; that
IPTO-sponsored computing research would accomplish both military and scientific
objectives; and that IPTO could leverage its power within this consensus to
create a network to share resources and unite researchers over geographical
distance. A greater awareness of the ways that ""consensus"" worked in this
period -- the ""pre-history"" of the Internet -- provides a richer context for
evaluating the unique features of the Internet, such as its open architecture,
collegial culture, and standards-based governance."
"Do switching costs reduce or intensify price competition in markets where
firms charge the same price to old and new consumers? Theoretically, the answer
could be either ""yes"" or ""no,"" due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing
decisions. The firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers
who are ""locked-in"" and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher
future profitability. I demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon
theoretical model.
  800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer
this question. Before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change
service providers. This imposed significant switching costs on users, who
generally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. In May 1993 a new
database made 800-numbers portable. This drop in switching costs and
regulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers
provide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.
  I use contracts for virtual private network (VPN) services to test how AT&T
adjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability.
Preliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), I find that AT&T
reduced margins for VPN contracts containing toll-free services relative to
those that did not as the portability date approached. This implies that the
switching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive. These
results suggest that, despite toll-free services growing rapidly during this
time period, AT&T's incentive to charge a higher price to ""locked-in"" consumers
exceeded its incentive to capture new consumers in the high switching costs era
of non-portability."
"New computer-mediated channels of communication are action oriented and have
the ability to deliver information and dialogue - moderated and unmoderated -
which can facilitate the bringing together of a series of society's
stakeholders, opinion leaders and change agents, who have the ability to
influence social action. However, existing online studies have been limited in
explaining Internet users' willingness to participate in social change agendas
online. They have relied predominately on basic demographic descriptors such as
age, education, income and access to technology and have ignored, social,
psychological and attitudinal variables that may explain online participation
and social change. The authors propose a Q methodology research approach better
evaluate Internet users participation in online social change agendas."
"The Internet is changing rapidly the way people around the world communicate,
learn, and work. Yet the tremendous benefits of the Internet are not shared
equally by all. One way to close the gap of the ""digital divide"" is to ensure
Internet access to all schools from an early age. While both the USA and EU
have embraced the promotion of Internet access to schools, the two have decided
to finance it differently. This paper shows that the main costs of Internet
access to schools are not communications-related (telecommunications and
Internet services) but rather non-communications-related (hardware, educational
training, software). This paper goes on to discuss whether the identified costs
should be financed in any way by the universal service obligations funded by
the telecommunications industry/sector/consumers (sector specific) or a general
governmental budget (educational budget)."
"By combining persons around the world into a single market, the Internet may
serve as a substitute for urban agglomeration. That is, the Internet may level
the consumption playing field between large, variety-laden and small,
variety-starved markets. However, if local content on the Internet is more
prevalent in larger markets, then the Internet may be a complement for urban
agglomeration. Characterizing the nature of available content using Media
Metrix web page visits by about 13,500 households, we document that
substantially more online local content is available in larger markets.
Combining this with CPS Internet use data, we find statistically significant
direct evidence of both complementarity and substitutability: Individuals are
more likely to connect in markets with more local online content; and holding
local online content constant, are less likely to connect in larger markets. We
also find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: Blacks are more
likely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of
local population, making the Internet is a substitute for agglomeration of
preference minorities within cities, if not cities themselves. On balance we
find that the substitution and complementarity effects offset each other so
that the Internet does not promote or discourage agglomeration in larger
markets."
"After the 1991 economic policy made a shift from a closed economic model to a
market-oriented model. The government invited private sector to participate in
reforming its telecom sector. However, the government took a half-hearted
approach in overhauling the legal and regulatory regime, suitable for
competitive regime or in framing the 1994 Telecom Policy.
  Competition was allowed in cellular and basis services. The ministry and the
incumbent (DOT) issued licenses to their competitors. Lack of transparency in
issuing licenses and unrealistic license fee derailed the reforms process and
led to wasteful litigation. The courts did not support the regulator and
virtually made its role redundant."
"It has proved to be difficult to translate the lessons from the literature on
universal service into the policy framework because of political interests and
regulatory capture. Neither the USA or Europe has made a very good job of
devising a clean framework and the WTO agreement is sparing in this area. A
number of pressures in the European context have enabled a more systematic
approach to emerge, that exploits the academic work. They include the need for
the European regulatory framework to encompass E. European countries where
network development and income levels are much lower, the desire to encompass
Internet within the universal service regulatory framework, a willingness to
design a framework that covers all communications networks and remove the
telecommunications bias, thereby forcing issues of economic neutrality to the
fore. The paper systematically goes through a number of key areas and
principles of regulation and how they are being designed to deal with a range
of national situations. They include, defining the scope of universal service
and the principles by which it might be modified in the light of technological
and economic developments; incorporating latitude for intervention outside this
defined scope, defining incentive and designation methods to encourage the
efficient supply of elements of universal service obligations, interpreting
affordability in the context of price and income levels that diverge
considerably, requiring both allocative efficiency and competitive neutrality,
formulating alternative financing methods including general government
financing and value added tax type methods which can co-exist and provide
comparative policy yardsticks."
"This paper explores commonalities between the creation of the Rural
Electrification Administration and the similar dilemma of providing an
affordable infrastructure for high-speed Internet access in places where profit
incentives do not exist. In the case of the R.E.A., the necessity for an
aggressive federal initiative to wire rural America, where the market for
electricity had failed, is revisited as the missing incentives are identified
and explored. We then examine the incentive-poor similarities between rural
electrification and rural high-speed Internet access through how consumers
currently and prospectively gain access to broadband Internet service. The
regulatory environment created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the
Federal Communications Commission is considered. Although the FCC is required
(Section 254.b.3) to take regulatory measures to ensure comparable and
affordable access to the Internet for all Americans, the historical
similarities and comparative analysis of rural electrification and high-speed
Internet access suggests the goal of universal service is unlikely to be met in
the near future. Regulatory disincentives to build such networks are present,
driven in part by market realities and in part by competitive restrictions in
the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Finally, we pose the question of whether a
federal effort equivalent to the R.E.A. is needed to ensure that residents of
sparsely populated areas, like their predecessors in the 1930s, are not
comparatively disadvantaged in the first decades of the 21st century. The paper
concludes with a proposal to accelerate the deployment of broadband
infrastructure in rural America."
"In this paper, we assess the applicability of auctions based on the Vickrey
second price model for allocating wireless spectrum in developing countries. We
first provide an overview of auction models for allocating resources. We then
examine the experience of auctioning spectrum in different countries. Based on
this examination, we posit some axioms that seem to have to be satisfied when
allocating spectrum in most developing countries. In light of these axioms, we
provide a critical evaluation of using Vickrey second- price auctions to
allocate spectrum in developing countries. We suggest the use of a new auction
mechanism, the Vickrey ""share auction"" which will satisfy many of these axioms."
"There have been a small number of cost studies of Voice over IP (VoIP) in the
academic literature. Generally, they have been for abstract networks, have not
been focused on the public switched telephone network, or they have not
included the operating costs. This paper presents the operating cost portion of
our ongoing research project comparing circuit-switched and IP network costs
for an existing local exchange carrier.
  We have found that (1) The operating cost differential between IP and circuit
switching for this LEC will be small; and (2) A substantial majority of a
telco's operating cost lies in customer service and outside plant maintenance,
which will be incurred equally in both networks in a pure substitution
scenario. Thus, the operating cost difference lies in the actual cost
differences of the switching technologies. This appears to be less than 10%-15%
of the total operating cost of the network. Thus, even if the cost differences
for substitute services were large, the overall impact on the telco's financial
performance would be small. But IP has some hidden benefits on the operations
side. Most notably, data and voice services could be managed with the same
systems infrastructure, meaning that the incremental operations cost of rolling
out new services would likely be much lower, since it would all be IP."
"Much of the existing approach to the digital divide suffers from an important
limitation. It is based on a binary classification of Internet use by only
considering whether someone is or is not an Internet user. To remedy this
shortcoming, this project looks at the differences in people's level of skill
with respect to finding information online. Findings suggest that people search
for content in a myriad of ways and there is a large variance in how long
people take to find various types of information online. Data are collected to
see how user demographics, users' social support networks, people's experience
with the medium, and their autonomy of use influence their level of user
sophistication."
"This paper analyzes the law and economics of United States v. Microsoft, a
landmark case of antitrust intervention in network industries. [abridged]"
"Networks Unplugged: Towards A Model of Compatibility Regulation Between
Information Platforms This Article outlines a basic model for regulating
interoperability between rival information platforms. In so doing, it insists
that antitrust, intellectual property, and telecommunications regulation all
must follow the same set of principles to facilitate competition between rival
standards where possible, mandating or allowing cooperation only where
necessary to facilitate competition within a standard when network-level
competition is infeasible. To date, the antitrust regime best approximates the
type of model I have in mind, but sound competition policy requires that
telecommunications regulation and intellectual property law follow its basic
principles as well."
"Rules are necessary to provide or shape the incentives of individuals and
organizations. This is particularly true when free markets lead to undesirable
outcomes. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 attempted to create incentives to
foster competition. Ambiguity as well as the timing of the Act has led to
delays in the clarification of rules and the rapid obsolescence of the
document. The paper presents the strategies that common carriers adopted to try
to tilt regulation in their favor, slow the entry of competitors, maintain
their market leadership, and expand into other segments. Some of the strategies
analyzed include lobbying efforts, court challenges, and lack of cooperation
with new entrants."
"The debate on the Information Society shows large agreement on the assumption
that the promised benefits will fully display only if the diffusion of ICTs and
the Internet will involve all the actors of the socio-economic system.
Accordingly, special emphasis is put on the participation of small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), but also on public administrations (PAs) as promoters and
catalysts of private initiatives. As for SMEs, public intervention concerns
both the promotion of fully competitive e-markets and the solution of market
failures. However, effective and efficient intervention requires specific
information on SMEs' approach to e-commerce, often depending upon specific
sector and local condition and in most cases still lacking. In order to
identify the need and the scope for public intervention, the paper focuses on a
peculiar SMEs-intensive productive environment: the manufacturing industrial
district, which traditionally constitutes an examples of winning SMEs' network,
characterised by common industrial culture and intense input-output
interactions. The paper presents empirical evidence from the Italian districts
of Como (textile industry) and Lumezzane (metalwork industry). The research
results show that pro-active entrepreneurs are creatively exploring the
opportunities offered by the Internet to promote their businesses. However, it
is also clear that the transition to the Internet economy still involves a
reduced percentage of potential participants, and that institutional actions
are needed in order to foster a larger participation."
"Independent regulatory commissions such as the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) must produce policies that reflect technical expertise, legal
precedent, and stakeholder input. Given these situational imperatives, how does
the FCC implement independence in its decision-making? This research explicates
some of the underlying rules, resources, and relationships within the
environment in which the agency is embedded that influence agency work
practices to operationalize independence. Research such as this may be helpful
in the creation of new, or for assessment of existing, regulatory commissions,
but only if great attention is paid not only to institutional structure, but
also to the practice of staff in the agency."
"The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a private
non-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US government, acts as
the de facto regulator for DNS policy. ICANN decides what TLDs will be made
available to users, and which registrars will be permitted to offer those TLDs
for sale. In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of
ICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its
potential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those
who transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the
government as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this
is correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust
immunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain
competition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate
that their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's
preventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring
the UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized as
anticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be subject
to the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in fact violated
the antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust state actor, whether
the DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it can shelter under
precedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as seems likely) a private
ICANN and those who petition it are subject to antitrust law, everyone involved
in the process needs to review their conduct with an eye towards legal
liability. ICANN should act very differently with respect to both the UDRP and
the competitive roots if it is to avoid restraining trade."
"Drawing on an ongoing longitudinal research study, we discuss problems in the
development of five next generation community networking projects in central
New York. The projects were funded under a state program to diffuse broadband
technologies in economically depressed areas of the state. The networks are
technologically complex and entail high costs for subscribers. The political
economy of the development process has biased the subscriber base toward the
resource rich and away from the resource poor, and toward tried-and-tested uses
like Internet and intra-organizational connectivity and away from
community-oriented uses. These trends raise troubling questions about network
ontology and function, and about the relation between the network and its
physical host community. The need for appropriate social policy, and new
planning practices, is argued to effect desired change."
"The paper explains why open source software is an instance of a potentially
broader phenomenon. Specifically, I suggest that nonproprietary peer-production
of information and cultural materials will likely be a ubiquitous phenomenon in
a pervasively networked society. I describe a number of such enterprises, at
various stages of the information production value chain. These enterprises
suggest that incentives to engage in nonproprietary peer production are trivial
as long as enough contributors can be organized to contribute. This implies
that the limit on the reach of peer production efforts is the modularity,
granularity, and cost of integration of a good produced, not its total cost. I
also suggest reasons to think that peer-production can have systematic
advantages over both property-based markets and corporate managerial
hierarchies as a method of organizing information and cultural production in a
networked environment, because it is a better mechanism for clearing
information about human capital available to work on existing information
inputs to produce new outputs, and because it permits largers sets of agents to
use larger sets of resources where there are increasing returns to the scale of
both the set of agents and the set of resources available for work on projects.
As capital costs and communications costs decrease in importance as factors of
information production, the relative advantage of peer production in clearing
human capital becomes more salient."
"Information technology is redefining national security and the use of force
by state and nonstate actors. The use of force over the Internet warrants
analysis given recent terrorist attacks. At the same time that information
technology empowers states and their commercial enterprises, information
technology makes infrastructures supported by computer systems increasingly
accessible, interdependent, and more vulnerable to malicious attack. The
Computer Security Institute and the FBI jointly estimate that financial losses
attributed to malicious attack amounted to $378 million in 2000. International
Law clearly permits a state to respond in self-defense when attacked by another
state through the Internet, however, such attacks may not always rise to the
scope, duration, and intensity threshold of an armed attack that may justify a
use of force in self-defense.
  This paper presents a policy framework to analyze the rules of engagement for
Internet attacks. We describe the state of Internet security, incentives for
asymmetric warfare, and the development of international law for conflict
management and armed conflict. We focus on options for future rules of
engagement specific to Information Warfare.
  We conclude with four policy recommendations for Internet attack rules of
engagement: (1) the U.S. should pursue international definitions of ""force"" and
""armed attack"" in the Information Warfare context; (2) the U.S. should pursue
international cooperation for the joint investigation and prosecution of
Internet attacks; (3) the U.S. must balance offensive opportunities against
defensive vulnerabilities; and (4) the U.S. should prepare strategic plans now
rather than making policy decisions in real-time during an Internet attack."
"This exploratory and descriptive research compares the policy-making
processes and policy recommendations regarding universal service and universal
access developed by the U.S. National Information Infrastructure Advisory
Council (NIIAC) and the Canadian Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) in
conjunction with related federal government agencies. Created in 1993 and 1994,
respectively, the Councils were charged with ""bringing forward"" the concepts of
universal service and universal access to adjust to the effects of
deregulation, new and converged Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs), and neo-liberal economic competition and globalization that included
acknowledging the private sector as the primary creator of the Information
Highway.This qualitative study used as its methodology organizational, policy,
narrative, and discourse analyses to create a picture of what universal service
and universal access were and what they became in the hands of NIIAC, IHAC. The
U.S. had started with a more clearly defined universal service tradition than
Canada, and undertook a more complex policy-making process with more
experienced personnel. It was also clear that IHAC had in many ways followed
the U.S. model and arrived at many similar recommendations as NIIAC. Because of
the inevitability of technical, economic, and social change related to the
Information Highway, no definitive outcome to the Universal Service and
Universal Access ""story"" can be determined. Because the Canadian government did
not follow up on some of IHAC's most crucial recommendations, the Canadian
Information Highway ""story,"" in particular, has been left less complete than
that of the U.S."
"Low search costs in Internet markets can be used by consumers to find low
prices, but can also be used by retailers to monitor competitors' prices. This
price monitoring can lead to price matching, resulting in dampened price
competition and higher prices in some cases. This paper analyzes price data for
316 bestselling, computer, and random book titles gathered from 32 retailers
between August 1999 and January 2000. In contrast to previous studies we find
no evidence of leader-follow behavior for the vast majority of retailers we
study. Further, the few cases of leader-follow behavior we observe seem to be
associated with managerial convenience as opposed to anti-competitive behavior.
We offer a methodology that can be used by future academic researchers or
government regulators to check for anti-competitive price matching behavior in
future time periods or in additional product categories."
"This article addresses the U.S. Supreme Court's central purpose formulation
in Reporters Committee v. Department of Justice under the federal Freedom of
Information Act. By examining all lower federal court opinions interpreting
Reporters Committee and by analyzing the effects of the Court's opinion on the
implementation of the FOIA, the paper finds that the Court's opinion has
greatly narrowed the scope of the FOIA and limited the power of EFOIA to
democratize electronic information. To assist in remedying the damage to the
public interest in freedom of information, the author urges judicial
consideration of a Privacy Act case, Tobey v. NRB, that more subtly treats
information collected by government about individuals. The paper concludes that
the Privacy Act demonstrates clearly that information, particularly
computerized databases, can not be treated categorically for purposes of
access."
"Five years after the '96 Telecommunications Act, we still find precious
little local facilities-based competition. In response there are calls in
Congress and even from the FCC for new legislation to ""free the Bells.""
However, the same ideology drove policy, not just five years ago, but also
almost twenty years back with the first modern push for ""freedom,"" namely
divestiture.
  How might we frame the question of policy for local access to engender a more
fruitful approach? The starting point for this analysis is the network--not
bits and bytes, but the human network. With the human network as starting
point, the unit of analysis is the community--specifically, the individual in a
tension with community. There are two core ideas.
  The first takes a behavioral approach to the economics--and the relative
share between beneficial chaos and order, in economic affairs, becomes
explicit.
  If the first main idea provides a conceptual base for open source, the second
core idea distinguishes open source from open design, ie at the information
'frontier' we push forward.
  The resulting policy frame for access is worked out in the detailed, concrete
steps of an extended thought experiment. A small town setting (Concord,
Massachusetts) grounds the discussion in the real world. The purpose overall is
to stimulate new thinking which may break out of the conundrum where periodic
rounds to legislate 'freedom' produce the opposite, recursively. The ultimate
aim is better fit between our analytically-driven expectations and economic
outcomes."
"In this piece, we take up the case of the domain name system as an example of
challenges and solutions for realspace sovereigns in cyberspace. First, we
analyze the 'in rem' provision of the US Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection
Act (ACPA), which purports to expand the scope of the ACPA to encompass
disputes with little direct connection with the United States. In reality,
there exist no cases of foreign cybersquatting as to which the 'in rem'
provision will be both applicable and constitutional. Instead the ACPA 'in rem'
provision is notable primarily for its aggressive assertion of jurisdiction,
leading us to consider the (often overlooked) role of realspace sovereigns in
the regulation of the domain names system. By mapping the logical control over
the domain names system-the distributed hierarchy that is the basis of the
system's design-onto realspace territory, the potential for sovereign
regulation of the system becomes apparent. We argue that the regulatory
significance of geography, and the essentially arbitrary nature of the present
territorial locations of the key components of the domain name system implies
the future segmentation of the domain name system, and the resulting dramatic
decrease in its value. Accordingly, we argue that realspace sovereigns (and
especially the United States) have strong interests in avoiding segmentation,
and thus must seek to coordinate the regulation of the system."
"This paper brings evidence to bear on the question of the long-term effects
of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws
on findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall
2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that
early adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities
and to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters.
Further, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their
community involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four
sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in
political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce
those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic
minded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial
applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four
sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,
2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other
studies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,
among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument
that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily
to the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.
As later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement
or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet
access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic
engagement in geographic communities."
"In this paper, we aim to empirically examine the value of website usage and
sellers' listing behavior in the two leading Internet auctions sites, eBay and
Yahoo!Auctions. The descriptive data analysis of the seller's equilibrium
listing behavior indicates that a seller's higher expected auction revenue from
eBay is correlated with a lager number of potential bidders measured by website
usage per listing. Our estimation results, based on the logarithm
specifications of sellers' expected auction revenues and potential bidders'
website usage, show that in a median case, (i) 1 percent increase of the unique
visitors (page views) per listed item induces 0.022 (0.007) percent increase of
a seller's expected auction revenue; and (ii) 1 percent increase of sellers'
listings induces 1.99 (4.74) percent increase of the unique visitors (page
views). Since increased expected auction revenues will induce more listings, we
can infer positive feedback effects between the number of listings and website
usage. Consequently, Yahoo!Auctions, which has substantially less listings, has
greater incentives to increase listings via these feedback effects which are
reflected in its fee schedules."
"This research investigates the relationship between telecommunications
infrastructure, economic conditions, and federal and state policies and
initiatives. It presents a detailed look at the telecommunications environment
of the Appalachian region, particularly focusing on broadband technologies. A
strong, positive association exists between telecommunications infrastructure
and economic status. The effects of federal and state universal service
policies are examined, as well as some of the ways states have leveraged their
own infrastructure to improve telecommunications capabilities in their region.
Other state and local telecommunications-related programs are noted."
"Is a commercial mass media, dependent on the market for its sustenance,
necessary, or even desirable, for liberal democracy? Yochai Benkler has argued
that a decentralized, peer-to-peer system of communications and information is
both possible with digital technology and preferable to a system based on
commercial mass media. He has contended in fact that the presence of
politically powerful, copyright-rich mass media imposes significant barriers to
the development of peer-to-peer information-sharing networks. In contrast, I
have argued that the commercial mass media play an important, and perhaps even
vital, role in liberal democracy by galvanizing public opinion, serving as a
watchdog against government and corporate wrongdoing, agenda-setting (which
enables public discourse), and serving as a relatively trustworthy source of
information. This paper seeks to push the ball forward on this issue. It first
isolates and enumerates the contributions that the commercial mass media are
said to make towards liberal democracy. It then briefly assesses the extent to
which the commercial mass media actually fulfills these constitutive functions.
It then asks whether alternative institutions might serve some or all of these
functions just as well or better. In so doing, it looks both to the past and
the future. First, it examines the political party-supported press that thrived
in the United States through much of the 19th century. Second, it examines
government-funded mass media. Third, it looks, skeptically, at possibilities
for peer-to-peer sharing of information and opinion in the digital network
environment. I conclude that, despite the weaknesses of commercial mass media,
an information policy suitable to liberal democracy should include a plurality
of types of voices, including commercial mass media."
"In 1999, the FCC authorized direct access to INTELSAT, allowing INTELSAT's
U.S. customers and competitors to bypass INTELSAT's U.S. retail affiliate
(COMSAT), and to take satellite capacity at wholesale prices directly from
INTELSAT. This policy was modeled in many respects on the access and unbundling
requirements applicable to domestic incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. At the same time, incumbent domestic
cable TV system operators have not been required to provide wholesale open
access to competitive Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking to provide
residential broadband Internet service through existing proprietary cable
facilities. Yet the policy arguments favoring open access to incumbent domestic
cable systems appear to be stronger than those favoring direct access to
INTELSAT.
  For example, it may be fairly debated whether entrenched cable system
operators are now positioned to unfairly leverage their dominance in the
multichannel video programming distribution (MVPD) market to thwart competition
in the broadband ISP market, as some cable open access advocates assert. In
contrast, it is clear that no analogous issues of tying were implicated by
INTELSAT in 1999, when its position in the international telecommunications
market was substantially nondominant and, in any event, it had no new product
to tie to its established offerings. Similarly, while it may be debated whether
or not a cable plant is a bottleneck facility that gatekeeps broadband Internet
for many residential users, it is beyond cavil that INTELSAT in 1999 controlled
virtually no such bottleneck facilities."
"The current pattern of competition in the Brazilian telecommunications market
was defined by a regulatory reform implemented in the second half of the
nineties. The telecommunications regulatory reform discussed in the paper
promoted the privatization of Telebras System and fostered competition in the
Brazilian market under the stricted supervision of the new regulator Anatel.
Notwithstanding, the regulatory Brazilian scheme is at a crossroads. From 2002
on an open market approach will be implemented in telecom arena. We analyse the
main aspects of those change, from the firms perspective and also in a broad
scenario under influence of the World Trade Organization system"
"A major goal of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to promote competition
in both the local exchange and long distance wireline markets. In section 271
Congress permitted the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to enter the long
distance market only if they demonstrate to the FCC that they have complied
with the market-opening requirements of section 251. This paper examines the
logic behind section 271, to determine if it is a reasonable means of achieving
increased competition in both the local and long distance markets, given the
technical characteristics of the industry and the legal and informational
constraints on regulators who must ensure compliance. It also provides an
update on the extent of competitive entry in the local exchange market five
years after enactment of the Act.
  In this paper we examine a variety of schemes for ensuring BOC compliance
that Congress could have used. Given the characteristics of the industry and
the limitations on regulators' ability to observe BOC's efforts, we determine
that the use of a prize such as BOC entry into long distance is a superior
incentive mechanism. We further determine that conditioning a BOC's long
distance entry on its demonstrating compliance with section 251 is a logical
method of protecting the long distance market against a BOC discriminating
against long distance competitors once it has gained entry. The statistical
evidence we look at, using data we have collected on ILEC lines sold to CLECs
for POTS services, appears to confirm that section 271 has thus far been
effective in ensuring compliance."
"The early election call in the fall of 2000 provided the perfect opportunity
to study the impact the Internet has had on election campaigning in Canada.
With the explosion of use the Net has seen since the 1997 general election,
Canadian federal parties stood at the threshold of a new age in election
campaigning. Pundits such as Rheingold (1993) have argued that the Internet
will provide citizens with a way to bypass traditional media and gain
unmediated access to each parties political message as well as providing a
forum for citizens to engage the parties, and each other in deliberative
debate.
  Through a longitudinal analysis of party web pages and telephone interviews
with party staffers, we analyze the role the Internet played in the election
campaigns of Canada's federal parties. Our findings indicate that the parties
are still focusing on providing online features that talk at the voter instead
of engaging them in any type of meaningful discourse. Most of these sites were
exceptionally similar in their structure and in the type of content they
provided. Generally, these sites served as digital archives for campaign
material created with other media in mind and despite the multimedia
capabilities of the Internet, these sites tended to be overwhelmingly text
oriented. In line with Stromer-Galley's (2000) discussion of why candidates in
the U.S. avoid online interaction, we also argue that little incentive exists
to motivate parties to engage in any meaningful interaction with voters online."
"The paper examines the South African transition from apartheid to democracy
through the lens of the reform of the communication sector. Through a set of
participatory stakeholder consultative processes, the institutions of
broadcasting, telecommunications, print press, and state information agency
underwent reform in a process I refer to as 'negotiated liberalization.'"
"As privacy issues have gained social salience, entrepreneurs have begun to
offer privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) and the U.S. has begun to enact
privacy legislation.
  But ""privacy"" is an ambiguous notion. In the liberal tradition, it is an
individualistic value protecting citizens from intrusion into a realm of
autonomy. A feminist critique suggests that the social utility of privacy is to
exclude certain issues from the public realm. Sociologists suggest that privacy
is about identity management, while political economists suggest that the most
salient privacy issue is the use of personal information to normalize and
rationalize populations according to the needs of capital.
  While PETs have been developed for use by individual consumers, recently
developers are focusing on the business to business market, where demand is
stoked by the existence of new privacy regulations. These new laws tend to
operationalize privacy in terms of ""personally identifiable information."" The
new generation of PETs reflect and reify that definition. This, in turn, has
implications for the everyday understandings of privacy and the constitution of
identity and social life.
  In particular, this socio-technical practice may strengthen the ability of
data holders to rationalize populations and create self-serving social
categories. At the same time, they may permit individuals to negotiate these
categories outside of panoptic vision. They may also encourage public
discussion and awareness of these created social categories."
"This paper tells the story leading to ICANN's selection of seven new Internet
top level domains in November 2000. In implementing proposals to expand the
name space, ICANN adopted an approach far different from Jon Postel's
lightweight proposals. ICANN staff, in setting the ground rules for considering
new gTLDs, emphasized that only a few applicants would be allowed in, and
imposed strict threshold requirements. Staff determined that the Board should
pick TLDs by looking at all relevant aspects of every proposal, and deciding
which ones presented the best overall combination of a variety of
incommensurable factors. Aspects of the resulting process were predictable:
Anyone familiar with the FCC comparative hearing process for broadcast licenses
can attest that this sort of ad hoc comparison is necessarily subjective,
lending itself to arbitrariness and biased application. Yet the process had
advantages that appealed to ICANN decision-makers. The Board members would be
free to take their best shots, in a situationally sensitive manner, at
advancing the policies they thought important. The approach allowed ICANN to
maintain the greatest degree of control. The end result, though, was a process
stunning in its arbitrariness, a bad parody of fact-bound, situationally
sensitive (rather than rules-based) decision-making."
"When decisions about developing standards are left to individual firms, there
are many advantages including a flexible response to market evolution,
accommodation to rapid technology change, and avoidance of costly coordination.
However, the market process does not necessarily lead to compatible standards,
especially when there is no clear market dominator. Standards Institutions
generally facilitate better communication among market participants, which may
discourage early and/or primitive incompatible standards to emerge in the
market. However, expenditures on institutional standards-setting can lead to
diminishing returns, or even be counter-productive because institutional
standards usually take longer to produce and are slower to respond to
technology development. Government agencies can specify compulsory standards to
avoid incompatibility. In addition, governments can tie their policy on
standardization closely with their industrial, trade, and/or regulatory
policies. However, many exogenous factors handicap a government's effective
involvement. Government often fails to respond to the dynamics of technology
development and consumer demand, and to pick up the ""right technology"". This
study first discusses why two different models have emerged in the two regions.
It then examines outcomes and implications of the two models, including impacts
on domestic service deployment, global trade competition, technology
innovations, and strategies of multinational corporations. The goal is to
conduct an empirical comparison between the two contrasting models."
"For wireless communications, the FCC has fostered competition rather than
openness. This has permitted the emergence of vertically integrated end-to-end
providers, creating problems of reduced hardware innovation, software
applications, user choice, and content access. To deal with these emerging
issues and create multi-level forms of competition, one policy is likely to
suffice: a Carterfone for wireless, coupled with more unlicensed spectrum."
"This paper uses the software program Linux and the discourse around it in
order to examine how software programs can be used to articulate and defend
social and economic positions. Although I do not use the term ""expression"" in a
strict legal sense, I claim that in order to make policy decisions involving
software, it is important to understand how the functionality of software is
expressive. Another way to state this is that software programs like Linux are
socially meaningful through functionality and talk about functionality.
  In section I, I review some recent legal scholarship about software and
explain why understanding how embedded technical expression works is important
given the increasingly large role of software in governance. In section II, I
explore software construction as a combination of social and technical
practices. In section III, I describe some examples of meaning-making around
the software program Linux. In section IV I conclude with a short description
of why such analyses are important."
"By surveying the universal service policies in six Latin American countries,
this study explores the evolution of the concept during the rollout of the
telecommunication reform in the last decade. Country profiles and a set of
universal service indicators provide a frame for discussing issues of
accessibility and affordability of telephone service in the region. This study
found that the reconfiguration of national networks fostered by liberalization
policies offered risks and opportunities to achieve universal service goals.
The diversification of access points and services enhanced users choices but
price rebalancing and lack of Universal Service Obligations (USO) to target
groups with special needs depressed the demand and threatened to exclude
significant parts of the population. The situation requires the reformulation
of USO incorporating all technological solutions existing in the market, and
factors from the consumer-demand accounting for the urban-rural continuum, and
different social and economic strata. This study identifies the emergence of a
second generation of USO targeting some of these needs. However, more
competition and special tariff plans for the poor need to be incorporated to
the options available in the market."
"When the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) selected a
radio access technology based on Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access
(WCDMA), sponsored by European telecommunications equipment manufactures
Ericsson and Nokia, for its third-generation wireless communications system, a
bitter dispute developed between ETSI and Qualcommm Inc. Qualcomm threatened to
withhold its intellectual property on the CDMA technology unless the Europeans
agreed to make the radio access technology backward compatible with cdmaOne,
Qualcomm's favored version of CDMA. A dispute over intellectual property rights
over key CDMA techniques also erupted between Ericsson and Qualcomm and both
filed patent infringement in US Court. The dispute halted the standards
activity and has troubled operators worldwide as well as the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU)."
"Peer to peer networks will become an increasingly important distribution
channel for consumer information goods and may play a role in the distribution
of information within corporations. Our research analyzes optimal membership
rules for these networks in light of positive and negative externalities
additional users impose on the network. Using a dataset gathered from the six
largest OpenNap-based networks, we find that users impose a positive network
externality based on the desirability of the content they provide and a
negative network externality based on demands they place on the network.
Further we find that the marginal value of additional users is declining and
the marginal cost is increasing in the number of current users. This suggests
that multiple small networks may serve user communities more efficiently than
single monolithic networks and that network operators may wish to specialize in
their content and restrict membership based on capacity constraints and user
content desirability."
"Although patent law purports to cover all manner of technologies, we have
noticed recent divergence in the standards applied to biotechnology and to
software patents: the Federal Circuit has applied a very permissive standard of
obviousness in biotechnology, but a highly restrictive disclosure requirement.
The opposite holds true for software patents, which seems to us exactly
contrary to sound policy for either industry. These patent standards are
grounded in the legal fiction of the ""person having ordinary skill in the art""
or PHOSITA. We discuss the appropriateness of the PHOSITA standard, concluding
that it properly lends flexibility to the patent system. We then discuss the
difficulty of applying this standard in different industries, offering
suggestions as to how it might be modified to avoid the problems seen in
biotechnology and software patents."
"This paper examines the effects of licensing conditions, in particular of
spectrum fees, on the pricing and diffusion of mobile communications services.
Seemingly exorbitant sums paid for 3G licenses in the UK, Germany in 2000 and
similarly high fees paid by U.S. carriers in the re-auctioning of PCS licenses
early in 2001 raised concerns as to the impacts of the market entry regime on
the mobile communications market.
  The evidence from the GSM and PCS markets reviewed in this paper suggests
that market entry fees do indeed influence the subsequent development of the
market. We discuss three potential transmission channels by which license fees
can influence the price and quantity of service sold in a wireless market: an
increase in average cost, an increase in incremental costs, and impacts of sunk
costs on the emerging market structure.
  From this conceptual debate, an empirical model is developed and tested using
cross-sectional data for the residential mobile voice market. We utilize a
structural equation approach, modeling the supply and demand relationships
subject to the constraint that supply equals demand. The results confirm the
existence of a positive effect of license fees on the cost of supply. However,
we also find that higher market concentration has a positive effect on the
overall supply in the market, perhaps supporting a Schumpeterian view that a
certain degree of market concentration facilitates efficiency."
"Communication technologies contain embedded values that affect our society's
fundamental values, such as privacy, freedom of speech, and the protection of
intellectual property. Researchers have shown the design of technologies is not
autonomous but shaped by conflicting social groups. Consequently, communication
technologies contain different values when designed by different social groups.
Continuing in this vein, we show that the institutions where communication
technologies are designed and developed are an important source of the values
of communication technologies. We use the term code to collectively refer to
the hardware and software of communication technologies. Institutions differ in
their motivations, structure, and susceptibility to external influences. First,
we focus on the political, economic, social, and legal influences during the
development of code. The institutional reactions to these influences are
embodied in code. Second, we focus on the decision-making issues in the review
process for code. This process determines the code's content and affects the
dissemination of code through the decision whether to publicly release the
code. We found these factors vary by institution. As a result, institutions
differ in the values that they incorporate into code or communications
technologies."
"This paper explains why, despite a marked increase in available political
information on cable television and the Internet, citizens' levels of political
knowledge have, at best, remained stagnant (Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1996).
Since the availability of entertainment content has increased too, the effect
of new media on knowledge and vote likelihood should be determined by people's
relative preferences for entertainment and information. Access to new media
should increase knowledge and vote likelihood among people who prefer news. At
the same time, it is hypothesized to have a negative effect on knowledge and
turnout for people who prefer entertainment content. Hypotheses are tested by
building a measure of Relative Entertainment Preference (REP) from existing NES
and Pew survey data. Results support the predicted interaction effect of media
environment (cable and/or Internet access) and motivation (REP) on political
knowledge and turnout. In particular, people who prefer entertainment to news
and have access to cable television and the Internet are less knowledgeable and
less likely to vote than any other group of people."
"We propose a quality of service (QoS) monitoring program for broadband access
to measure the impact of proprietary network spaces. Our paper surveys other
QoS policy initiatives, including those in the airline, and wireless and
wireline telephone industries, to situate broadband in the context of other
markets undergoing regulatory devolution. We illustrate how network
architecture can create impediments to open communications, and how QoS
monitoring can detect such effects. We present data from a field test of
QoS-monitoring software now in development. We suggest QoS metrics to gauge
whether information ""walled gardens"" represent a real threat for dividing the
Internet into proprietary spaces.
  To demonstrate our proposal, we are placing our software on the computers of
a sample of broadband subscribers. The software periodically conducts a battery
of tests that assess the quality of connections from the subscriber's computer
to various content sites. Any systematic differences in connection quality
between affiliated and non-affiliated content sites would warrant research into
the behavioral implications of those differences.
  QoS monitoring is timely because the potential for the Internet to break into
a loose network of proprietary content domains appears stronger than ever.
Recent court rulings and policy statements suggest a growing trend towards
relaxed scrutiny of mergers and the easing or elimination of content ownership
rules. This policy environment could lead to a market with a small number of
large, vertically integrated network operators, each pushing its proprietary
content on subscribers."
"Commercial cellular telecommunications networks are routinely used as key
means of voice and data transport by both businesses and the Public. Despite
advances in encryption and other security measures, these commercial cellular
networks remain extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks and the loss of user
and data privacy and integrity. Such losses can result not only in mere
inconvenience, but in serious corporate and national security breaches. Because
of the potentially catastrophic nature of such security breaches, it behooves
cellular network operators, distributors, and users to explore these network
risk areas and mitigate them to the extent that current resources allow."
"This focused study on state-level policy and access patterns contributes to a
fuller understanding of how these invisible barriers work to structure access
and define rural communities. Combining both quantitative and qualitative data,
this study examines the role of geo-policy barriers in one of the largest and
most rural states in the nation.
  Expanded Area Service policies are state policies wherein phone customers can
expand their local calling area. Because useful Internet access requires a
flat-price connection, EAS policies can play a crucial role in connecting
citizens to one another. EAS policies (including Texas') tend to vary along
five dimensions (community of interest, customer scope, directionality, pricing
mechanism and policy scope). EAS policies that rely on regulated market
boundaries for definition can generate gross inequities in rural Internet
access. Interviews with Internet Service Providers in a case study of 25 rural
communities reveals that LATA and exchange boundaries, along with
geographically restricted infrastructure investments, curtail service provision
in remote areas. A statistical analysis of 1300 telephone exchanges, including
208 rural telephone exchanges in Texas reveals that the farther a community
lies from a metropolitan area the less likely they are to have reliable
Internet access"
"Intermediaries, like real estate agents, Consumer Reports, and Zagats, have
long helped buyers to identify their most suitable options. Now, the
combination of databases and the Internet enables them to serve consumers
dramatically more effectively. This article begins by offering a three-part
framework for understanding the evolving forms of selection assistance. It then
focuses on numerous potential obstacles that could prevent shoppers from
enjoying the full benefits of these developing technologies. While concluding
that adjustments to business strategies and the enforcement of existing laws
can effectively overcome most of these impediments, the article identifies
several areas where proactive government action may be desirable, such as to
prevent the emergence of anticompetitive entry barriers."
"The ability to make international roaming calls is of increasing importance
to customers in Europe. This contrasts with various complaints that retail
prices of roaming calls are rigid and excessive. The focus if the paper is on
wholesale roaming, which is the prime determinant of retail roaming prices. The
paper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have
impaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the
two leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new
entrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. The paper argues that a
number of developments are under way that are likely to modify this situation
in the future. With the introduction of SIM over-the-air programming, home
mobile operators will be able to direct customers to networks with the lowest
charges. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800
operators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear.
Given the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently
provide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for
preferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it
will be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a
pan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for
preferred roaming status. This could discriminate against mobile operators in
downstream retail markets that do not have a pan-European footprint and that
lack the bargaining power. However, arbitrage by roaming brokers, new entry and
wider geographical markets on the retail roaming level will work against this."
"This paper focuses on a tension we discovered in the philosophical part of
our multidisciplinary project on values in web-browser security. Our project
draws on the methods and perspectives of empirical social science, computer
science, and philosophy to identify values embodied in existing web-browser
security and also to prescribe changes to existing systems (in particular,
Mozilla) so that values relevant to web-browser systems are better served than
presently they are. The tension, which we had not seen explicitly addressed in
any other work on computer security, emerged when we set out to extract from
the concept of security the set values that ought to guide the shape of
web-browser security. We found it impossible to construct an internally
consistent set of values until we realized that two robust -- and in places
competing -- conceptions of computer security were influencing our thinking. We
needed to pry these apart and make a primary commitment to one. One conception
of computer security invokes the ordinary meaning of security. According to it,
computer security should protect people -- computer users -- against dangers,
harms, and threats. Clearly this ordinary conception of security is already
informing much of the work and rhetoric surrounding computer security. But
another, substantively richer conception, also defines the aims and trajectory
of computer security -- computer security as an element of national security.
Although, like the ordinary conception, this one is also concerned with
protection against threats, its primary subject is the state, not the
individual. The two conceptions suggest divergent system-specifications, not
for all mechanisms but a significant few."
"This paper attempts to assess the international approach to Internet policy
in the context of distinctive socio-political frameworks evolving in the US,
the European Union (EU), and East Asia. The comparative review will develop a
set of underlying structural models of the Information Society particular to
each region, along with an analysis of their defining characteristics in
relation to one another. This examination demonstrates how each region, given
its regulatory legacy, has elected a different mix of good and bad
socio-political choices in public policy for the Internet. Despite the range
and diversity of paths to e-regulation suggested in these choices, none
adequately addresses the underlying issue of how to promote an innovative
society that is open to broad social participation. The paper evaluates
principal weaknesses in these regional models of Internet policy and argues the
need for re-conceptualizing the cultural, political and economic approach to
the new information space of the Internet."
"This paper uses clickstream data from Plurimus Corp. (formerly Foveon Corp.)
to analyze user choice of Internet portals. It will show that commonly used
econometric models for examining grocery scanner data can be applied to
clickstream data on advertising-based online markets. Developing a framework to
study consumer choices of free websites is an essential step to better
understanding user behavior on the Internet. The main data for this study is a
clickstream data set consisting of every website visited by 2654 users from
December 27 1999 to March 31 2000. Using this data, I construct several
variables including search success, time spent searching, and whether a website
is an individual's starting page. I also have advertising and media mentions
data. This study helps to increase understanding of user behavior on the
Internet. It explores some key determinants of website choice and simulates
market responses to changes in the online environment. By better understanding
website choice, we can better evaluate the implications of policy decisions."
"Recently, the FCC announced a new standard for review in mergers. Under the
new standard, mass media mergers that comply with existing rules will
automaticly receive approval, while those that do not will receive a more
searching review. Common carrier mergers, however, will continue to receive the
4=part test established in Bell Atlantic/Nynex. The new standard fails to take
into account the complexities of the emerging, converged networked world, and
is essentially obsolete on arrival. Looking to those areas where Congress has
required an additional public interest review of mergers, a pattern emerges.
The emergence of vast, vertically integrated networks of content and conduit
fit the historic pattern of areas requiring piublic interest review and
re-enforce the need for increased, rather than decreased merger review."
"There is much discussion and debate about how to improve the security and
privacy of mobile communication systems, both voice and data. Most proposals
attempt to provide incremental improvements to systems that are deployed today.
Indeed, only incremental improvements are possible, given the regulatory,
technological, economic, and historical structure of the telecommunications
system. In this paper, we conduct a ``thought experiment'' to redesign the
mobile communications system to provide a high level of security and privacy
for the users of the system. We discuss the important requirements and how a
different architecture might successfully satisfy them. In doing so, we hope to
illuminate the possibilities for secure and private systems, as well as explore
their real limits."
"The purpose of this paper is to examine the major factors surrouding and
contributing to the creation (and success) of Europe's 2nd generation 'GSM'
cellular system, and compare and contrast it to key events and recent
developments in 3rd generation 'IMT-2000' systems. The objective is to
ascertain whether lessons from the development of one system can be applied to
the other, and what implications 2G has for the development and assessment of
3G technologies. Among the major themes incorporated into this assessment is
the concept of cooperation, and its role in bringing about the collaboration
and integration necessary to support the success of an international cellular
standard."
"The paper contains a computer simulation concerning a basic non-Walrasian
equilibrium system, following the Edmond Malinvaud ""short side"" approach, as

"Vibrant development of a network-based economy requires separating investment
in highly location specific local access technology from the development of
standardized, geography-independent, wide-area network services. Thus far
interconnection arrangements and associated regulations have been too closely
tied to the idiosyncratic geographic structure of individual operators'
networks. A key industry challenge is to foster the development of a wide area
lattice of common geographic points of interconnection. Sound regulatory and
anti-trust policy can help address this industry need."
"An acceleration in the growth of communications bandwidth in use and a rapid
reduction in bandwidth prices have not accompanied the U.S. economy's strong
performance in the second half of the 1990s. Overall U.S. bandwidth in use has
grown robustly throughout the 1990s, but growth has not significantly
accelerated in the second half of 1990s. Average prices for U.S. bandwidth in
use have fallen little in nominal terms in the second half of the 1990s. Policy
makers and policy analysts should recognize that institutional change, rather
than more competitors of established types, appears to be key to dramatic
improvements in bandwidth growth and prices. Such a development could provide a
significant additional impetus to aggregate growth and productivity."
"To contribute to understanding of information economies of daily life, this
paper explores over the past millennium given names of a large number of
persons. Analysts have long both condemned and praised mass media as a source
of common culture, national unity, or shared symbolic experiences. Names,
however, indicate a large decline in shared symbolic experience over the past
two centuries, a decline that the growth of mass media does not appear to have
affected significantly. Study of names also shows that action and personal
relationships, along with time horizon, are central aspects of effective
communication across a large population. The observed preference for
personalization over the past two centuries and the importance of action and
personal relationships to effective communication are aspects of information
economies that are likely to have continuing significance for industry
developments, economic statistics, and public policy."
"Radio technology seems destined to become part of the standard
micro-processor input/output system. But unlike for memory or display systems,
for radio systems government regulation matters a lot. Much discussion of radio
regulation has focused on narrow spectrum management and interference issues.
Reflecting on historical experience and centuries of conversation about
fundamental political choices, persons working with radio technology should
also ponder three questions. First, what is a good separation and balance of
powers in radio regulation? Second, how should radio regulation be
geographically configured? Third, how should radio regulation understand and
respect personal freedom and equality? Working out answering to these questions
involves a general process of shaping good government. This process will be
hugely important for radio regulation, technology, and applications."
"This is a review of the article ""Government Preferences for Promoting
Open-Source Software: A Solution in Search of A Problem"" by David Evans and
Bernard J. Reddy. This report was paid for by Microsoft and put together at its
request. Now Microsoft is using it as part of their lobbying campaign in Europe
against governments' promotion of Open Source Software. As expected, this
article is strongly biased and most of the conclusions are based upon false
hypotheses and evidence."
"The past century ended with an unexpected explosion of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT), both in planning/managing public policies,
and in exchanging knowledge. However, the extent to which ICT-based tools
increase the level of public knowledge, or help decision makers is still
uncertain. Although indirectly, the overload of unfiltered Web-based
information seems able to hamper the knowledge growth of people, particularly
in some developing communities, whereas Decision Support Systems (DSS) and
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) prove to be ineffective if managed by
unskilled planning bodies. Given such warns, this paper outlines how the
different social and cultural awareness of local communities can affect the
outcomes of ICT-based tools. It further explores the impacts of ICT-based tools
on community development and spatial planning, emphasizing the role of proper
literacy and education for effective management."
"In this paper we present an innovative intelligent web-based computer-aided
instruction system for foreign language learning: CSIEC (Computer Simulator in
Educational Communication). This system can not only grammatically understand
the sentences in English given from the users via Internet, but also reasonably
and individually speak with the users. At first the related works in this
research field are analyzed. Then we introduce the system goals and the system
framework, i.e., the natural language understanding mechanism (NLML, NLOMJ and
NLDB) and the communicational response (CR). Finally we give the syntactic and
semantic content of this instruction system, i.e. some important notations of
English grammar used in it and their relations with the NLOMJ."
"The objective of this policy paper is to formulate a new policy in the field
of scientific and technical information (STI) in Kyrgyz Republic in the light
of emergence and rapid development of electronic scientific communication. The
major problem with communication in science in the Republic is lack of adequate
access to information by scientists. An equally serious problem is poor
visibility of research conducted in Kyrgyzstan and, as consequence, negligible
research impact on academic society globally. The paper proposes an integrated
approach to formulation of a new STI policy based on a number of policy
components: telecommunication networks, computerization, STI systems,
legislation & standards, and education & trainings. Two alternatives were
considered: electronic vs. paper-based scientific communication and development
of the national STI system vs. cross-national virtual collaboration. The study
results in suggesting a number of policy recommendations for identified
stakeholders."
"The proposed election system lies in ensuring that it is transparent and
impartial.Thus while the electoral system may vary from country to country, It
has to take into account the peculiarities of every society while at the same
time incorporating remedies to problems prevailing in the system.
  The Electoral process expressed serious concerns regarding the independence
of the Election Commission of Pakistan, the restrictions on political parties
and their candidates, the misuse of state resources, some unbalanced coverage
in the state media, deficiencies in the compilation of the voting register and
significant problems relating to the provision of ID cards.
  The holding of a general election does not in itself guarantee the
restoration of democracy. The unjustified interference with electoral
arrangements, as detailed above, irrespective of the alleged motivation,
resulted in serious flaws being inflicted on the electoral process.
Additionally, questions remain as to whether or not there will be a full
transfer of power from a military to civilian administration.

"The explosion of people networking in cyberspace, disseminating terabytes of
information, is being promoted through the use of broadband, bluetooth
technology, and wireless mobile computing facilities. New communities within
such venues as virtual chat rooms discussion groups, newsgroups etc are being
created daily and even hourly. This is raising issues of cyberethics concerning
privacy,security, crime, human needs, e-business, e-healthcare, e-government
and intellectual property among others that need to be evaluated and reflected
upon. With this new freedom come new moral and ethical responsibilities, which
raise questions as to whether anything can be published or whether there should
be restrictions. This paper addresses one specific area, that has come into the
public eye, the closure by Microsoft of all of its free chat rooms."
"Information Technology is emerging to be the technology of 21st century. The
paradigm shift from industrial society to information society had already
become a reality! It is indeed high time to think about integrating IT in all
facets of education -- may it be in secondary level, or be it in reskilling the
employed ones. This paper discusses various issues in incorporating IT in
various levels of education, and the need to think about a task force to
counter the so-called slow down and recession in IT industry. The opportunities
for aspiring IT professionals were also discussed. The importance of reskilling
as a continuing education programme to make the people aware of the changing
trends in IT was also discussed."
"The following notes contain a computer simulation concerning effective
competition in an evolutionary environment. The scope is to underline the
existence of a side effect pertaining to the competitive processes: the
tendency toward an excess of supply by producers which operate in a strongly
competitive situation. A set of four oligopolistic firms will be employed in
the formal reconstruction. The simulation will operate following the Edmond
Malinvaud ""short side"" approach, as far as the price adjustment is concerned,
and the sequential Hicksian ""weeks"" structure with regard of the temporal

"Text-to-speech technology has been broadly used to help people with voice
disabilities to overcome their difficulties. With text-to-speech, a person
types at a keyboard, the text is synthesized, and the sound comes out through
the computer speakers.
  In recent years, Voice over IP (VoIP) applications have become very popular
and have been used by people worldwide. These applications allow people to talk
for free over the Internet and also to make traditional calls through the
Public-Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) at a small fraction of the cost
offered by traditional phone companies.
  We have created a system, called EasyVoice, which integrates speech
synthesizers with VoIP applications. The result allows a person with motor
impairments and voice disabilities to talk with another person located anywhere
in the world. The benefits in this case are much stronger than the ones
obtained by non-disabled people using VoIP applications. People with motor
impairments sometimes can hardly use a regular or mobile phone. Thus, the
advantage is not only the reduction in cost, but more important, the ability to
talk at all."
"The paper tries to identify new emerging patterns in the context of
technological progress. Just as industrialization is associated with
rationalization, mechanization, and automation, the Internet age is associated
with computer models, embedded knowledge, and collaboration. Comparison among
patterns is highlighted and analysis is done from predictability-based
perspective."
"The present note includes explanatory comments about the synergic interaction
within the sphere of the socioeconomic analysis between the two following
theoretical frameworks. (I). The Darwinian evolutionary model. (II). The
computer simulation in accordance with the principia established by Bruno de
Finetti and Herbert Simon."
"Availing services provided via the Internet became a widely accepted means in
organising one's life. Beside others, eLearning goes with this trend as well.
But, while employing Internet service makes life more convenient, at the same
time, it raises risks with respect to the protection of the users' privacy.
This paper analyses the attitudes of eLearning users towards their privacy by,
initially, pointing out terminology and legal issues connected with privacy.
Further, the concept and implementation as well as a result analysis of a
conducted study is presented, which explores the problem area from different
perspectives. The paper will show that eLearning users indeed care for the
protection of their personal information when using eLearning services.
However, their attitudes and behaviour slightly differ. In conclusion, we
provide first approaches of assisting possibilities for users how to resolve
the difference of requirements and their actual activities with respect to
privacy protection."
"Bayesian neural networks were used to model the relationship between input
parameters, Democracy, Allies, Contingency, Distance, Capability, Dependency
and Major Power, and the output parameter which is either peace or conflict.
The automatic relevance determination was used to rank the importance of input
variables. Control theory approach was used to identify input variables that
would give a peaceful outcome. It was found that using all four controllable
variables Democracy, Allies, Capability and Dependency; or using only
Dependency or only Capabilities avoids all the predicted conflicts."
"Realizing test scenarios through a tutoring system involve questions about
architecture and didactic methods in such a system. Observing the fact that
traditional tutoring systems normally are domain-static, this paper shows
investigations for a generic domain-independent tutoring system for utilizing
test scenarios in computer-based and web-based environments. Furthermore, test
paradigms are analyzed and it is presented an approach for realizing
functionality for applying test paradigms in the presented generic tutoring
system architecture by an XML-specified language."
"According to socio-constructivism approach, collective situations are
promoted to favor learning in classroom, at a distance or in a blended
educational context. So, many Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
are provided to teachers but there are no clear studies about the way they are
used and perceived. Our research is based on the hypothesis that practices of
educational actors (instructional designers and tutors) are far away from
theoretical results of research in education technologies. In this paper, we
consider a precise kind of situation: Instrumented Collective Learning
Situations (ICLS). By a survey on 13 fields in higher education in France,
Switzerland and Canada, we present how ICLS are designed and how teachers used
them. Conclusions give an indication on the gap between the way information
technologies are prescribed and the way they are actually used and perceived by
teachers."
"Currently, educational platforms propose many tools of communication,
production, labour division or collective work management in order to support
collective activities. But it is not guaranteed that actors (instructional
designers, tutors or learner) are really using them. Our work, describe
characteristics of instrumented learning situations (ICLS) in the higher
education. Our intention is to determine: if ICLS are really existing; which
form they take (in terms of scenario, tools, type of activity...) ; if
recommendations resulting from research tasks are taken into account by
instructional designers and if the instructional designer prescribed activities
are really follow by learners or tutors? To answer these questions, we have
made a survey about ICLS actors uses."
"Since January 1, 2005 we have launched ""OPTO"" Portal, a website dedicated to
optical communities in Indonesia. The address of this portal is
http://www.opto.lipi.go.id and is self-supporting managed and not for
commercial purposes. Our aims in launching this portal are to benefit Internet
facility in increasing the communities' scientific activity; to provide an
online reference in Indonesian language for optics-based science and technology
subjects; as well as to pioneer the communities' online activities with real
impacts and benefits for our society. We will describe in the paper the
features of this portal that can be utilized by all individuals or members of
optical communities to store and share information and to build networks or
partnership as well. We realized that this portal is still not popular and most
of our aims are still not reached. This conference should be a good place for
all of us to collaborate to properly utilize this portal for the advantages to
the optical communities in Indonesia and our society at large."
"This paper is to obtain a simple dividing-diagram of the congressional
districts, where the only limit is that each district should contain the same
population if possibly. In order to solve this problem, we introduce three
different standards of the ""simple"" shape. The first standard is that the final
shape of the congressional districts should be of a simplest figure and we
apply a modified ""shortest split line algorithm"" where the factor of the same
population is considered only. The second standard is that the gerrymandering
should ensure the integrity of the current administrative area as the
convenience for management. Thus we combine the factor of the administrative
area with the first standard, and generate an improved model resulting in the
new diagram in which the perimeters of the districts are along the boundaries
of some current counties. Moreover, the gerrymandering should consider the
geographic features.The third standard is introduced to describe this
situation. Finally, it can be proved that the difference between the supporting
ratio of a certain party in each district and the average supporting ratio of
that particular party in the whole state obeys the Chi-square distribution
approximately. Consequently, we can obtain an archetypal formula to check
whether the gerrymandering we propose is fair."
"The social news aggregator Digg allows users to submit and moderate stories
by voting on (digging) them. As is true of most social sites, user
participation on Digg is non-uniformly distributed, with few users contributing
a disproportionate fraction of content. We studied user participation on Digg,
to see whether it is motivated by competition, fueled by user ranking, or
social factors, such as community acceptance.
  For our study we collected activity data of the top users weekly over the
course of a year. We computed the number of stories users submitted, dugg or
commented on weekly. We report a spike in user activity in September 2006,
followed by a gradual decline, which seems unaffected by the elimination of
user ranking. The spike can be explained by a controversy that broke out at the
beginning of September 2006. We believe that the lasting acrimony that this
incident has created led to a decline of top user participation on Digg."
"There is overwhelming evidence that the continued and widespread use of
untested spreadsheets in business gives rise to regular, significant and
unexpected financial losses. Whilst this is worrying, it is perhaps a
relatively minor concern compared with the risks arising from the use of poorly
constructed and/or untested spreadsheets in medicine, a practice that is
already occurring. This article is intended as a warning that the use of poorly
constructed and/or untested spreadsheets in clinical medicine cannot be
tolerated. It supports this warning by reporting on potentially serious
weaknesses found while testing a limited number of publicly available clinical
spreadsheets."
"In recent years, the study of complex networks has received a lot of
attention. Real systems have gained importance in scientific publications,
despite of an important drawback: the difficulty of retrieving and manage such
great quantity of information. This paper wants to be an introduction to the
construction of spiders and scrapers: specifically, how to program and deploy
safely these kind of software applications. The aim is to show how software can
be prepared to automatically surf the net and retrieve information for the user
with high efficiency and safety."
"This short paper is intended as an additional progress report to share our
experiences in Indonesia on collecting, integrating and disseminating both
global and local scientific data across the country through the web technology.
Our recent efforts are exerted on improving the local public access to global
scientific data, and on the other hand encouraging the local scientific data to
be more accessible for the global communities. We have maintained
well-connected infrastructure and some web-based information management systems
to realize such objectives. This paper is especially focused on introducing the
ARSIP for mirroring global as well as sharing local scientific data, and the
newly developed Indonesian Scientific Index for integrating local scientific
data through an automated intelligent indexing system."
"Her Majestys Revenue & Customs (HMRC) was born out of the need to create a UK
tax authority by merging both the Inland Revenue and HM Customs & Excise into
one department. HMRC encounters spreadsheets in tax-payers systems on a very
regular basis as well as being a heavy user of spreadsheets internally. The
approach to spreadsheet risk assessment and spreadsheet audit is by the use of
trained computer auditors and data handlers. This, by definition, limits the
use of our specialist spreadsheet audit tool to such trained staff. In order to
tackle the growing use of spreadsheets, a new way of approaching the problem
has been piloted. The aim is to issue all staff who come across spreadsheets
with a simple to use analysis and risk assessment tool, based on the
departmental software SpACE (Spreadsheet Audit & Compliance Examination)."
"Most organizations today use spreadsheets in some form or another to support
critical business processes. However the financial resources, and developmental
rigor dedicated to them are often minor in comparison to other enterprise
technology. The increasing focus on achieving regulatory and other forms of
compliance over key technology assets has made it clear that organizations must
regard spreadsheets as an enterprise resource and account for them when
developing an overall compliance strategy. This paper provides the reader with
a set of practical strategies for addressing spreadsheet compliance from an
organizational perspective. It then presents capabilities offered in the 2007
Microsoft Office System which can be used to help customers address compliance
challenges."
"All users of spreadsheets struggle with the problem of errors. Errors are
thought to be prevalent in spreadsheets, and in some instances they have cost
organizations millions of dollars. In a previous study of 50 operational
spreadsheets we found errors in 0.8% to 1.8% of all formula cells, depending on
how errors are defined. In the current study we estimate the quantitative
impacts of errors in 25 operational spreadsheets from five different
organizations. We find that many errors have no quantitative impact on the
spreadsheet. Those that have an impact often affect unimportant portions of the
spreadsheet. The remaining errors do sometimes have substantial impacts on key
aspects of the spreadsheet. This paper provides the first fully-documented
evidence on the quantitative impact of errors in operational spreadsheets."
"Recent research has highlighted the high incidence of errors in spreadsheet
models used in industry. In an attempt to reduce the incidence of such errors,
a teaching approach has been devised which aids students to reduce their
likelihood of making common errors during development. The approach comprises
of spreadsheet checking methods based on the commonly accepted educational
paradigms of peer assessment and self-assessment. However, these paradigms are
here based upon practical techniques commonly used by the internal audit
function such as peer audit and control and risk self-assessment. The result of
this symbiosis between educational assessment and professional audit is a
method that educates students in a set of structured, transferable skills for
spreadsheet error-checking which are useful for increasing error-awareness in
the classroom and for reducing business risk in the workplace."
"This paper presents the results of an empirical evaluation of the quality of
a structured methodology for the development of spreadsheet models, proposed in
numerous previous papers by Rajalingham K, Knight B and Chadwick D et al. This
paper also describes an improved version of their methodology, supported by
appropriate examples. The principal objective of a structured and disciplined
methodology for the construction of spreadsheet models is to reduce the
occurrence of user-generated errors in the models. The evaluation of the
effectiveness of the methodology has been carried out based on a number of
real-life experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrate the
methodology's potential for improved integrity control and enhanced
comprehensibility of spreadsheet models."
"This paper presents the arguments and supporting business metrics for
Enterprise Spreadsheet Management to be seen as a necessary good. These
arguments are divided into a summary of external business drivers that make it
necessary and the good that may be delivered to business spreadsheet users
involved in repetitive manual processes."
"This management paper looks at the real world issues faced by practitioners
managing spreadsheets through the production phase of their life cycle. It
draws on the commercial experience of several developers working with large
corporations, either as employees or consultants or contractors. It provides
commercial examples of some of the practicalities involved with spreadsheet use
around the enterprise."
"We analyze the role that popularity and novelty play in attracting the
attention of users to dynamic websites. We do so by determining the performance
of three different strategies that can be utilized to maximize attention. The
first one prioritizes novelty while the second emphasizes popularity. A third
strategy looks myopically into the future and prioritizes stories that are
expected to generate the most clicks within the next few minutes. We show that
the first two strategies should be selected on the basis of the rate of novelty
decay, while the third strategy performs sub-optimally in most cases. We also
demonstrate that the relative performance of the first two strategies as a
function of the rate of novelty decay changes abruptly around a critical value,
resembling a phase transition in the physical world. 1"
"Web 2.0 works with the principle of weak cooperation, where a huge amount of
individual contributions build solid and structured sources of data. In this
paper, we detail the main properties of this weak cooperation by illustrating
them on the photo publication website Flickr, showing the variety of uses
producing a rich content and the various procedures devised by Flickr users
themselves to select quality. We underlined the interaction between small and
heavy users as a specific form of collective production in large social
networks communities. We also give the main statistics on the (5M-users,
150M-photos) data basis we worked on for this study, collected from Flickr
website using the public API."
"The dynamics of transportation through towns and cities is strongly affected
by the topology of the connections and routes. The current work describes an
approach combining complex networks and self-avoiding random walk dynamics in
order to quantify in objective and accurate manner, along a range of spatial
scales, the accessibility of places in towns and cities. The transition
probabilities are estimated for several lengths of the walks and used to
calculate the outward accessibility of each node. The potential of the
methodology is illustrated with respect to the characterization and
improvements of the accessibility of the town of Sao Carlos."
"In this paper, we report some on-going focused research, but are further keen
to set it in the context of a proposed bigger picture, as follows. There is a
certain depressing pattern about the attitude of industry to spreadsheet error
research and a certain pattern about conferences highlighting these issues. Is
it not high time to move on from measuring spreadsheet errors to developing an
armoury of disciplines and controls? In short, we propose the need to
rigorously lay the foundations of a spreadsheet engineering discipline.
Clearly, multiple research teams would be required to tackle such a big task.
This suggests the need for both national and international collaborative
research, since any given group can only address a small segment of the whole.
There are already a small number of examples of such on-going international
collaborative research. Having established the need for a directed research
effort, the rest of the paper then attempts to act as an exemplar in
demonstrating and applying this focus. With regard to one such of research, in
a recent paper, Panko (2005) stated that: ""...group development and testing
appear to be promising areas to pursue"". Of particular interest to us are some
gaps in the published research record on techniques to reduce errors. We
further report on the topics: techniques for cross-checking, time constraints
effects, and some aspects of developer perception."
"The article collects arguments for the necessity of a global academic
internet platform, which is organized as a kind of ``global scientific
parliament''. With such a constitution educational and research institutions
will have direct means for communicating scientific results, as well as a
platform for representing academia and scientific life in the public."
"The book argues ICT are part of the set of goods and services that determine
quality of life, social inequality and the chances for economic development.
Therefore understanding the digital divide demands a broader discussion of the
place of ICT within each society and in the international system. The author
argues against the perspectives that either isolates ICT from other basic
social goods (in particular education and employment) as well as those that
argue that new technologies are luxury of a consumer society. Though the author
accepts that new technologies are not a panacea for the problems of inequality,
access to them become a condition of full integration of social life. Using
examples mainly from Latin America, the work presents some general policy
proposals on the fight against the digital divide which take in consideration
other dimensions of social inequality and access to public goods.

"The excessive rate of patients arriving at accident and emergency centres is
a major problem facing South African hospitals. Patients are prioritized for
medical care through a triage process. Manual systems allow for inconsistency
and error. This paper proposes a novel system to automate accident and
emergency centre triage and uses this triage score along with an artificial
intelligence estimate of patient-doctor time to optimize the queue order. A
fuzzy inference system is employed to triage patients and a similar system
estimates the time but adapts continuously through fuzzy Q-learning. The
optimal queue order is found using a novel procedure based on genetic
algorithms. These components are integrated in a simple graphical user
interface. Live tests could not be performed but simulations reveal that the
average waiting time can be reduced by 48 minutes and priority is given to
urgent patients"
"In this paper we argue that Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), also
known as Large Games are an interesting research tool for policy
experimentation. One of the major problems with lawmaking is that testing the
laws is a difficult enterprise. Here we show that the concept of an MMOG can be
used to experiment with environmental laws on a large scale, provided that the
MMOG is a real game, i.e., it is fun, addictive, presents challenges that last,
etc.. We present a detailed game concept as an initial step."
"All major on-line social networks, such as MySpace, Facebook, LiveJournal,
and Orkut, are built around the concept of friendship. It is not uncommon for a
social network participant to have over 100 friends. A natural question arises:
are they all real friends of hers, or does she mean something different when
she calls them ""friends?"" Speaking in other words, what is the relationship
between off-line (real, traditional) friendship and its on-line (virtual)
namesake? In this paper, we use sociological data to suggest that there is a
significant difference between the concepts of virtual and real friendships. We
further investigate the structure of on-line friendship and observe that it
follows the Pareto (or double Pareto) distribution and is subject to age
stratification but not to gender segregation. We introduce the concept of
digital personality that quantifies the willingness of a social network
participant to engage in virtual friendships."
"The study examined the relationship between Java programming self-efficacy
and programming background of engineering students in a Nigerian University.
One hundred and ninety two final year engineering students randomly selected
from six engineering departments of the university participated in the study.
Two research instruments: Programming Background Questionnaire and Java
Programming Self-Efficacy Scale were used in collecting relevant information
from the subjects. The resulting data were analyzed using Pearson product
correlation and Multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed that Java
Programming self-efficacy has no significant relationship with each of the
computing and programming background factors. It was additionally obtained that
the number of programming courses offered and programming courses weighed
scores were the only predictors of Java self-efficacy."
"The development of electronic commerce is characterized with anonymity,
uncertainty, lack of control and potential opportunism. Therefore, the success
of electronic commerce significantly depends on providing security and privacy
for its consumers sensitive personal data. Consumers lack of acceptance in
electronic commerce adoption today is not merely due to the concern on security
and privacy of their personal data, but also lack of trust and reliability of
Web vendors. Consumers trust in online transactions is crucial for the
continuous growth and development of electronic commerce. Since Business to
Consumer (B2C) ecommerce requires the consumers to engage the technologies, the
consumers face a variety of security risks. This study addressed the role of
security, privacy and risk perceptions of consumers to shop online in order to
establish a consensus among them. The analyses provided descriptive frequencies
for the research variables and for each of the study s research constructs. In
addition, the analyses were completed with factor analysis and Pearson
correlation coefficients. The findings suggested that perceived privacy of
online transaction on trust is mediated by perceived security, and consumers
trust in online transaction is significantly related with the trustworthiness
of Web vendors. Also, consumers trust is negatively associated with perceived
risks in online transactions. However, there is no significant impact from
perceived security and perceived privacy to trust in online transactions."
"Project management education programmes are often proposed in higher
education to give students competences in project planning (Gantt's chart),
project organizing, human and technical resource management, quality control
and also social competences (collaboration, communication), emotional ones
(empathy, consideration of the other, humour, ethics), and organizational ones
(leadership, political vision, and so on). This training is often given
according a training-by-project type of learning with case studies. This
article presents one course characterized by a pedagogical organization based
upon Knowledge Management (KM) concepts: knowledge transfer and construction
throughout a learning circle and social interactions. The course is supported
by a rich and complex tutor organization. We have observed this course by using
another KM method inspired from KADS with various return of experience
formalized into cards and charts. Our intention is, according to the model of
Argyris and Sch\""on (Smith, 2001), to gain feedback information about local and
global processes and about actors' experience in order to improve the course.
This paper describes precisely the course (pedagogical method and tutor
activity) and the KM observation method permitting to identify problem to
solve. In our case, we observe problem of pedacogical coordination and skills
acquisition. We propose to design a metacognitive tool for tutors and students,
usable for improving knowledge construction and learning process organisation"
"Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in
face-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better
the needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the
specific case of project management training. The results of a course
observation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools
involves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore
dissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of
knowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a
personalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or tutor)
which gives information to monitor activities and supports the acquisition and
transfer of expertise. This platform is meant for the complex educational
context of project-based learning. Indeed, as for the majority of project-based
learning activities, the articulation conceptualisation-experiment is an
important part of the process. The originality of our approach relies on also
supporting the articulation between action (experiment or conceptualisation)
and reflection. This approach so improves the acquisition of complex skills
(e.g. management, communication and collaboration), which requires a
behavioural evolution. We aim at making the students become able ?to learn to
learn' and evolve according to contexts. We facilitate their ability to have a
critical analysis of their actions according to the situations they encounter."
"One of the elements that have popularized and facilitated the use of
geographical information on a variety of computational applications has been
the use of Web maps; this has opened new research challenges on different
subjects, from locating places and people, the study of social behavior or the
analyzing of the hidden structures of the terms used in a natural language
query used for locating a place. However, the use of geographic information
under technological features is not new, instead it has been part of a
development and technological integration process. This paper presents a state
of the art review about the application of geographic information under
different approaches: its use on location based services, the collaborative
user participation on it, its contextual-awareness, its use in the Semantic Web
and the challenges of its use in natural languge queries. Finally, a prototype
that integrates most of these areas is presented."
"Innovation and technology management is an inevitable issue in the high end
technological and innovative organizations. Today, most of the innovations are
limited with developed countries like USA, Japan and Europe while developing
countries are still behind in the field of innovation and management of
technology. But it is also becoming a subject for rapid progress and
development in developing countries. Innovation and technology environment in
developing countries are by nature, problematic, characterized by poor business
models, political instability and governance conditions, low education level
and lack of world-class research universities, an underdeveloped and mediocre
physical infrastructure, and lack of solid technology based on trained human
resources. This paper provides a theoretical and conceptual framework analysis
for managing innovation and technology in developing countries like India and
China. We present the issues and challenges in innovation and technology
management and come up with proposed solutions."
"Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technology to
provide and support health care mainly for the purpose of providing
consultation. It is also a way to provide medical procedures or examinations to
remote locations. It has the potential to improve both the quality and the
access to health care services delivery while lowering costs even in the
scarcity of resources. Understanding the potentiality of telemedicine, many
developing countries are implementing telemedicine to provide health care
facility to remote area where health care facilities are deficient. Bangladesh
is not an exception to this either. In this paper we mention the reasons why
Bangladesh has to move for telemedicine. We also present the past and on-going
telemedicine activities and projects in Bangladesh. Analyzing these projects we
have found out some factors which should be assessed carefully for successful
implementation of telemedicine application. Finally we propose a prototype
telemedicine network for Bangladesh that can improve health facilities through
telemedicine by making a connection between rural health facility providers and
special hospitals."
"Microblogging is a form of online communication by which users broadcast
brief text updates, also known as tweets, to the public or a selected circle of
contacts. A variegated mosaic of microblogging uses has emerged since the
launch of Twitter in 2006: daily chatter, conversation, information sharing,
and news commentary, among others. Regardless of their content and intended
use, tweets often convey pertinent information about their author's mood
status. As such, tweets can be regarded as temporally-authentic microscopic
instantiations of public mood state. In this article, we perform a sentiment
analysis of all public tweets broadcasted by Twitter users between August 1 and
December 20, 2008. For every day in the timeline, we extract six dimensions of
mood (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) using an extended
version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a well-established psychometric
instrument. We compare our results to fluctuations recorded by stock market and
crude oil price indices and major events in media and popular culture, such as
the U.S. Presidential Election of November 4, 2008 and Thanksgiving Day. We
find that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have
a significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions
of public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a
solid platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive
value with regards to existing social as well as economic indicators."
"In this paper, we discuss the available approches of the new governance
structures of standardization, in order to propose new hypothesis on the way
computer sciences languages are dealt with. We consider the example of the XML
language and its applications in order to propose a dynamic analysis of this
governance, focusing on the coordination that is done by companies, and the
strategic usage they have of these arenas to further their goals. We advocate
the development of more of such empirical analysis in order to cover all the
perspectives of possible international policies in this area."
"Laboratory based courses play a critical role in scientific education.
Automation is changing the nature of the laboratories, and there is a long
running debate about the value of hands on versus simulated and remote
laboratories. The remote lab technology has brought a significant improvement
in communication within the Academic community and has improved students
learning experiences. There are different educational objectives as criteria
for judging the laboratories: Hands on advocates emphasize design skills, while
remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. Remote laboratories
offer all the advantages of the new technology, but are often a poor
replacement for real laboratory work. Remote laboratories are similar to
simulation techniques in that they require minimal space and time, because the
experiments can be rapidly configured and run over the Internet [Web]. But
unlike simulations, they provide real data. This paper presents a comparative
analysis for the educational objectives of the three laboratory techniques,
hands on, simulated, and remote laboratories. In addition, it proposes
enhancements for the remote lab activities leading to improving its
performance."
"Internet becomes a large and rich repository of information about us as
individually. Any thing form user profile information to friends links the user
subscribes to are reflection of social interactions as user has in real worlds.
Social networking has created new ways to communicate and share information.
Social networking websites are being used regularly by millions of people, and
it now seems that social networking will be an enduring part of everyday life.
Social networks such as Orkut, Bebo, MySpace, Flickr, Facebook, Friendster and
LinkedIn, have attracted millions of internet user who are involved in bogging,
participatory book reviewing, personal networking and photo sharing. Social
network services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal
investigations. Information posted on sites such as Orkut and Facebook has been
used by police, probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said
sites. In some situations, content posted on web social network has been used
in court. In the proposed work degree of closeness is identified by link weight
approaches and information matrices are generated and matched on the basis of
similarity in user profile information. The proposed technique is useful to
investigate a user profile and calculate closeness or interaction between
users."
"Innovation is slowing greatly in the pharmaceutical sector. It is considered
here how part of the problem is due to overly limiting intellectual property
relations in the sector. On the other hand, computing and software in
particular are characterized by great richness of intellectual property
frameworks. Could the intellectual property ecosystem of computing come to the
aid of the biosciences and life sciences? We look at how the answer might well
be yes, by looking at (i) the extent to which a drug mirrors a software
program, and (ii) what is to be gleaned from trends in research publishing in
the life and biosciences."
"The present paper describes a live project study carried out for the
universities located in the western Himalayan region of India in the year 2009.
The objective of this study is to undertake the task of assessment regarding
initiative, utilization of ICT resources, its performance and impact in these
higher educational institutions/universities. In order to answer these,
initially basic four- tier framework was prepared. Followed by a questionnaire
containing different ICT components 18 different groups like vision, planning,
implementation, ICT infrastructure and related activities exhibiting
performance. Primary data in the form of feedback on the five point scale, of
the questionnaire, was gathered from six universities of the region. A simple
statistical analysis was undertaken using weighted mean, to assess the ICT
initiative, status and performance of various universities. In the process, a
question related to Performance Indicator was identified from each group, whose
Coefficient of Correlation was calculated. This study suggests that a
progressive vision, planning and initiative regarding academic syllabi, ICT
infrastructure, used in training the skilled human resource, is going to have a
favourable impact through actual placement, research and play a dominant role
at the National and International level."
"HIV/AIDs Regimen specification one of many problems for which
bioinformaticians have implemented and trained machine learning methods such as
neural networks. Predicting HIV resistance would be much easier, but
unfortunately we rarely have enough structural information available to train a
neural network. To network model designed to predict how long the HIV patient
can prolong his/her life time with certain regimen specification. To learn this
model 300 patient's details have taken as a training set to train the network
and 100 patients medical history has taken to test this model. This network
model is trained using MAT lab implementation."
"Bubble Sort is simple. Yet, it seems a bit difficult for high school
students. This paper presents a pedagogical methodology: Using Design Sketch to
visualize the concepts in Bubble Sort, and to evaluate how this approach
assists students to understand the pseudo code of Bubble Sort. An experiment is
conducted in Wu-Ling Senior High School with 250 students taking part. The
statistical analysis of experimental results shows that, for relatively high
abstraction concepts, such as iteration number, Design Sketch helps
significantly. However, it is not so for low abstraction concepts such as
compare, swap, and iteration."
"Before contributing new knowledge, individuals must attain requisite
background knowledge or skills through schooling, training, practice, and
experience. Given limited time, individuals often choose either to focus on few
areas, where they build deep expertise, or to delve less deeply and distribute
their attention and efforts across several areas. In this paper we measure the
relationship between the narrowness of focus and the quality of contribution
across a range of both traditional and recent knowledge sharing media,
including scholarly articles, patents, Wikipedia, and online question and
answer forums. Across all systems, we observe a small but significant positive
correlation between focus and quality."
"Recently, the academic community has been giving much attention to
Cooperative Learning System, a group learning method combined with pedagogy and
social psychology. It allows group members to gain knowledge through
collaborations and interactions. Nowadays, most Internet cooperative learning
systems are designed to provide students mainly with a convenient online
environment to study theoretical courses but rarely with an online environment
to operate practical instruments. Hence, this paper designed a 3D online
cooperative learning system for operating virtual instruments with
circuit-measuring function. By integrating with Virtual Reality, Remote Control
Parameter Transmission and embedded system techniques, this system gives
learners not only a cooperative learning environment via networking to jointly
operate the 3D virtual instruments (for example, multi-meters, power supplies
and oscilloscopes) but also the functions of instant messages and 3D puzzles to
interact with one another. Therefore, learners can effectively improve learning
interests and results."
"A multiple-perspective co-citation analysis method is introduced for
characterizing and interpreting the structure and dynamics of co-citation
clusters. The method facilitates analytic and sense making tasks by integrating
network visualization, spectral clustering, automatic cluster labeling, and
text summarization. Co-citation networks are decomposed into co-citation
clusters. The interpretation of these clusters is augmented by automatic
cluster labeling and summarization. The method focuses on the interrelations
between a co-citation cluster's members and their citers. The generic method is
applied to a three-part analysis of the field of Information Science as defined
by 12 journals published between 1996 and 2008: 1) a comparative author
co-citation analysis (ACA), 2) a progressive ACA of a time series of
co-citation networks, and 3) a progressive document co-citation analysis (DCA).
Results show that the multiple-perspective method increases the
interpretability and accountability of both ACA and DCA networks."
"We have seen in last few decades that the progress of information technology
with leaps and bounds, which have completely changed the way of life in the
developed nations. While internet has changed the established working practice
and opened new vistas and provided a platform to connect, this gives the
opportunity for collaborative work space that goes beyond the global boundary.
ICT promises a fundamental change in all aspects of our lives, including
knowledge dissemination, social interaction, economic and business practices,
political engagement, media, education, health, leisure and
entertainment...This paper introduces the application of ICT for rural
development. The paper aims at improving the delivery of information to rural
masses such as, technology information, marketing information, and information
advice. This paper focuses digital divide and poverty eradication, good
governance and the significance of internet for rural development. The paper
concludes that ICTs offer the developing country, the opportunity to look ahead
several stages of rural development by the use of internet. Effective use of
ICT can demolish geographical boundaries and can bring rural communities closer
to global economic systems and be of meaningful help to the underprivileged."
"More and more people rely on Web information and with the advance of Web 2.0
technologies they can increasingly easily participate to the creation of this
information. Country-level politicians could not ignore this trend and have
started to use the Web to promote them or to demote their opponents. This paper
presents how candidates to a French mayor local election and with less budget
have engineered their Web campaign and online reputation. After presenting the
settings of the local election, the Web tools used by the different candidates
and the local journalists are detailed. These tools are evaluated from a
security point of view and the legal issues that they have created are
underlined."
"In this paper, we describe an effective framework for adapting electronic
commerce or e-commerce services in developing countries like Bangladesh. The
internet has opened up a new horizon for commerce, namely electronic commerce
(e-commerce). It entails the use of the internet in the marketing,
identification, payment and delivery of goods and services. At present internet
facilities are available in Bangladesh. Slowly, but steadily these facilities
are holding a strong position in every aspects of our life. E-commerce is one
of those sectors which need more attention if we want to be a part of global
business. Bangladesh is far-far away to adapt the main stream of e-commerce
application. Though government is shouting to take the challenges of
e-commerce, but they do not take the right step, that is why e-commerce dose
not make any real contribution in our socio-economic life. Here we propose a
model which may develop the e-commerce infrastructure of Bangladesh."
"The electronic government involves developing the informational society,
which refers to an economy and a society in which the access, acquisition,
memorizing, taking, transmitting, spreading and using the knowledge accede to a
decisive role. The informational society involves changes in the domains of
administration (e-Government), business (electronic commerce and e-business),
education (long distance education), culture (multimedia centers and virtual
libraries), mass- media (TV, video advertising panels), and in the labor manner
(tele-work and virtual commuting).The e-government refers to the interaction
between the Government, Parliament and other public institutions with the
citizens by the electronic means."
"Over the last few years electronic learning has been in use mostly by
corporate institutes in the form of computer aided instructions and computer
based training. The scope of such use has not only been limited to introductory
courses for beginners and working people but also to impart knowledge in higher
education sector. Due to increasing market demands and current prevailing law
and order situation of this area (during which the University remain closed for
uncertain period of time on many occasions) Gomal University D.I.Khan, Pakistan
is planning to introduce e-learning at undergraduate and post graduate level in
computer and management sciences for smooth and uninterrupted delivery of
quality education to local and distant students. Obvious result of elearning
will be two fold. First it will meet market demands along with smooth
uninterrupted delivery of quality education and secondly will solve the growing
problem of shortage of experts raised by the current law and order situation.
This paper investigates the main issues involved in designing and implementing
an effective electronic courseware for students with diverse backgrounds
belonging to this remote area. Some effective strategies for electronic
delivery of courses to local and distant students are also presented along with
some examples of implementation."
"Analysing Online Social Networks (OSN), voluntarily maintained and
automatically exploitable databases of electronic personal information,
promises a wealth of insight into their users' behavior, interest, and
utilization of these currently predominant services on the Internet. To
understand popularity in OSN, we monitored a large sample of profiles from a
highly popular network for three months, and analysed the relation between
profile properties and their impression frequency. Evaluating the data
indicates a strong relation between both the number of accepted contacts and
the diligence of updating contacts versus the frequency of requests for a
profile. Counter intuitively, the overall activity, gender, as well as
participation span of users have no remarkable impact on their profile's
popularity."
"E-learning with using multimedia and graphical interfaces is now fashionable
in some virtual learning environments. Especially, in open colleges,
universities and E-learning databases, using these interfaces can improve
quality of educating by increasing attraction of educational subjects. In this
paper, we introduce this technology and its aspects by defining some Graphical
User Interfaces (GUI). Improving some indexes in E-learning environments can be
measured by using GUI. Adding some plug-ins in E-learning softwares and
environments like relative sound, electronic noting paper and virtual
classrooms can be created by E-learning GUI (ELGUI) as explain in this paper."
"One of the most applied learning in virtual spaces is using E-Learning
systems. Some E-Learning methodologies has been introduced, but the main
subject is the most positive feedback from E-Learning systems. In this paper,
we introduce a new methodology of E-Learning systems entitle ""Network Learning""
with review of another aspects of E-Learning systems. Also, we present benefits
and advantages of using these systems in educating and fast learning programs.
Network Learning can be programmable for every education system and it is
flexible with too positive results."
"The European Commission has the power to inspire, initiate and sponsor huge
transnational projects to an extent impossible for most other entities. These
projects can address universal themes and develop well-being models that are
valuable across a diversity of societies and economies. It is a universal fact
that SMEs in all countries provide a substantial proportion of total
employment, and conduct much of a nation's innovative activity. Yet these
smaller companies struggle in global markets on a far from level playing field,
where large companies have distinct advantages. To redress this imbalance the
Commission saw it as a priority to improve the trading capability of the Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and perceived digital platforms as the
modern means to this end. They considered that the best operational model for a
vibrant Web2.0-based Internet services industry would be by analogy to
well-performing biological ecosystems. Open Source Software is adopted in the
DBE/OPAALS projects as the best support for sustainability of such complex
electronic webs, since it minimises interoperability problems, enables code
access for cheaper in-house modification or development of systems, and reduces
both capital and operating expenditure."
"This paper emphasizes a determinant aim of identifying different approaches,
as comparing to the education and democracy ways specific to e-government
system. Introducing the information technology should offer the possibility by
which reform processes of the government should become more efficient,
transparent and much more public for the citizens; in this way, their ability
of participating directly to government activities should prove the carrying
out of a democratic and free frame. One of the essential issues of such
phenomenon is that of proving that adopting the information and communication
technology programs to government process or electronic government depends upon
a series of external factors, such as the level of state's development, the
cultural level, the frame of developing the structures of central and local
public authority, criteria that differentiate the applicability of such system,
to various countries. This difference is especially seen as comparing to the
East states of European Union. Information systems can be applied in order to
allow the citizens to monitor and coordinate the providing of local services;
such exchanges have created trust and the feeling of influence, encouraging the
participation to political life. Carrying into effect the new informational
technologies, aiming to issuing, informing and to participation of citizens to
political life, will model the concept of democracy within a new frame."
"Cloud computing is a set of services that provide infrastructure resources
using internet media and data storage on a third party server. SMEs are said to
be the lifeblood of any vibrant economy. They are known to be the silent
drivers of a nation's economy. SMEs of India are one of the most aggressive
adopters of ERP Packages. Most of the Indian SMEs have adopted the traditional
ERP Systems and have incurred a heavy cost while implementing these systems.
This paper presents the cost savings and reduction in the level of difficulty
in adopting a cloud computing Service (CCS) enabled ERP system. For the study,
IT people from 30 North Indian SMEs were interviewed. In the cloud computing
environment the SMEs will not have to own the infrastructure so they can
abstain from any capital expenditure and instead they can utilize the resources
as a service and pay as per their usage. We consider the results of the paper
to be supportive to our proposed research concept."
"The use of agile principles and practices in software development is becoming
a powerful force in today's workplace. In our quest to develop better products,
therefore, it is imperative that we strive to learn and understand the
application of Agile methods, principles and techniques to the software
development enterprise. Unfortunately, in many educational institutions courses
and projects that emphasize Agile Software Development are minimal. At best,
students have only limited exposure to the agile philosophy, principles and
practices at the graduate and undergraduate levels of education. In an effort
to address this concern, we offered a graduate-level course entitled ""Agile
Software Engineering"" in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech in
Fall 2009. The primary objectives of the class were to introduce the values,
principles and practices underlying the agile philosophy, and to do so in an
atmosphere that encourages debate and critical thinking. The course was
designed around three central components: (1) teaching the essentials of how
one develops a product within an Agile framework, (2) having invited
presentation by notable industry experts, and (3) having students present and
discuss current research topics and issues. This paper describes our
experiences during the offering of that course, and in particular, the unique
perspectives of the class instructor, the teaching assistant and a student who
was enrolled in the class."
"The research effort on mobile computing has focused mainly on routing and
usually assumes that all mobile devices (MDs) are cooperative. These
assumptions hold on military or search and rescue operations, where all hosts
are from the same authority and their users have common goals. The application
of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as open networks has emerged recently but
proliferated exponentially. Energy is a valuable commodity in MANETs due to the
limited battery of the portable devices. Batteries typically cannot be replaced
in MANETs, making their lifetime limited. Diverse users, with unlike goals,
share the resources of their devices and ensuring global connectivity comes
very low in their priority. This sort of communities can already be found in
wired networks, namely on peer-to-peer networks. In this scenario, open MANETs
will likely resemble social environments. A group of persons can provide
benefits to each of its members as long as everyone provides his contribution.
For our particular case, each element of a MANET will be called to forward
messages and to participate on routing protocols. A selfish behavior threatens
the entire community and also this behavior is infectious as, other MDs may
also start to perform in the same way. In the extreme, this can take to the
complete sabotage of the network. This paper investigates the prevalent
malicious attacks in MANET and analyzes recent selfish trends in MANET. We
analyzed the respective strengths and vulnerabilities of the existing selfish
behaviour prevention scheme."
"This research papers examines the new technology of Holographic Projections.
It highlights the importance and need of this technology and how it represents
the new wave in the future of technology and communications, the different
application of the technology, the fields of life it will dramatically affect
including business, education, telecommunication and healthcare. The paper also
discusses the future of holographic technology and how it will prevail in the
coming years highlighting how it will also affect and reshape many other fields
of life, technologies and businesses."
"In today\^as world designing adaptable course material requires new technical
knowledge which involves a need for a uniform protocol that allows organizing
resources with emphasis on quality and Learning. This can be achieved by
bundling the resources in a known and prescribed fashion called Learning
objects. Learning Objects are composed of two aspects namely ""Learning"" and
""Object"". The Learning aspect of Learning objects refers to Education. Since
Education is a process so the primary aim of learning objects tends to be
facilitating acquisition, assessment and conversion of content into Learning
objects while fostering the assimilation of these Learning objects into
learning modules and instruction. The Object part of Learning objects relates
to the Digital Electronic format of the resources i.e. to say that it deals
with the physical resource that forms the Learning objects. The objects in LOs
are analogous to objects used in object-oriented modeling (OOM). The analogy
helps visualize how LOs will be packaged, processed and transported across the
digital library as well as utilized in course building. OOM concepts such as
encapsulation, classification, polymorphism, inheritance and reuse can be
borrowed to describe the operations on LOs in the digital library. Thus, the
aim of this paper is threefolds. Firstly, to discuss the background of this
research and the concept of Learning Objects. Secondly, to provide a framework
for adaptive mechanism for the retrieval of Learning Objects and thirdly to
highlight the benefits that this new proposed framework shall bring."
"Real Industry Projects and team work can have a great impact on student
learning but providing these activities requires significant commitment from
academics. It requires several years planning implementing to create a
collaborative learning environment that mimics the real world ICT (Information
and Communication Technology) industry workplace. In this project, staff from
all the three faculties, namely the Faculty of Health, Engineering and Science,
Faculty of Arts, Education and Human Development, and Faculty of Business and
Law in higher education work together to establish a detailed project
management plan and to develop the unit guidelines for participating students.
The proposed project brings together students from business, multimedia and
computer science degrees studying their three project-based units within each
faculty to work on a relatively large IT project with our industry partner,
Melbourne Zoo. This paper presents one multimedia software project accomplished
by one of the multi-discipline student project teams. The project was called
'Interactive ZooOz Guide' and developed on a GPS-enabled PDA device in 2007.
The developed program allows its users to navigate through the Zoo via an
interactive map and provides multimedia information of animals on hotspots at
the 'Big Cats' section of the Zoo so that it enriches user experience at the
Zoo. A recent development in zoo applications is also reviewed. This paper is
also intended to encourage academia to break boundaries to enhance students'
learning beyond classroom."
"Software Development is a core second-year course currently offered to
undergraduate students at Victoria University at its five local and
international campuses. The project aims to redesign the existing course
curriculum to support student-centred teaching and learning. It is intended to
provide a learning context in which learners can reflect on new material,
discuss their tentative understandings with others, actively search for new
information, develop skills in communication and collaboration, and build
conceptual connections to their existing knowledge base. The key feature of the
cross-campus curriculum innovation is the use of Blackboard, short for
Blackboard Learning System, to assist in course content organization and online
delivery. A well-defined and integrated case study is used throughout the
course to provide realistic practical experience of software development. It
allows students to take control of their own learning while at the same time
providing support to those students who have particular learning difficulties.
In this paper, the developed curriculum and the learning outcome are described.
The e-Learning material and various Blackboard tools used for teaching and
learning activities are presented. Finally, conclusion is drawn from classroom
experience."
"Climate change has been a popular topic for a number of years now. Computer
Science has contributed to aiding humanity in reducing energy requirements and
consequently global warming. Much of this work is through calculators which
determine a user's carbon footprint. However there are no expert systems which
can offer advice in an efficient and time saving way. There are many
publications which do offer advice on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
but to find the advice the reader seeks will involve reading a lot of
irrelevant material. This work built an expert system (which we call
EcoHomeHelper) and attempted to show that it is useful in changing people's
behaviour with respect to their GHG emissions and that they will be able to
find the information in a more efficient manner. Twelve participants were used.
Seven of which used the program and five who read and attempted to find advice
by reading from a list. The application itself has current implementations and
the concept further developed, has applications for the future."
"The development of Internet technology give a chance for application in all
kind of humans activity include education specially for higher education in
university in order to increase education quality. In this paper we will
discuss about the importance of the elements which must be fulfilled when we
build the online academic application with web technology which will help
teaching process in university. Also we will discuss to implement open source
software as foundation in order to deploy the information system with low cost
without losing the performance. In the future assembling internet technology on
education and training will be need in order to enhancement and distribution
education quality, specially in Indonesia where has many islands separate with
sea and mountain. Students and faculty will enjoy access to multiple resources
from one location, delivering search results with a range of content including
encyclopedia articles, multimedia, related Web sites, magazines, and much more.
Enables schools to implement an online academic program. It equips schools to
host online courses, conduct live and blog-style communication between faculty
and students, track grades, automate test scoring, store course materials, and
much more."
"Serious games have recently emerged as an avenue for curriculum delivery.
Serious games incorporate motivation and entertainment while providing pointed
curriculum for the user. This paper presents a serious game, called MiBoard,
currently being developed from the iSTART Intelligent Tutoring System. MiBoard
incorporates a multiplayer interaction that iSTART was previously unable to
provide. This multiplayer interaction produces a wide variation across game
trials, while also increasing the repeat playability for users. This paper
presents a demonstration of the MiBoard system and the expectations for its
application."
"This paper analyses changes in public opinion by tracking political
discussions in which people voluntarily engage online. Unlike polls or surveys,
our approach does not elicit opinions but approximates what the public thinks
by analysing the discussions in which they decide to take part. We measure the
emotional content of online discussions in three dimensions (valence, arousal
and dominance), paying special attention to deviation around average values,
which we use as a proxy for disagreement and polarisation. We show that this
measurement of public opinion helps predict presidential approval rates,
suggesting that there is a point of connection between online discussions
(often deemed not representative of the overall population) and offline polls.
We also show that this measurement provides a deeper understanding of the
individual mechanisms that drive aggregated shifts in public opinion. Our data
spans a period that includes two US presidential elections, the attacks of
September 11, and the start of military action in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"The huge information flow currently available to young generation makes it
difficult for educational centers to train them as needed. Most of these
information flows occur in transportation time or while on public areas.
Competing with commercial information streams is far out of educational centers
time and budget. For creating enough mobile applications for vast educational
mobile content broadcasting that can match young spirits as well, we designed
and developed the ARMrayan Multimedia Mobile CMS as the software that helps
communities, educational, cultural or marketing centers in a way that ordinary
operators be able to create a variety of fully functional multimedia mobile
applications such as tutorials, catalogues, books, and guides in minutes
without writing even a line of code. In this paper, we present the role of our
developed software in our proposed vast educational content broadcasting system
using kiosks and Bluetooth advertising, which will lead to a great leap in
M-commerce marketing and public education solutions. Related experiences are
described and diagrams are used to illustrate the solution. Upon release of the
software, it achieved two titles and prizes in different festivals and various
cultural and commercial centers became its customers."
"Our work aims to study tools offered to students and tutors involved in
face-to-face or blended project- based learning activities. Project-based
learning is often applied in the case of complex learning (i.e. which aims at
making learners acquire various linked skills or develop their behaviours). In
comparison to traditional learning, this type of learning relies on
co-development, collective responsibility and co-operation. Learners are the
principal actors of their learning. These trainings rest on rich and complex
organizations, particularly for tutors, and it is difficult to apply innovative
educational strategies. Our aim, in a bottom-up approach, is (1) to observe,
according to Knowledge Management methods, a course characterized by these
three criteria. The observed course concerns project management learning. Its
observation allows us (2) to highlight and to analyze the problems encountered
by the actors (students, tutors, designers) and (3) to propose tools to solve
or improve them. We particularly study the relevance and the limits of the
existing monitoring and experience sharing tools. We finally propose a result
in the form of the tool MEShaT (Monitoring and Experience Sharing Tool) and end
on the perspectives offered by these researches."
"In a typical Event-Based Surveillance setting, a stream of web documents is
continuously monitored for disease reporting. A structured representation of
the disease reporting events is extracted from the raw text, and the events are
then aggregated to produce signals, which are intended to represent early
warnings against potential public health threats.
  To public health officials, these warnings represent an overwhelming list of
""one-size-fits-all"" information for risk assessment. To reduce this overload,
two techniques are proposed. First, filtering signals according to the user's
preferences (e.g., location, disease, symptoms, etc.) helps reduce the
undesired noise. Second, re-ranking the filtered signals, according to an
individual's feedback and annotation, allows a user-specific, prioritized
ranking of the most relevant warnings.
  We introduce an approach that takes into account this two-step process of: 1)
filtering and 2) re-ranking the results of reporting signals. For this,
Collaborative Filtering and Personalization are common techniques used to
support users in dealing with the large amount of information that they face."
"Among the various types of online language learner collective types, we
analyze in this contribution Web 2.0 communities featuring an explicit
progression. We use three analysis angles (user roles, pedagogical progression
and content) in order to provides leads towards expressing the interrelations
between the implementation choices regarding the concepts linked to Web 2.0 and
the learning experience of the users."
"Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) involves the use of wireless technology to
replace copper to connect subscribers to the telephone network. It is a variant
of wireless broadband which provides an alternative in the so-called 'last
mile' connectivity between the subscriber and the fixed telecommunications
network. FWA could either be narrowband or broadband and it is predominantly
deployed using the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. In
assessing the extent of development and deployment of FWA, the perspective of
the operators and users was elicited primarily through the use of
questionnaires. Issues like setup cost, tax, Government incentive, availability
of infrastructure and manpower applied to the operators while on the users'
part factors like quality of service, signal strength as well as call rate were
considered. The South western zone of Nigeria is regarded as one of the most
urbanized regions in the south of Sahara, this is not out of place considering
the fact that Lagos which is the nation's commercial nerve centre and a
mega-city is located within this region. The scope of this research covered
this very lively part of the country. The relationship between the parameters
or variables considered was established using an appropriate statistical
method: The Regression analysis. In terms of users' preference, Global System
of Mobile communication (GSM) was compared with FWA. Results were interpreted
and suitable conclusions were drawn to wrap up a quite revealing work."
"In the info-tech age E-Methods of learning are becoming the most important
vehicle in disseminating knowledge in higher education institutions. This
sector is growing and changing at a rapid speed due to developments in
technologies. But teaching is an art. Can there be fun learning with raw and
dry technology? How can we make the best use of E- Methods, can we make the
required information and data available to the students in a flexible manner,
at ease all the time? What are the advantages of traditional methods of
teaching and learning? Is E-learning a progressive stage incubating all the
benefits of the Manual learning or it is only a window dressing on the face of
advancement? Can we convert the boring, tedious subjects into interactive,
monotony breaking joyous learning? In this paper the researchers have focused
on the modernization of E- Pedagogy vis-a-vis the traditional method of
learning. They have highlighted the effectiveness of using the E- learning
elements and various E- Methods. This work has used the decision tree
algorithms particularly Classifiers.trees.J48 The obtained results show that
using online examination attribute plays major role in increasing the average
grade of the class in higher education. The novelty of this work is that the
researchers have focused on the teaching methodology used by the faculty
members and the tools available in the universities. We believe that this work
will play a constructive role in building higher education system. Our
generated rules/output can be used by the decision makers in the improvement of
higher education system processes."
"The greatness of any nation depends largely on the system of education that
is used to nurture its talent from within. With the digital era taking the
spotlight, and the world rapidly reforming into a global village, it is now
quintessential that a spirit of healthy competitiveness be inculcated in the
budding minds of this country. While trying to remodel and upgrade the
education system, a key issue is that of quality of education processes in the
country. Needs and expectations of the society are changing very fast and the
quality of higher education requires to be sustained at the desired level. The
use of internet for educational purposes has increased many folds among Indian
youths. Online video lectures and e-books are the emerging trends among
learners. The birth of high speed internet access and its availability on
recently evolved smart phones has opened several new avenues for learning. The
growing popularity of these smart phones among the youth can potentially
revolutionize the way we learn. The introduction of 3G technology is already
being pinned as the next big thing in the mobile internet revolution. This
paper discusses the use of Smart Phones in Education Technology and its
application in Technical & Professional studies in India. We intend to put
forward some challenges and advices."
"This paper deals with how to manage effectively in the design, implementation
and support of an IT infrastructure at an enterprise level. This particular
management is lacking in today's IT infrastructure scenario. Just
implementation is not sufficient for an NON-IT industry, they need a proper
support in the infrastructure like documentation, support work flow, ticketing
systems (used for IT related issue either hardware or software) etc... Many
organizations spend a lot of money for this support and they expect a lot from
the provider. Many providers sign in the SLA that they will provide them with
an excellent support, but 80-90% it doesn't happen. Many times they don't meet
the expectations of their client. So how to make these expectations being met
100% for the client? That is what is going to be discussed in this paper with
respect to ITIL framework and other technical terminologies."
"On October 23rd 2011, around 22'000 voters will be authorized to cast their
votes electronically in occasion of the elections to the National Council.
These are the first trials ever with e-voting in elections at federal level in
Switzerland. Four cantons are going to conduct trials with this new channel.
Only Swiss voters living abroad will be authorized to participate. The Swiss
Confederation pursues the long term goal of the introduction of e-voting as a
third, complementary voting method - in addition to voting in person at the
polling station and postal voting."
"The future of mobile wireless communication networks will include existing
3rd generation, 4th generation (implemented in Japan, USA, South Korea etc.),
5th generation (based on cognitive radio which implies the whole wireless world
interconnection & WISDOM - Wireless innovative System for Dynamic Operating
Megacommunications concept), 6th generation (with very high data rates Quality
of Service (QoS) and service applications) and 7th generation (with space
roaming). This paper is focused on the specifications of future generations and
latest technologies to be used in future wireless mobile communication
networks. However keeping in view the general poor masses of India, some of the
future generation technologies will be embedded with 2G and 2.5G so that
general masses may get the advantage of internet, multimedia services and the
operators may get proper revenues with little extra expenditure in the existing
mobile communication networks."
"In the prevailing cellular environment, it is important to provide the
resources for the fluctuating traffic demand exactly in the place and at the
time where and when they are needed. In this paper, we explored the ability of
hierarchical cellular structures with inter layer reuse to increase the
capacity of mobile communication network by applying total frequency hopping
(T-FH) and adaptive frequency allocation (AFA) as a strategy to reuse the macro
and micro cell resources without frequency planning in indoor pico cells [11].
The practical aspects for designing macro- micro cellular overlays in the
existing big urban areas are also explained [4]. Femto cells are inducted in
macro / micro / pico cells hierarchical structure to achieve the required QoS
cost effectively."
"Nowadays, E-learning system is considered as one of the main pillars in the
learning system. Mainly, E-Learning system is designed to serve different types
of students. Thus, providing different learning pathways are a must. In this
paper, we introduce the variability technique to represent the knowledge in
E-learning system. This representation provides different learning pathways
which supports the students' diversity. Moreover, we validate the selection of
learning pathway by introducing First Order Logic (FOL) rules. Keywords

"South Africa assumes a significant position in the insurance landscape of
Africa. The present research based upon qualitative and quantitative analysis,
shows that it shows the characteristics of a Complex Adaptive System. In
addition, a statistical analysis of risk measures through Value at risk and
Conditional tail expectation is carried out to show how an individual insurance
company copes under external complexities. The authors believe that an
explanation of the coping strategies, and the subsequent managerial
implications would enrich our understanding of complexity in business."
"Researchers often face the problem of needing to protect the privacy of
subjects while also needing to integrate data that contains personal
information from diverse data sources in order to conduct their research. The
advent of computational social science and the enormous amount of data about
people that is being collected makes protecting the privacy of research
subjects evermore important. However, strict privacy procedures can make
joining diverse sources of data that contain information about specific
individual behaviors difficult. In this paper we present a procedure to keep
information about specific individuals from being ""leaked"" or shared in either
direction between two sources of data. To achieve this goal, we randomly assign
individuals to anonymous groups before combining the anonymized information
between the two sources of data. We refer to this method as the Yahtzee
procedure, and show that it performs as expected theoretically when we apply it

"Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in
face-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better
the needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the
specific case of project management training. The results of a course
observation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools
involves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore
dissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of
knowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a
personalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or
tutor), which gives information to monitor activities and supports the
acquisition and transfer of expertise. This platform is based on Knowledge
Management (KM) and Web 2.0 concepts to support the dynamic building of
knowledge. KM is used to define the learning process (based on the experiential
learning theory) and the way the individual knowledge building is monitored
(based on metacognitive concepts). Web 2.0 is used to define the way the
experience is shared. We make the hypothesis that this approach improves the
acquisition of complex skills (e.g. management, communication and
collaboration), which requires a behavioural evolution. We aim at making the
students become able 'to learn to learn' and evolve according to contexts. We
facilitate their ability to have a critical analysis of their actions according
to the situations they encounter."

"Web Accessibility for disabled people has posed a challenge to the civilized
societies that claim to uphold the principles of equal opportunity and
nondiscrimination. Certain concrete measures have been taken to narrow down the
digital divide between normal and disabled users of Internet technology. The
efforts have resulted in enactment of legislations and laws and mass awareness
about the discriminatory nature of the accessibility issue, besides the efforts
have resulted in the development of commensurate technological tools to develop
and test the Web accessibility. World Wide Web consortium's (W3C) Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has framed a comprehensive document comprising
of set of guidelines to make the Web sites accessible to the users with
disabilities. This paper is about the issues and aspects surrounding Web
Accessibility. The details and scope are kept limited to comply with the aim of
the paper which is to create awareness and to provide basis for in-depth
investigation."
"We tested Rousseau's (in press) recent proposal to define percentile classes
in the case of the Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) so that the largest number
in a set always belongs to the highest (100th) percentile rank class. In the
case a set of nine uncited papers and one with citation, however, the uncited
papers would all be placed in the 90th percentile rank. A lowly-cited document
set would thus be advantaged when compared with a highly-cited one.
Notwithstanding our reservations, we extended the program for computing I3 in
Web-of-Science data (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/i3) with this
option; the quantiles without a correction are now the default. As Rousseau
mentions, excellence indicators (e.g., the top-10%) can be considered as
special cases of I3: only two percentile rank classes are distinguished for the
evaluation. Both excellence and impact indicators can be tested statistically
using the z-test for independent proportions."
"In this paper we present a novel model for governing societies based on
modern information technology, which neither relies on manual bureaucratic
labor, nor depends on process-based e-government services for governance. We
expose the flaws of the later and argue that it is not feasible for sustainable
governance due to permanently changing laws and instead propose a model in
which people can govern themselves in a self-service manner by relying on
constellations of data stored in a network of governmental databases to which
citizen and officials have read- and write access under rules defined by
temporary valid law."
"The Secure SQL Server - SecSS, is a technology primarily developed to enable
self-service governance of states, as described in (Paulin 2012). Self-service
governance is a novel model of governance that rejects service-based public
administration and instead proposes that governed subjects manage their legal
relations in a self-service manner, based on ad-hoc determination of
eligibilities. In this article we describe the prototype SecSS and its
evaluation in a complex governmental scenario."
"To have command over increasingly complicated social, political, economic and
environmental challenges, fragmentary knowledge, or rather the simple
accumulation of basic research is inadequate (Kim). International affairs
professionals operating in government, academia and the private sector are
progressively more aware that access to, and the blending of, interdisciplinary
policy-related knowledge is critical to effective problem solving and
decision-making. But how can one do so effectively?"
"New product development needs new engineering approaches. Knowledge is a key
resource that impacts traditional, organisational, economic and innovative
models. Through NICT (New Information and Communication Technologies),
globalisation encourages the emergence of networks that overcome traditional
organisation boundaries. International enterprises, European-Community Networks
of Excellence or Clusters (competitiveness poles) indicate the need to define a
new way of thinking. This new way moves towards an agile, continuous innovative
use of knowledge. Based on an epistemic study of knowledge management best
practices, four examples show the barriers that can be encountered today. This
paper aims defining the key elements that enhance collaborative networks. The
analysis of best practices from collaborative environments enables the design
of high standard information systems and initiate knowledge ecosystems. A
balance between formalism required to share knowledge and fuzziness of social
networks triggers new initiatives. This ensures the validity of information
exchange through virtual collaboration. It helps to maintain group coherence
despite exceeding the natural maximum number of collaborators. Finally the main
success or failure factors are highlights and commented to ease the transition
from economic-driven to expertise-driven models is then facilitated."
"There is no doubt that Search Engines are playing a great role in Internet
usage. But all the top search engines Google, Yahoo and Bing are having a
critical flaw called ""Openness of a Search Engine"". An Internet user should be
allowed to get the search results only when requested through Search engine's
web page but the user must not be allowed to get the search results when
requested through any web page that does not belong to the Search Engine. Only
results of a search engine should be available to the Internet user but not the
Search Engine. This paper explains the critical flaw called ""Openness of Search
Engine"" with a case study on top 3 search engines 'Google', 'Yahoo' and 'Bing'.
This paper conducts an attack based test using J2EE framework and proves that
'Google' passed the test and it strongly protects its Critical Search System,
where 'Yahoo' and 'Bing' are failed to protect their Search Engines. But
previously 'Google' also had other high severity issues with the Openness of
search engine; this paper reveals those issues also. Finally this paper appeals
strongly to the all top Search Engines to fix their critical flaws of ""Openness
of Search Engine""."
"To give a georeference means to give a reference as existing in the physical
space of Earth. This procedure is widely used for the location of
archaeological, historical and other sites when geographic information systems
(GIS) are used. Here we are proposing to georeference the lives of famous
people (in the paper, Newton and Schiaparelli) for teaching purposes, to
increase the appeal of some scientific disciplines."
"This paper intends to introduce a game-based 3D Virtual Learning Environment
(VLE) to second graders. The impetus arose from the need to make learning in
mathematics more effective and interesting through multimedia. Applied in a
game, the basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division are expected to performed by learners as they
represent themselves as avatars while they immerse in a quest of digital
objects in the VLE called Math World. Educational attributes such as mentality
change, emotional fulfillment, knowledge enhancement, thinking skills
development, and bodily coordination are evaluated to ensure learning
effectiveness. Also, game playability measured in terms of game plays, story,
mechanics and interface usability are examined for its educative design. With
an aggregate of these enhanced indices, results attest that objectives were met
while making mathematics an interesting, motivating and enjoyable subject,
hence VLE a significant tool to complement the conventional approaches of
teaching."
"The objectives of this paper are to identify and analyse the extent to which
the site is fulfilling all the user's requirements and needs. The related works
comprise the history of interactive design and the benefits of user-centered
development, which is the methodology followed in this survey. Moreover, there
is a brief comparison between Waterfall and User-centered methodology in terms
of addressing the issues of time saving and addressing fulfilment of users'
needs. The data required to conduct this study was acquired using two research
methods; the questionnaire and direct user observation, in order to address all
the performance related attributes in the usability stage of the evaluation. An
evaluation of the website, based on statements of usability goals and criteria,
was undertaken in relation to the implementation and testing of the new design.
JARIR bookstore website was chosen as a case study in this paper to investigate
the usability and interactivity of the website design. The analysis section
includes needs, users and tasks and data analysis, whereas the design phase
covers the user interface and database design. At the end of this paper, some
recommendations are presented regarding JARIR website that can be taken into
account when developing the website in the future."
"This communication presents the genesis and the implementation of a teacher
module, which is included in an Assistance Tool (AT). The teacher module is
based on a teacher model for which we did a thorough analysis of the state of
the art. The aim of the AT is to help a teacher to design pedagogical devices.
Teachers can formulate their needs (assistance in the design) and the AT can
relieve them from repetitive tasks related to the deployment of a teaching
device (assistance in the deployment)."
"Cloud computing is the new technology that has various advantages and it is
an adoptable technology in this present scenario. The main advantage of the
cloud computing is that this technology reduces the cost effectiveness for the
implementation of the Hardware, software and License for all. This is the
better peak time to analyze the cloud and its implementation and better use it
for the development of the quality and low cost education for all over the
world. In this paper, we discuss how to influence on cloud computing and
influence on this technology to take education to a wider mass of students over
the country. We believe cloud computing will surely improve the current system
of education and improve quality at an affordable cost."

"Of late, mobile technology has introduced new, novel environment that can be
capitalized to further enrich the teaching and learning process in classrooms.
Taking cognizance of this promising setting, a study was undertaken to
investigate the impact of such an environment enabled by android platform on
the learning process among undergraduates of Sultan Idris Education University,
Malaysia; in particular, this paper discusses critical aspects of the design
and implementation of the android learning system. Data were collected through
a survey involving 56 respondents, and these data were analyzed by using SPSS
12.0. Findings showed that the respondents were very receptive to the
interactivity, accessibility, and convenience of the system, but they were
quite frustrated with the occasional interruptions due to internet connectivity
problems. Overall, the mobile learning system can be utilized as an inexpensive
but potent learning tool that complements undergraduates' learning process."
"In the prevailing scenario audio, video, data services (i.e. internet),
multimedia and broadcasting etc. are being integrated. Decreasing cell size
increases capacity but at the same time increases fluctuation and interference
too. The intelligence approach is the only answer in developing countries where
frequency and power are scarce resources. In this paper, we have tried to
integrate all proven technologies in networking such as in-building network,
micro zone, intelligent micro cell, deployment along city streets, tunnels,
subway coverage etc. along with adaptive frequency allocation in hierarchical
approach with the help of adaptive / intelligent antenna system. A-SDMA
approach will further enhance spectral efficiency as well as QoS (Quality of
Service). It can be proved beyond doubt that this integrated approach will
convert 2G / 2.5G systems capable of handling the prevailing demand at reduced
cost. In addition to it, integrated approach will save power and reduce RF
pollution. In this paper we have explained the ill effect of cellular growth in
terms of health hazard and increased power consumption. We have also suggested
ways and means to overcome these problems (spectral density / capacity, QoS,
power consumption and RF pollution etc.)."
"As the mobile telecommunication systems are growing tremendously all over the
world, the numbers of handheld and base stations are also rapidly growing and
it became very popular to see these base stations distributed everywhere in the
neighborhood and on roof tops which has caused a considerable amount of panic
to the public in Palestine concerning wither the radiated electromagnetic
fields from these base stations may cause any health effect or hazard. Recently
UP High Court in India ordered for removal of BTS towers from residential area,
it has created panic among cellular communication network designers too. Green
cellular networks could be a solution for the above problem. This paper deals
with green cellular networks with the help of multi-layer overlaid hierarchical
structure (macro / micro / pico / femto cells). Macrocell for area coverage,
micro for pedestrian and a slow moving traffic while pico for indoor use and
femto for individual high capacity users. This could be the answer of the
problem of energy conservation and enhancement of spectral density also."
"This paper describes the process of the conception of a software tool of TELE
management. The proposed management tool combines information from two sources:
i) the automatic reports produced by the Learning Content Management System
(LCMS) Blackboard and ii) the views of students and teachers on the use of the
LCMS in the process of teaching and learning. The results show that the
architecture of the proposed management tool has the features of a management
tool, since its potential to control, to reset and to enhance the use of an
LCMS in the process of teaching and learning and teacher training, is shown."
"Many customer services are already available at Social Network Sites (SNSs),
including user recommendation and media interaction, to name a few. There are
strong desires to provide online users more dedicated and personalized services
that fit into individual's need, usually strongly depending on the inner
personalities of the user. However, little has been done to conduct proper
psychological analysis, crucial for explaining the user's outer behaviors from
their inner personality. In this paper, we propose an approach that intends to
facilitate this line of research by directly predicting the so called Big-Five
Personality from user's SNS behaviors. Comparing to the conventional
inventory-based psychological analysis, we demonstrate via experimental studies
that users' personalities can be predicted with reasonable precision based on
their online behaviors. Except for proving some former behavior-personality
correlation results, our experiments show that extraversion is positively
related to one's status republishing proportion and neuroticism is positively
related to the proportion of one's angry blogs (blogs making people angry)."
"With the advance of industrial mass production, modern micro-electronics and
computers, the intervals between the release of new generations of consumer
products have been dramatically reduced and so have their lifetime cycles.
While it was very natural in the post-war era, that sophisticated consumer
products like television sets and stereo equipment would not be replaced with a
new product until they break, and usually beyond that point since it was very
common to have a broken television set serviced, the habits of consumers have
changed during the last quarter of the 20th century.
  A modern consumer product, like Apple's famous iPhone has a market life of
approximately one year until a successor is announced and subsequently pushed
into the market. Usually these new generations bring a bunch of new features,
have a higher performance while maintaining the price or becoming even cheaper,
thus the consumer greatly benefits from the reduced lifetime cycle of these
products.
  However, electronic devices not only require a lot of of Earth's limited
resources for their production, but their production processes are a major
source for harmful climate gases like carbon dioxide and toxic waste like heavy
metal alloys, acids and alkalis. And last but not least is every obsoleted
iPhone a candidate for waste facilities unless consumers are going to sell them
on the second hand market.
  While we can not expect consumers and manufacturers to go back to the early
days of consumer products where lifetime cycles reached up to 20 years, the
world record being the famous ""Centennial Lightbulb"" in Livermore, CA in the
US, which has been lit for over 100 years, it is certainly about time to
rethink modern consumerism with regard to responsibility to future generations."
"In the last two decades, number of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) grows
in leaps and bounds. This causes a cut throat competition among these
institutions while attracting the student get admission in these institutions.
To make reach up to the students institution makes effort of advertisement.
Similarly developing and developed both type of institution launch several
services also to attract students. Most of the institutions are opened in self
finance mode. So all time they feel short hand in expenditure. Now a day a
number of advertisement methods are available. So it is difficult for an
institution to make advertisement through all modes and launch all services at
the same time due to different constraints. In this paper we use support and
confidence method to find out the best way of advertisement."
"Personal health record (PHR) management is under new scrutiny as private
companies move into the market and government agencies actively address
perceived health care distribution inequalities and inefficiencies. Current
systems are coarse-grained and provide consumers very little actual control
over their data. Herein, we propose an alternative system for managing the use
of healthcare information. This novel system is finer grained, allows for data
mining and repackaging, and gives users more control over their data, allowing
it to be distributed to their specifications. In this paper, we outline the
characteristics of such a system in different contexts, present relevant
background information and research leading to the system design, and cover
specific usage scenarios supported by this system that are difficult to control
using simpler access control strategies."
"This paper introduces AntiPlag, an advanced plagiarism detection tool
intended for use on student texts. It is capable of both hermetic detection
that scrutinizes only local collections of documents (other students' texts and
lecture materials, for example) and web plagiarism detection, in which the aim
is at identifying instances of plagiarism that have been sourced from the
Internet. The main feature of the system is the sampling-based web plagiarism
detection, a novel approach to plagiarism detection that is based on combining
web and hermetic search technologies. The system uses standard web search
engines to locate documents on the Internet that might have been used as
sources of plagiarism by the writer of a text. During this sampling phase, the
suspected sources are downloaded, converted to ASCII text and saved to the
local database so that they can be later processed by using the hermetic
detection methods. We evaluated the system by using a test set that contained
instances of verbatim copying as well as texts in which plagiarism was
concealed by minor editing, replacing words with synonyms and by paraphrasing.
We compared the results achieved by AntiPlag to an earlier evaluation study of
four web plagiarism detection systems, SafeAssignment, TurnitIn, EVE2 and
Plagiarism-Finder. AntiPlag performed better than any of these systems,
achieving the accuracy 95.8% over all the test items."
"This paper describes a method for providing feedback about the degree of
complexity that is present in particular texts. Both the method and the
software tool called TexComp are designed for use during the assessment of
student compositions (such as essays and theses). The method is based on a
cautious approach to the application of readability and lexical diversity
formulas for reasons that are analyzed in detail in this paper. We evaluated
the tool by using USE and BAWE, two corpora of texts that originate from
students who use English as a medium of instruction."
"This paper introduces the concept of the semi-automatic assessment of student
texts that aims at offering the twin benefits of fully automatic grading and
feedback together with the advantages that can be provided by human assessors.
This paper concentrates on the pedagogical foundations of the model by
demonstrating how the relevant findings in research into written composition
and writing education have been taken into account in the model design."
"In the presence of great social diversity in India, it is difficult to change
the social background of students, parents and their economical conditions.
Therefore the only option left for us is to provide uniform or standardize
teaching learning resources or methods. For high quality education throughout
India there must be some nation-wide network, which provides equal quality
education to all students, including the student from the rural areas and
villages. The one and only simple solution to this is Web Based e-Learning. In
this paper we try to give some innovative ideas to spread the Web Based
e-Learning (WBeL) concept in to the minds of young India along with various
approaches taken or to be taken, associated to it till date besides of
instructional design models, different course developmental models, the role of
technical writing and merit-demerit of WBeL till date."
"The main aim of this paper is to achieve a depth of understanding of the
various similarities and differences in terms of challenges between developed
and developing countries and in regards to the implementation of ICT
innovations. Indeed, advances in Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs) have brought many innovations to the field of Information Systems (IS).
Despite agreements on their importance to the success of organizations, the
implementation processes of such innovations are multifaceted and require
proper addressing of a wide-spread issues and challenges. In this study, we
address this matter by first; synthesizing a comprehensive body of recent and
classified literature concerningfive ICTinitiatives,second;analyzing and
classifying ICTs challenges forboth developed and developing countries as well
as justifying their similarities and differences following thematic analysis
qualitative methods, and third; presenting the study conclusions and
identifying future research areas drawn upon theconducted comparative analysis."
"Digitally engaged communities can be described as communities created and
evolved within Web 2.0 Websites such as Facebook, Bebo, and Twitter. The
growing importance of digitally engaged communities calls for the need to
efficiently manage the building blocks of sustaining a healthy community. The
initial operation of any digitally-engaged community depends on the existence
of its own members, the beneficial values created and exchanged, and the
relationships interlinking both. However, the level of contribution and
involvement might vary depending on the benefits being gratified from engaging
in such communities. In other words, motivations for participating and getting
involved are purposive; individuals are driven into joining and /or taking part
in any digitallyengaged network for capturing and purtaining certain beneficial
values. Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework that classifies the values
created and exchanged within these communities as well as the roles adopted and
played by users of these communities. Utilizing ethnography as the primay
methodological strategy to study Bebo digitally-engaged community, this
research identifies five different roles of users: Newbie, Lurker, Novice,
Insider, and Leader. Moreover, the research also identifies five value elements
that could be captured by different users: Social, Hedonic, Epistemic, Gift,
and Utilitarian. The results of this study provides insights for decision and
policy makers, service providers, and developers; as it inspires them in
knowing and meeting the needs and values of participants based on the roles
adopted by users."
"An approach for engineering student exercises using the Internet is
described. In this approach, for a given exercise, each student receives the
same problem, but with different data. The exercise content can be static or
dynamic, and the dynamic form can be timeless or real-time. The implementation
provides immediate feedback to the students, letting them know if their
submitted answers are correct. Student results for each exercise are recorded
in log files which are available to the instructor. Example exercises from
engineering computer security and cryptography courses are presented."
"Cyber-crime targeting children such as online pedophile activity are a major
and a growing concern to society. A deep understanding of predatory chat
conversations on the Internet has implications in designing effective solutions
to automatically identify malicious conversations from regular conversations.
We believe that a deeper understanding of the pedophile conversation can result
in more sophisticated and robust surveillance systems than majority of the
current systems relying only on shallow processing such as simple word-counting
or key-word spotting.
  In this paper, we study pedophile conversations from the perspective of
online grooming theory and perform a series of linguistic-based empirical
analysis on several pedophile chat conversations to gain useful insights and
patterns. We manually annotated 75 pedophile chat conversations with six stages
of online grooming and test several hypothesis on it. The results of our
experiments reveal that relationship forming is the most dominant online
grooming stage in contrast to the sexual stage. We use a widely used
word-counting program (LIWC) to create psycho-linguistic profiles for each of
the six online grooming stages to discover interesting textual patterns useful
to improve our understanding of the online pedophile phenomenon. Furthermore,
we present empirical results that throw light on various aspects of a pedophile
conversation such as probability of state transitions from one stage to
another, distribution of a pedophile chat conversation across various online
grooming stages and correlations between pre-defined word categories and online
grooming stages."
"The last decade, online activism has vastly grown. In the current digital
society, from time to time citizens decide to express their opinion by
attacking large corporations digitally in some way. Where the activists claim
this to be a digital assembly, others see it as criminal offences.
  In this paper, we will explore the legal and technical borders of the digital
right to assembly. By doing so, we can gain insight into digital manifestations
and make up the balance on the digital right to assembly. As an additional
contribution, we will discuss how the digital right to assembly could be
granted and which legal and technical requirements should be set for a digital
assembly."

"Natural crises form a big threat on environment; these crises mean the loss
of enterprises and individuals, and therefore losses in the sum total of
community development. Management to these crises is required through a crisis
management plan to control the crises before, during, and after the event. One
of the most needed things to consider during preparing the crisis management
plan is preparing the evacuation plan in order to transfer people from the
incident place to a safe place; this must be done quickly and carefully.
Because of the geographic nature of the evacuation process, Geographical
Information System (GIS) has been used widely and effectively for over 20 years
in the field of crisis management in general and in evacuation planning in
particular. This paper provides an overview about evacuation process and the
basic concepts of GIS systems. The paper also demonstrates the importance of
evacuation planning and how GIS systems used in other studies to assists in
evacuation process."
"This paper presents the results of a study carried out to identify the
factors that influence the further education desires of Sri Lankan youth.
Statistical modeling has been initially used to infer the desires of the youth
and then a decision support tool has been developed based on the statistical
model developed. In order to carry out the analysis and the development of the
model, data collected as part of the National Youth Survey has been used. The
accuracy of the model and the decision support tool has been tested by using a
random data sets and the accuracy was found to be well above 80 percent, which
is sufficient for any policy related decision making."
"In the recent years, the entire world has seen a tremendous increase in the
elderly population. Even though countries differ in the numerical criterion for
defining the old age, the UN has agreed that the cutoff of 60+ years refers to
the older population. When the percentage of older population increases in a
country, the country faces new challenges in the form of economical as well as
social impacts. The economic impacts are felt in the form of a shortfall in
labor supply, income, household savings while an increase in the payment of
retirement benefits and healthcare expenditures. On the social side, the
elderly population feels continuously isolated due to the changes in the value
system. The United Nations has identified five quality of life characteristics
for the elderly in its 1991 resolution named the United Nations Principles for
Older Persons. In this paper the authors initially look at the trends in the
increase of aged population in Asia in general and Sri Lanka in particular.
Then they discuss how the quality of life characteristics can be achieved in a
cost effective way through the use of Information and Communication Technology
(ICT). The authors take an in depth look at the recent developments in field of
ICT and its penetration in developing countries especially Sri Lanka with
special emphasis to constraints and challenges in adopting ICT for the
improving the quality of life of elderly."
"This paper presents a model conceptual framework that is aimed at promoting
trust in the online retailing environment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
Despite rapid Internet growth, the development of online retailing in Saudi
Arabia continues to progress very slowly compared to that of the developed and
leading developing countries. To determine the reason behind the sluggish
growth of online retailing in the KSA, a mixed methods study involving
retailers and customers was conducted in four stages. The outcomes of the study
point to distrust in the online retailing environment in Saudi Arabia as a key
inhibitory factor for growth. As such, a five-part model is proposed to promote
trust in the online shopping environment in the KSA."
"This paper explores the issues that influence online retailing in Saudi
Arabia. Retailers in Saudi Arabia have been reserved in their adoption of
electronically delivered aspects of their business. Despite the fact that Saudi
Arabia has the largest and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces in the Arab
region, e-commerce activities are not progressing at the same speed. Only very
few Saudi companies, mostly medium and large companies from the manufacturing
sector, are involved in e-commerce implementation. Based on qualitative data
collected by conducting interviews with 16 retailers and 16 potential customers
in Saudi Arabia, several factors influencing online retailing diffusion in
Saudi Arabia are identified. However, government support comes the highest and
most influencing factor for online retailing growth as identified by both
parties; retailers and potential customers in Saudi Arabia."
"This paper presents findings from a study of e-commerce adoption by Small and
Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. Only tiny number of Saudi commercial
organizations, mostly medium and large companies from the manufacturing sector,
in involved in e-commerce implementation. The latest report released in 2010 by
The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) in Saudi Arabia
shows that only 8% of businesses sell online. Accordingly new research has been
conducted to explore to what extent electronic mall (e-mall) would enable SMEs
in Saudi Arabia to adopt and use online channels for their sales. A
quantitative analysis of responses obtained from a survey of 108 SMEs in Saudi
Arabia was conducted. The main results of the current analysis demonstrate the
significant of organizational factors, and technology and environmental
factors. Interestingly, traditional & cultural factors have no significance in
this regard."
"This paper presents the preliminary findings of a study researching the
diffusion and the adoption of online retailing in Saudi Arabia. It reports new
research that identifies and explores the key issues that positively and
negatively influence retailers in Saudi Arabia regarding the adoption of
electronic commerce. Retailers in Saudi Arabia have been reserved in their
adoption of electronically delivered aspects of their business. Despite the
fact that Saudi Arabia has the largest and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces
in the Arab region, ecommerce activities are not progressing at the same speed.
Only a tiny number of Saudi commercial organizations, mostly medium and large
companies from the manufacturing sector, are involved in e-commerce
implementation. Based on qualitative data, collected by conducting interviews
with a sample population of retail sector decision makers in Saudi Arabia, both
positive and negative issues influencing retailer adoption of electronic
retailing systems in Saudi Arabia are identified. A number of impediments which
include cultural, business and technical issues were reported. Facilitating
factors include access to educational programs and awareness building of
e-commerce, government support and assistance for ecommerce, trustworthy and
secure online payment options, developing strong ICT infrastructure, and
provision of sample e-commerce software to trial. While literature reveals that
government promotion has had limited effects on the diffusion of e-commerce in
most countries, this study significantly indicates government promotion and
support as a key driver to online retailing in KSA."
"This paper contributes to the issue of eGovernment implementation in Saudi
Arabia by discussing the current situation of ministry websites. It evaluates
the rate of web development progress of vital government websites in Saudi
Arabia using the eGovernment stage model. In 2010, Saudi Arabia ranked 58th in
the world and 4th in the Gulf region in eGovernment readiness according to
United Nations reports. In particular, Saudi Arabia has ranked 75th worldwide
for its online service index and its components compared to the neighbouring
Gulf country of Bahrain, which was ranked 8th for the same index. While this is
still modest in relation to the Saudi government expectation concerning its
vision for eGovernment implementation for 2010, and the results achieved by the
neighbouring Gulf countries such as Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates on the
eGovernment index, the Saudi government has endeavoured to meet the public
needs concerning eGovernment and carry out the implementation of eGovernment
properly. Governments may heed the importance of actively launching official
government websites as the main portals for delivering their online services to
all the different categories of eGovernment (including G2C, G2B, and G2G).
However, certain Saudi ministries have not given due attention to this vital
issue. This is evidenced by the fact that some of their websites are not fully
developed or do not yet exist, which clearly impedes that particular ministry
from appropriately delivering eServices."
"This paper presents the preliminary findings of a study researching the
diffusion and the adoption of online retailing in Saudi Arabia. It reports new
research that identifies and explores the key issues that positively and
negatively influence the decision of Saudi customers to buy from online
retailers in Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi Arabia has the largest and fastest
growth of ICT marketplaces in the Arab region, e-commerce activities are not
progressing at the same speed. While the overall research project involves
exploratory research using mixed methods, the focus of this paper is on a
quantitative analysis of responses obtained from a survey of Saudi customers,
with the design of the questionnaire instrument being based on the findings of
a qualitative analysis reported in a previous paper. The main findings of the
current analysis include a list of key factors that affect Saudi customers'
purchase from Saudi online retailers, and quantitative indications of the
relative strengths of the various relationships."
"In today global age, e-government services have become the main channel for
online communication between the government and its citizens. They aim to
provide citizens with more accessible, accurate, real-time and high quality
services. Therefore, the quality of government websites which provide
e-services is an essential factor in the successful adoption of e-government
services by the public. This paper discusses an investigation of the effect of
the Website Quality (WQ) factor on the acceptance of using e-government
services (G2C) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) by adopting the Unified
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) Model. Survey Data collected
from 400 respondents were examined using the structural equation modelling
(SEM) technique and utilising AMOS tools. This study found that the factors
that significantly influenced the Use Behaviour of e-government services in KSA
(USE) include Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort expectancy (EE), Facilitating
Conditions (FC) and Website Quality (WQ), while the construct known Social
Influence (SI) did not. Moreover, the results confirm the importance of quality
government websites and support systems as one of the main significant and
influential factors of e-government services adoption. The results of this
study can be helpful to Saudi governmental sectors to adjust their corporate
strategies and plans to advance successful adoption and diffusion of
e-government services (G2C) in KSA."
"Commercial cities like Colombo constantly face to problem of traffic
congestion due to the large number of people visiting the city for various
reasons. Also these cities have a large number of roads with many roads
connecting any two selected locations. Finding the best path between two
locations in Colombo city is not a trivial task, due to the complexity of the
road network and other reasons such as heavy traffic, changes to the road
networks such as road closures and one-ways. This paper presents the results of
a study carried out to understand this problem and development of a system to
plan the travel way ahead of the planned day or time of the journey. This
system can compute the best route from between two locations taking multiple
factors such as traffic conditions, road closures or one-way declarations etc.,
into account. This system also has the capability to compute the best route
between any two locations on a future date based on the road conditions on that
date. The system comprises three main modules and two user interfaces one for
normal users and the other for administrators. The Administrative interface can
only be accessed via web browser running on a computer, while the other
interface can be accessed either via a web browser or a GPRS enabled mobile
phone. The system is powered mainly by the Geographic Information System (GIS)
technology and the other supporting technologies used are database management
system, ASP.Net technology and the GPRS technology. Finally the developed
system was evaluated for its functionality and user friendliness using a user
survey. The results of the survey are also presented in this paper."
"Using a mathematical model, we show that a Triple Helix (TH) system contains
self-interaction, and therefore self-organization of innovations can be
expected in waves, whereas a Double Helix (DH) remains determined by its linear
constituents. (The mathematical model is fully elaborated in the Appendices.)
The ensuing innovation systems can be expected to have a fractal structure:
innovation systems at different scales can be considered as spanned in a
Cartesian space with the dimensions of (S)cience, (B)usiness, and (G)overnment.
A national system, for example, contains sectorial and regional systems, and is
a constituent part in technological and supra-national systems of innovation.
The mathematical modeling enables us to clarify the mechanisms, and provides
new possibilities for the prediction. Emerging technologies can be expected to
be more diversified and their life cycles will become shorter than before. In
terms of policy implications, the model suggests a shift from the production of
material objects to the production of innovative technologies."
"This paper presents some findings from a study researching the diffusion and
adoption of online retailing in Saudi Arabia. Although the country has the
largest and fastest growing ICT marketplace in the Arab region, e-commerce
activities have not progressed at a similar speed. In general, Saudi retailers
have not responded actively to the global growth of online retailing.
Accordingly new research has been conducted to identify and explore key issues
that positively and negatively influence Saudi retailers in deciding whether to
adopt the online channel. While the overall research project uses mixed
methods, the focus of this paper is on a quantitative analysis of responses
obtained from a survey of retailers in Saudi Arabia, with the design of the
questionnaire instrument being based on the findings of a qualitative analysis
reported in a previous paper. The main findings of the current analysis include
a list of key factors that affect retailers decision to adopt e-commerce, and
quantitative indications of the relative strengths of the various
relationships."
"Retailers in Saudi Arabia have been reserved in their adoption of
electronically delivered aspects of their business. This paper reports research
that identifies and explores key issues to enhance the diffusion of online
retailing in Saudi Arabia. Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has the largest
and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces in the Arab region, e-commerce
activities are not progressing at the same speed. Only very few Saudi
companies, mostly medium and large companies from the manufacturing sector, are
involved in e-commerce implementation. Based on qualitative data collected by
conducting interviews with 16 retailers and 16 potential customers in Saudi
Arabia, 7 key drivers to online retailing diffusion in Saudi Arabia are
identified. These key drivers are government support, providing trustworthy and
secure online payments options, provision of individual house mailboxes,
providing high speed Internet connection at low cost, providing educational
programs, the success of bricks-and-clicks model, and competitive prices."
"In order to keep a green planet, in particular its important to limiting the
pollution with gas emissions. In a specific capacitated fixed-charge
transportation problem with fixed capacities for distribution centers and
customers with particular demands, the objective is to keep the pollution
factor in a given range while the total cost of the transportation is as low as
possible. In order to solve this problem, we developed several hybrid variants
of the nearest neighbor classical approach. The proposed models are analyzed on
a set of instances used in the literature. The preliminary results shows that
the newly approaches are attractive and appropriate for solving the described
transportation problem."
"Mutual information in three (or more) dimensions can be considered as a
Triple-Helix indicator of synergy in university-industry-government relations.
An open-source routine th4.exe makes the computation of this indicator
interactively available at the Internet, and thus applicable to large sets of
data. Th4.exe computes all probabilistic entropies and mutual information in
two, three, and, if available in the data, four dimensions among, for example,
classes such as geographical addresses (cities, regions), technological codes
(e.g., OECD's NACE codes), and size categories; or, alternatively, among
institutional addresses (academic, industrial, public sector) in document sets.
The relations between the Triple-Helix indicator -- as an indicator of synergy
-- and the Triple-Helix model that specifies the possibility of feedback by an
overlay of communications, are also discussed."
"Digital technologies are constantly changing, and with it criminals are
finding new ways to abuse these technologies. Cybercrime investigators, then,
must also keep their skills and knowledge up to date. This work proposes a
holistic training development model - specifically focused on cybercrime
investigation - that is based on improving investigator capability while also
considering the capacity of the investigator or unit. Along with a training
development model, a cybercrime investigation capacity assessment framework is
given for attempting to measure capacity throughout the education process.
First, a training development model is proposed that focuses on the expansion
of investigation capability as well as capacity of investigators and units.
Next, a capacity assessment model is given to evaluate the effectiveness of the
training program. A description of how the proposed model is being applied to
the development of training programs for cybercrime investigators in developing
countries will then be given, as well as already observed challenges. Finally,
concluding remarks as well as proposed future work is discussed."
"Over the years, the Internet has democratized the flow of information.
Unfortunately, in parallel, authoritarian regimes and other entities (such as
ISPs) for their vested interests have curtailed this flow by partially or fully
censoring the web. The policy, mechanism, and extent of this censorship varies
from country to country.
  We present the first study of the cause, effect, and mechanism of web
censorship in Pakistan. Specifically, we use a publicly available list of
blocked websites and check their accessibility from multiple networks within
the country. Our results indicate that the censorship mechanism varies across
websites: some are blocked at the DNS level while others at the HTTP level.
Interestingly, the government shifted to a centralized, Internet exchange level
censorship system during the course of our study, enabling our findings to
compare two generations of blocking systems. Furthermore, we report the outcome
of a controlled survey to ascertain the mechanisms that are being actively
employed by people to circumvent censorship. Finally, we discuss some simple
but surprisingly unexplored methods of bypassing restrictions."
"Technology adoption theories assume that users' acceptance of an innovative
technology is on a voluntary basis. However, sometimes users are force to
accept an innovation. In this case users have to learn what it is useful for
and how to use it. This learning process will enable users to transit from zero
knowledge about the innovation to making the best use of it. So far the effects
of user learning on technology adoption have received little research
attention. In this paper - for the first time - we investigate the effects of
user learning on forced innovation adoption by using an agent-based simulation
approach using the case of forced smart metering deployments in the city of
Leeds"
"This paper presents a novel framework for ubiquitous social networks (USNs).
Instead of making virtual connections, on the basis of human social networks,
an effort has been made to facilitate interactions among human social networks
with the help of virtual social networks. The imperative domains that support
ubiquitous social networks are highlighted and different scenarios are provided
to project real world applications of proposed framework. Our proposed
framework can provide preliminary foundations for creating ubiquitous social
networks in true essence."
"Business expectations regarding the introduction of business information
systems were investigated according to company size categories. The results
clearly showed that according to the majority of the respondents the
information supply for decision-makers improved. In contrast, business
information systems as a means of improving competitiveness were only regarded
by corporations, this aspect was only around the average in the other company
size categories. The respondents evaluated to what extent the usage of business
information system provided assistance for their economic analyses. The
obtained results show that business information systems can be utilized well in
controlling and reporting. There are differences in their judgement by size
categories. Particularly corporations can take advantage of the support of
business information systems mainly in the field of planning, plan-actual
analysis and the exploration of cost reducing possibilities."
"Various models of the information society have been developed so far and they
are so different from country to country that it would be rather unwise to look
for a single, allencompassing definition. In our time a number of profound
socioeconomic changes are underway. The application of these theories and
schools on ICT is problematic in many respects. First, as we stated above,
there is not a single, widely used paradigm which has synthesised the various
schools and theories dealing with technology and society. Second, these
fragmented approaches do not have a fully fledged mode of application to the
relationship of ICT and (information) society. Third, SCOT, ANT, the
evolutionary or the systems approach to the history of technology when dealing
with information society does not take into account the results of approaches
studying the very essence of the information age: information, communication
and knowledge. The list of unnoticed or partially incorporated sciences, which
focuses on the role of ICT in human information processing and other cognitive
activities, is much longer."
"Based on a conceptual model, this paper aims to explore the background of the
decision-making process leading to the introduction of business information
systems among enterprises in Hungary. Together with presenting the problems
arising in the course of the implementation of such systems, their usage
patterns are also investigated. A strong correlation is established between the
size of an enterprise, the scope of its business activities and the range of
the business information systems it applies."
"A novel comparative research and analysis method is proposed and applied on
the Hungarian economic sectors. The question of what factors have an effect on
their net income is essential for enterprises. First, the potential indicators
related to economic sectors were studied and then compared to the net income of
the surveyed enterprises. The data resulting from the comparison showed that
the growing penetration of electronic marketpalces contributed to the change of
the net income of enterprises in various economic sectors to the extent of 37%.
Among all the potential indicators, only the indicator of electronic
marketplaces has a direct influence on the net income of enterprises. Two
clusters based on the potential indicators were indicated."
"The IT functions of the companies can be executed in different ways inhouse
solution, outsourcing, in sourcing, formation a spinoff company. Predominantly
this function is provided within the company in Hungary. The larger a company
is; it is more likely that a separate IT manager will be entrusted for the
supervision of IT functions. Only a very small number of smallsized enterprises
said that they paid special attention to formulating an IT strategy, while it
was not considered important by microenterprises at all."
"After years of speculation, price discrimination in e-commerce driven by the
personal information that users leave (involuntarily) online, has started
attracting the attention of privacy researchers, regulators, and the press. In
our previous work we demonstrated instances of products whose prices varied
online depending on the location and the characteristics of perspective online
buyers. In an effort to scale up our study we have turned to crowd-sourcing.
Using a browser extension we have collected the prices obtained by an initial
set of 340 test users as they surf the web for products of their interest. This
initial dataset has permitted us to identify a set of online stores where price
variation is more pronounced. We have focused on this subset, and performed a
systematic crawl of their products and logged the prices obtained from
different vantage points and browser configurations. By analyzing this dataset
we see that there exist several retailers that return prices for the same
product that vary by 10%-30% whereas there also exist isolated cases that may
vary up to a multiplicative factor, e.g., x2. To the best of our efforts we
could not attribute the observed price gaps to currency, shipping, or taxation
differences."
"In today's instant communication era, mobile phones play an important role in
the efficient communication with respect to both individual and official
communication strata. With the drastic explosion in the quantity of calls
received and made, there is a need for analyses of patterns in these call logs
to assist the user of the mobile device in the optimal utilization. This paper
proposes a model termed ""LogMin"" (Log Mining of Calls in Mobile devices) which
is aimed towards mining of call log in mobile phones to discover patterns and
keep the user informed about the trends in the log. The logging of calls would
facilitate the user to get an insight into patterns based on the six different
parameters identified by the proposed LogMin model. The proposed model is
validated with a prototype implementation in the Android platform and various
experiments were conducted on it. The results of the experiments in the LogMin
Android implementation validate the efficiency of the proposed model with
respect to user's relevancy metric which is computed as 96.52%."
"In recent years the game industry has had a huge growth. We've seen new game
consoles, great looking games and an increase in the number of people playing
them. We are presently in the seventh generation of video games which focuses
on consoles released since 2004. For home consoles,the seventh generation began
on November 22, 2005 with the release of Xbox 360 and continued with the
release of PlayStation 3 on November 11, 2006, and Wii on November 19, 2006.
The current generation is having a console battle between Nintendo's Wii,
Microsoft's Xbox 360, and Sony's PlayStation 3.The appearance of the three new
consoles not only offers various purchase choices, but also greatly affects
economy and culture."
"The main purpose of this research is to determine the influence of culture on
e-government (electronic government) acceptance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(KSA). Citizens' transactional interactions (electronic transactions or
e-transactions) with the government via the Internet are examined. Multiple
models and theories in extant literature were referred to in identifying the
research context requirements that enabled the analysis of e-transaction
acceptance. A new research model that fits the research context was developed
to predict and explain how acceptance is affected. A sample of 671 Saudi
citizens was recruited using an online survey. Structural equation modelling
was used to assess the impact on intention to use e-transactions. Preference
for using e-transactions as a communication method, perceptions of the
compatibility of e-transactions with values and citizens' needs,
communicability of the results of using e-transactions, trust in the Internet
as a medium of communication with the government, and conservation values are
positive significant determinants of e-transaction acceptance. Conversely, the
influence of trust in government agencies and motivation towards gaining
prestige and possessing dominance over people and resources was negative. The
findings of this study include design and implementation strategies that can
serve as guidance for the Saudi government, as well as for the developers and
implementers of e-transactions in the KSA."
"Education is the main infrastructure for promoting a nation and increasing
their competitiveness in globalization era that involves the use of information
technology (IT). This paper has goal to expand the alternative for learning
strategy based on IT for final year students that will conduct a research for
their final report. The final year students are expected have the ability to
learn independently to manage the needness of their learning supply. In this
paper, the author will discuss how to use the e-learning media and blogs to
manage the independently learning environment or self-learning. E-learning
offers the flexibilities in term of time and place in supporting the learning
activities as well as a media for faculty/lecturer to disseminate learning
materials. While the blog has been a free medium for the publication of variety
contents, including academic contents. In this paper, author suggests some the
institutions regulations, lecturers roles, and students participations are
involve in set the learning environment based on e-learning and blog. These
activities able to support students in learning independently or self-learning."
"In current era, the involvement of technologies like virtualization,
consolidation and cloud computing, and adoption of free and open source
software in designing and deploying e-governance that can reduce the total cost
associated with and hence the financial burden abide by the state and central
governments. The success of any e-governance project depends upon its
utilization by the intended group and so there accessibility needs to be
enhanced drastically by reengineered framework. Here, we design an Improved
Service Delivery and Cost Effective Framework for e-Governance that will be
useful for success of e-governance projects and the delivery mechanism in India
by using free and open access software for development and deployment of
e-governance applications, virtualization and consolidation techniques for
management of e-services and cloud computing for enhancing the accessibility of
services."
"University teachers often feel the need to try innovative learning
technologies such as Learning Games to motivate the new generation of students.
However, the typically limited resources of universities coupled with the high
cost of designing and developing Learning Games result in it rarely being
feasible to meet this need. To address this challenging problem, we have
designed a framework that allows teachers to create their own Learning Games
with very little or no help from developers and graphic designers. This
framework, tested and validated by several university teachers, is suited to a
wide variety of educational fields because it generates Learning Games based on
the widely-used case teaching method."
"In this world of terrorism, it is very important to know the network of
individual suspects. It is also important to analyze the attributes of members
of a network and the relationships that exist between them either directly or
indirectly. This will make it easy for concepts to be built in aiding criminal
investigations. However traditional approaches cannot be used to visualize and
analyze data collected on individuals. With this current day where information
systems play critical role in everyday life of every individual, it is easier
to depend on digital information in fighting crime.Effective computer tools and
intelligent systems that are automated to analyze and interpret criminal data
in real time effectively and efficiently are needed in fighting crime. These
current computer systems should have the capability of providing intelligence
from raw data and creating a visual graph which will make it easy for new
concepts to be built and generated from crime data in order to solve understand
and analyze crime patterns easily. This paper proposes a new method of computer
aided investigation by visualizing and analyzing data of mobile communication
devices using Formal Concept Analysis, or Galois Lattices, a data analysis
technique grounded on Lattice Theory and Propositional Calculus. This method
considered the set of common and distinct attributes of data in such a way that
categorizations are done based on related data with respect to time and events.
This will help in building a more defined and conceptual systems for analysis
of crime data that can easily be visualized and intelligently analyzed by
computer systems."
"The rapid spread of mobile phones means that the number of mobile users may
already exceed the number of banked people in many low income countries. Mobile
phones can also offer a communications channel for initiating and executing
on-line financial transactions. This channel may not only reduce the cost of
financial transactions for provider and customer, but also allow new entrants
to the financial sector, and new relationships to be formed for distributing
services. These changes hold the prospect of accelerating access to financial
services on the back of the mobile infrastructure. Mobile telephony offers
tremendous promise to facilitate the flow of money among rural and poor
families at much lower transaction costs, bringing the bank to those currently
unbanked. Realizing this promise will require close collaboration among all
stakeholders. But most rural banks do not have mobile banking services for
their customers. This made it difficult for the full potential and benefits of
mobile money financial services to be realized. Most telecommunication service
providers run mobile money service solely for their subscribers without an
integrated approach of incorporating and integrating rural banking systems into
their existing services this makes it difficult for a full fledge exploitation
of the mobile financial market. This paper looks at the existing mobile money
services and takes critical look at the positive advantages of effective
integration approach of Rural Banks and existing mobile communications
infrastructure as well as proposing a model for such integration."
"In the present day, the requirement of securing electronic cash flow system
are increasing significantly. Todays life is so busy that spending a valuable
second cost so much. In, such situation if money flow is possible swiftly by
just one swipe it would be a great relief. Biometric based authentication can
be a new approach to satisfy user needs by replacing password-based
authentication. Among all biometric techniques fingerprinting is the oldest and
secured methodology practised till date. In the proposed system user can
transact money by placing his/her thumb imprint on new proposed ATM card. This
new system will smoothen the transaction with security."
"There are challenges faced in today's world in terms of crime analysis when
it comes to graphical visualization of crime patterns. Geographical
representation of crime scenes and crime types become very important in
gathering intelligence about crimes. This provides a very dynamic and easy way
of monitoring criminal activities and analyzing them as well as producing
effective countermeasures and preventive measures in solving them. But we need
effective computer tools and intelligent systems that are automated to analyze
and interpret criminal data in real time effectively and efficiently. These
current computer systems should have the capability of providing intelligence
from raw data and creating a visual graph which will make it easy for new
concepts to be built and generated from crime data in order to solve,

of visualizing and analyzing crime patterns based on geographical crime data by
using Formal Concept Analysis, or Galois Lattices, a data analysis technique
grounded on Lattice Theory and Propositional Calculus. This method considered
the set of common and distinct attributes of crimes in such a way that
categorization are done based on related crime types. This will help in
building a more defined and conceptual systems for analysis of geographical

"The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are
accommodating half of the world's population thereby creating tremendous
pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large
concentration of resources and facilities. Such environments attract people
from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now become an
overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure
towards efficient city management has triggered various Smart City initiatives
by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to find
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has
also gained significant attention over the past decade. IoT envisions to
connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for
efficient and effective resource management in Smart Cities. Today
infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a
service and how it fits with the Internet of Things. Our objective is to
investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological,
economical, and social perspectives and identify the major open challenges and
issues."
"The performance of employees in an organization is a very important issue for
effective delivery and output. Various performance management systems with the
aid of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are currently being used
by companies. Such systems are most of the time connected and accessible
through to the internet / www. Through review of relevant literature and a
system development methodology, this paper proposes an Automated Intelligent
Decision Support Human Resource (AIDSS-HR) system that seeks to control and
manage employee activities by tracking the number of years a staff has been at
post, keeping inventory on logistics, analyzing appraisal reports of an
individual staff and invoking real time prompts devoid of false alarm. The
implementation of AIDSS-HR will improve the performance management of employees
and benefit the organization, employees and developing nations as a whole."
"Educating the users on the essential of information security is very vital
and important to the mission of establishing a sustainable information security
in any organization and institute. At the University Technology Malaysia (UTM),
we have recognized the fact that, it is about time information security should
no longer be a lacking factor in productivity, both information security and
productivity must work together in closed proximity. We have recently
implemented a broad campus information security awareness program to educate
faculty member, staff, students and non-academic staff on this essential topic
of information security. The program consists of training based on web,
personal or individual training with a specific monthly topic, campus
campaigns, guest speakers and direct presentations to specialized groups. The
goal and the objective are to educate the users on the challenges that are
specific to information security and to create total awareness that will change
the perceptions of people thinking and ultimately their reactions when it comes
to information security. In this paper, we explain how we created and
implemented our information security awareness training (ISAT) program and
discuss the impediment we encountered along the process. We explore different
methods of deliveries such as target audiences, and probably the contents as we
believe might be vital to a successful information security program. Finally,
we discuss the importance and the flexibility of establishing a sustainable
information security training program that could be adopted to meet current and
future needs and demands while still relevant to our current users."
"Information sharing in organization has been considered as an important
approach in increasing organizational efficiency, performance and decision
making. With the present and advances in information and communication
technology, sharing information and exchanging of data across organizations has
become more feasible in organization. However, information sharing has been a
complex task over the years and identifying factors that influence information
sharing across organization has becomes crucial and critical. Researchers have
taken several methods and approaches to resolve problems in information sharing
at all levels without a lasting solution, as sharing is best understood as a
practice that reflects behavior, social, economic, legal and technological
influences. Due to the limitation of the conventional ISM3 standards to address
culture, social, legislation and human behavior, the findings in this paper
suggest that, a centralized information structure without human practice,
distribution of information and coordination is not effective. This paper
reviews the previous information sharing research, outlines the factors
affecting information sharing and the different practices needed to improve the
management of information security by recommending several combinations of
information security and coordination mechanism for reducing uncertainty during
sharing of information .This thesis proposes information security management
protocol (ISMP) as an enhancement towards ISM3 to resolve the above problems.
This protocol provides a means for practitioners to identify key factors
involved in successful information sharing....."
"Les capitalistes sociaux sont des utilisateurs de m\'edias sociaux tels que
Twitter, appliquant diverses techniques pour obtenir un maximum de
visibilit\'e. Ils peuvent \^etre n\'efastes \`a l'\'equilibre du service, dans

various methods to maximize their visibility. This results in artificially
important accounts, in the sense this importance is not backed by any real
content. The risk is then to see those accounts hiding relevant contents and
therefore preventing other users to access them. In this work, we want to
characterize social capitalists from a purely topological perspective, i.e.
without considering the nature of the shared contents. For this purpose, we use
the notion of community role, based on the community structure of the studied
network. We modify some measures previously designed for this matter, and
propose an objective method to determine roles. We then apply this method to
the analysis of a Twitter network. Our results show the roles identified
through our measures are particularly consistent with Twitter's social
capitalists, whose behavior was clearly identified."
"The notion of patient's consent plays a major role in granting access to
medical data. In typical healthcare systems, consent is captured by a form that
the patient has to fill in and sign. In e-Health systems, the paper-form
consent is being replaced by the integration of the notion of consent in the
mechanisms that regulate the access to the medical data. This helps in
empowering the patient with the capability of granting and revoking consent in
a more effective manner. However, the process of granting and revoking consent
greatly varies according to the situation in which the patient is. Our main
argument is that such a level of detail is very difficult and error-prone to
capture as a set of authorisation policies. In this paper, we present ACTORS, a
goal-driven approach to manage consent. The main idea behind ACTORS is to
leverage the goal-driven approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming for
managing consent that takes into account changes regarding the domains and
contexts in which the patient is providing her consent."
"The ongoing process of liberalization, as well as the intensive technological
breakthrough have a great impact either on the macroeconomic policy creators,
or the dissimilarity of conventional approach to found a strategy of a certain
company. Bearing in mind the very notation, core characteristics of the concept
of competitiveness are needed to be explored, but also the necessity to
establish a national competitiveness strategy. However, the main attention
should be paid on the technological changes that affect the economic growth,
but the life standard increase, as well. Nevertheless, developing and
transitional economies are being down-sided with respect to the technological
and innovative capability that measurably implies the necessity to redefine the
conception of competitiveness. Taking into account the above clarifications,
the paper will set a comparative analysis of the key factors that pressure the
competitiveness of Balkans region countries, mainly by the composition of the
Growth Competitiveness Index. In addition, the major accent will be put on the
composite Technology index and its impact on the mainstream of the respective
total index. Finally, the paper will examine the possible change of Growth
Competitiveness Index ranking of the Macedonian economy, principally by the
variation of the Technology index rank."
"Contemporary ways of doing business are heavily dependent on the
e-Commerce/e-Business paradigm. The highest priority of an e-Commerce Web
site's management is to assure pertinent Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels of
their Web services continually, in order to keep the potential e-Customers
satisfied. Otherwise, it faces an immense possibility of losing both
e-Customers and revenues, along with a big possibility of gaining bad
reputation due to either poor performance or unavailability of the e-Commerce
Web site. In order to avoid numerous unpleasant consequences, by designing and
implementing e-Commerce Web sites that will always meet e-Customer's high
expectations, a relevant performance models have to be utilized to obtain
appropriate performance metrics. A continuous assessment of current
performances and especially predicting future needs are the subjects of
capacity planning methodologies. Within this paper, such a predictive model has
been described and evaluated by using discrete-event simulation of both the
client-side and server-side processes involved. In addition, the paper
discusses the performance metrics obtained as a function of the intensity and
quality of the workload parameters."
"With an upsurge in financial accounting fraud in the current economic
scenario experienced, financial accounting fraud detection (FAFD) has become an
emerging topic of great importance for academic, research and industries. The
failure of internal auditing system of the organization in identifying the
accounting frauds has lead to use of specialized procedures to detect financial
accounting fraud, collective known as forensic accounting. Data mining
techniques are providing great aid in financial accounting fraud detection,
since dealing with the large data volumes and complexities of financial data
are big challenges for forensic accounting. This paper presents a comprehensive
review of the literature on the application of data mining techniques for the
detection of financial accounting fraud and proposes a framework for data
mining techniques based accounting fraud detection. The systematic and
comprehensive literature review of the data mining techniques applicable to
financial accounting fraud detection may provide a foundation to future
research in this field. The findings of this review show that data mining
techniques like logistic models, neural networks, Bayesian belief network, and
decision trees have been applied most extensively to provide primary solutions
to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent
data."
"Can we move beyond simply networking creative individuals to establishing
diverse communities of practice for innovation through discursive methods.
Furthermore, can we digitise their creativity activities within an integrative
socio-cultural collaborative technology platform that could then support
distributed innovation. First, we consider the complexity of creative cultures
from the perspective of design innovation, including how to nurture creativity
activities in what we call Creative Gardens. Specifically, how they could grow,
diverge, and combine, be- ing cultivated to nurture emergent, disruptive,
collaborative innovation. Then, we consider the digitisation of Creative
Gardens from the perspective of digital culture. Specifically, the tenets of
Creative Gardens as dynamic and innovative communities. This includes
considering the challenges and opportunities around digitisation, the
influences around the connectivity with knowledge cultivation, and the
potential for distributed innovation as collective intelligence to utilise
diverse expertise. We conclude be considering the importance of the issues and
questions raised, and their potential for the future."
"Being an emerging business practice, gamification is going to the mainstream
to enable and transform social business initiatives across enterprises. With
the consistent focus on customer behavior and experience, there is a paradigm
shift in thinking about how Gamification and Social initiatives together help
to increase the engagement level of knowledge worker, yielding better business
results. Business scenarios for gamification are wide spread ranging from
customer service and support to communities and collaboration.
  The Paper discusses the characteristics & mechanism to learn from games that
are important for businesses to understand and apply. It also gives insights on
gamification trends, real-world business challenges and also describes on how
game thinking can revolutionize the business and create an engaging experience."
"Fake websites have emerged as a major source of online fraud, accounting for
billions of dollars of loss by Internet users. We explore the process by which
salient design elements could increase the use of protective tools, thus
reducing the success rate of fake websites. Using the protection motivation
theory, we conceptualize a model to investigate how salient design elements of
detection tools could influence user perceptions of the tools, efficacy in
dealing with threats, and use of such tools. The research method was a
controlled lab experiment with a novel and extensive experimental design and
protocol. We found that trust in the detector is the pivotal coping mechanism
in dealing with security threats and is a major conduit for transforming
salient design elements into increased use. We also found that design elements
have profound and unexpected impacts on self-efficacy. The significant
theoretical and empirical implications of findings are discussed."
"Constructionism is a learning theory that states that we learn more when we
construct tangible objects. In the process of building and presenting our work,
we make concrete the abstract mental models we've formed, see where they
breakdown through the feedback we receive, and revise the models accordingly.
Computer programming has long been taught under a constructionist approach
using sensory-rich contexts like robots, media, and Logo-style environments.
Now, with affordable 3-D printers in the hands of consumers, we have a new
medium in which learners may realize their computational ideas. In this
demonstration, we share a mobile development environment named Madeup, which
empowers its users to navigate 3-D space using a Logo-like imperative and
functional language. Every stop in space becomes a vertex in a 3-D model. The
generated models may be exported or uploaded to a 3-D printing service."
"The student generation nowadays is considered as the Net Generation who grow
up in the age of Internet and mobile technology and prefer bringing
technological application into their life. The Learning Resource Center, an
academic information center, takes the initiative in developing a collaborative
network with the participation of students for delivering information of
natural disasters and climate adaptation to the people who live in the
vulnerable areas of Thua Thien Hue province. The network is aimed at helping
local people mitigating vulnerabilities and adapting to the globally climate
change for a better life."
"The concept of local self-governance is not new as it has its roots in
ancient time even before the era of Mauryan emperors. This paper depicts the
journey of local self-governance from antediluvian time to 21st century.
Further, in the current scenario Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
has emerged as a successful tool for dissemination of various e-governance
services and in this regard the Government of India has formulated NeGP with
adequate service delivery mechanism. With the inculcation of ICT, various
applications were designed by central as well as state governments which lead
towards strengthening of PRIs for rural reform. This paper also throws some
light on necessity of ICT in self-governance along with some case studies."
"Shame has clear biological roots and its precise form of expression affects
social cohesion and cultural characteristics. Here we explore the relative
importance between shame and guilt by using Google Translate to produce
translation for the words shame, guilt, pain, embarrassment and fear to the 64
languages covered. We also explore the meanings of these concepts among the
Yanomami, a horticulturist hunter-gatherer tribe in the Orinoquia. Results show
that societies previously described as 'guilt societies' have more words for
guilt than for shame, but the large majority, including the societies
previously described as 'shame societies', have more words for shame than for
guilt. Results are consistent with evolutionary models of shame which predict a
wide scatter in the relative importance between guilt and shame, suggesting
that cultural evolution of shame has continued the work of biological
evolution, and that neither provides a strong adaptive advantage to either
shame or guilt. We propose that the study of shame will improve our
understanding of the interaction between biological and cultural evolution in
the evolution of cognition and emotions."

"Triple-Helix arrangements of bi- and trilateral relations can be considered
as adaptive eco-systems. During the last decade, we have further developed a
Triple-Helix indicator of synergy as reduction of uncertainty in niches that
can be shaped among three or more distributions. Reduction of uncertainty can
be generated in correlations among distributions of relations, but this
(next-order) effect can be counterbalanced by uncertainty generated in the
relations. We first explain the indicator, and then review possible results
when this indicator is applied to (i) co-author networks of academic,
industrial, and governmental authors and (ii) synergies in the distributions of
firms over geographical addresses, technological classes, and industrial-size
classes for a number of nations. Co-variation is then considered as a measure
of relationship. The balance between globalizing and localizing dynamics can be
quantified. Too much synergy locally can also be considered as lock-in.
Tendencies are different for the globalizing knowledge dynamics versus locally
retaining wealth from knowledge in industrial innovations."
"At computer modeling of process of training it is usually supposed that all
elements of a training material are forgotten with an identical speed. But in
practice that knowledge which are included in educational activity of the pupil
are remembered much more strongly and forgotten more slowly then knowledge
which he doesn't use. For the purpose of more exact research of didactic
systems is offered the model of training, in which consider that in case
increasing the number of applications of this element of a learning material:
1) duration of its use by the pupil decreases; 2) the coefficient of forgetting
decreases. The computer model is considered, programs in the Pascal language
are submitted, results of modeling are given and analyzed. Keywords: didactics,
information and cybernetic approach, computer modeling of process of training."
"Elder people are becoming a predominant aspect of our societies. As such,
solutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. The approach
pursued so far to solve this problem used to increase the number of people
working in the health sector, e.g. doctors, nurses, etc. This increases the
costs, which is becoming a big burden for countries. In this paper we propose a
new concept in the health management of elder people, which we name as
""participant"". We propose the ""participant"" concept to encourage elder people
to participate in those group activities that they are able to. Their roles in
these activities are not passively requesting help, but actively participating
to some healthcare processes. Characteristics of the participant approach are
that medical resources are efficiently spared with this model, and the social
network of the elder people is kept. A ""virtual community"" for mutual
assistance is set up in this paper, and the simulations demonstrate that the
""participant"" model could fully utilize the community resources. Furthermore,
the psychological health of the elder people will be improved."
"With the increase of the populations, resources are becoming scarcer, and a
smarter way to make use of them becomes a vital necessity of our societies. On
the other hand, resource management is traditionally carried out through well
established organizations, policies, and regulations that are often considered
as impossible to restructure. Our position is that merely expanding the
traditional approaches might not be enough. Systems must be radically rethought
in order to achieve a truly effective and rational use of the available
resources. Classical concepts such as demand and supply need to be rethought as
well, as they operate artificial classifications that limit the true potential
of systems and organizations. In what follows we propose our vision to future,
""smarter"" systems able to overcome the limitations of the status quo. Such
systems require what Boulding called ""gestalts,"" namely concepts able to
""directing research towards the gaps which they reveal"". In this paper we
elaborate on this and show how such gestalts can pave the way towards novel
reformulations of traditional services able to reach a better and more sensible
management of the available resources and cope with their scarcity. Our vision
of a Service-oriented Community is also introduced. We believe that such
communities---in heterarchical coexistence with traditional systems---provide
the necessary diversity and innovation orientation to prevent societal lock-ins
such as the ones we are experiencing in assisting our elderly ones."
"Elder people are becoming a predominant aspect of our societies. As such,
solutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. This paper
proposes a service-oriented infrastructure approach to this problem. We propose
an open and integrated service infrastructure to orchestrate the available
resources (smart devices, professional carers, informal carers) to help elder
or disabled people. Main characteristic of our design is the explicitly support
of dynamically available service providers such as informal carers. By modeling
the service description as Semantic Web Services, the service request can
automatically be discovered, reasoned about and mapped onto the pool of
heterogeneous service providers. We expect our approach to be able to
efficiently utilize the available service resources, enrich the service
options, and best match the requirements of the requesters."
"Electronic government (e-government) has established as an effective
mechanism for increasing government productivity and efficiency and a key
enabler of citizen- centric services. However, e-government implementation is
surrounded by technological, governing and social issues, which have to be
considered and treated carefully in order to facilitate this change. This
research attempts to explore and investigate the key challenges that influence
e-government implementation and the factors influencing citizen adoption in
Vietnam. It develops a conceptual framework on the basis of existing
experiences drawn from administrative reforms. Survey data from public employee
will be used to test the proposed hypothesis and the model. Therefore, this
research has identified factors that determine if the citizen will adopt
E-government services and thereby aiding governments in accessing what is
required to increase adoption. We will also highlight several research,
practitioner and policy implications."
"The economics of an internet crime has newly developed into a field of
controlling black money. This economic approach not only provides estimated
technique of analyzing internet crimes but also gives details to analyzers of
system dependability and divergence. This paper will highlight on the subject
of online crime, which has formed its industry since. It all started from
amateur hackers who cracked websites and wrote malicious software in pursuit of
fun or achieving limited objectives to professional hacking. In the past days,
electronic fraud was main objective but now it has been changed into electronic
hacking. This study focuses the issue through an economic analysis of available
web forum to deals in malware and private information. The findings of this
survey research provide considerable in-depth sight into the functions of
malware economy spinning around computer impositions and compromise. In this
regard, the survey research paper may benefit particularly computer security
officials, the law enforcement agencies, and in general prospective anyone
involved in better understanding cybercrime from the offender standpoint."
"In this study, the effect of online cooperative learning homework practices
on academic success of students is searched. The experience group of the
research consists of 58 students from Anadolu University Education Faculty
Education of Computer and Instruction Technology Section. Students in A section
are taken to traditional method by neutral appointment; those in B section are
taken to online homework practice method. In each class consisting of 29
people, it's decided that 14 students prepare their homework individually; the
rest 15 students prepare their homework with cooperative as triple groups. It's
students' own choice to prepare their homework individually or cooperatively.
There has been a success scale at the end of the teaching period. According to
research results, there isn't statistically considerable difference between
students who attend traditional homework practices and online homework
practices. According to research results, there isn't statistically
considerable difference between students who attend individual homework
practices and cooperative homework practices. The academic success of the
students who attend online-based individual homework practices is higher than
traditional individual and online based cooperative learning homework
practices."
"Resilience is widely recognized as an important design goal though it is one
that seems to escape a general and consensual understanding. Often mixed up
with other system attributes; traditionally used with different meanings in as
many different disciplines; sought or applied through diverse approaches in
various application domains, resilience in fact is a multi-attribute property
that implies a number of constitutive abilities. To further complicate the
matter, resilience is not an absolute property but rather it is the result of
the match between a system, its current condition, and the environment it is
set to operate in. In this paper we discuss this problem and provide a
definition of resilience as a property measurable as a system-environment fit.
This brings to the foreground the dynamic nature of resilience as well as its
hard dependence on the context. A major problem becomes then that, being a
dynamic figure, resilience cannot be assessed in absolute terms. As a way to
partially overcome this obstacle, in this paper we provide a number of
indicators of the quality of resilience. Our focus here is that of collective
systems, namely those systems resulting from the union of multiple individual
parts, sub-systems, or organs. Through several examples of such systems we
observe how our indicators provide insight, at least in the cases at hand, on
design flaws potentially affecting the efficiency of the resilience strategies.
A number of conjectures are finally put forward to associate our indicators
with factors affecting the quality of resilience."
"Web 3.0 promises to have a significant effect in users and businesses. It
will change how people work and play, how companies use information to market
and sell their products, as well as operate their businesses. The basic shift
occurring in Web 3.0 is from information-centric to knowledge-centric patterns
of computing. Web 3.0 will enable people and machines to connect, evolve, share
and use knowledge on an unprecedented scale and in new ways that make our
experience of the Internet better. Additionally, semantic technologies have the
potential to drive significant improvements in capabilities and life cycle
economics through cost reductions, improved efficiencies, enhanced
effectiveness, and new functionalities that were not possible or economically
feasible before. In this paper we look to the semantic web and Web 3.0
technologies as enablers for the creation of value and appearance of new
business models. For that, we analyze the role and impact of Web 3.0 in
business and we identify nine potential business models, based in direct and
undirected revenue sources, which have emerged with the appearance of semantic
web technologies."
"The purpose of this study is threefold: first, to bring reference groups back
into the framework of spiral of silence (SOS) by proposing an extended
framework of dual opinion climate; second, to investigate the boundary
conditions of SOS; third, to identify the characteristics of SOS in terms of
spatial variation and temporal evolution. Modeling SOS with agent-based models,
the findings suggest (1) there is no guarantee of SOS with reference groups
being brought back; (2) Stable existence of SOS is contingent upon the
comparative strength of mass media over reference groups; (3) SOS is
size-dependent upon reference groups and the population; (4) the growth rate of
SOS decreases over time. Thus, this research presents an extension of the SOS
theory."
"Peer assessment is an efficient and effective learning assessment method that
has been used widely in diverse fields in higher education. Despite its many
benefits, a fundamental problem in peer assessment is that participants lack
the motivation to assess others' work faithfully and fairly. Non-consensus is a
common challenge that makes the reliability of peer assessment a primary
concern in practices. This research proposes a motivation model that uses
review deviation and radicalization to identify non-consensus in peer
assessment. The proposed model is implemented as a software module in a peer
code review system called EduPCR4. EduPCR4 is able to monitor this measure and
trigger teacher's arbitration when it detects possible non-consensus. An
empirical study conducted in a university-level C programming course showed
that the proposed model and its implementation helped to improve the peer
assessment practices in many aspects."
"In this paper, we outline some potential conflicts that platform owners and
software developers face in mobile application markets. Our arguments are based
on comments captured in specialized online discussion forums, in which
developers gather to share knowledge and experiences. The key findings indicate
conflicts of interests, including 1) intra-platform competition, 2)
discriminative promotion, 3) entry prevention, 4) restricted monetization, 5)
restricted knowledge sharing, 6) substitution, and 7) strategic technology
selection. Opportunistic platform owners may use their power to discriminate
between third-part software developers. However, there are also potential
strategic solutions that developers can apply; for example diversification
(multi-homing), syndication and brand building."
"The present proliferation of e-learning has been actively underway for the
last 10 years. Current research in Adaptive Testing System focuses on the
development of psychometric models with items selection strategies applicable
to adaptive testing processes. The key aspect of proposed Adaptive Testing
System is to develop an increasingly sophisticated latent trait model which can
assist users in developing and enhancing their skills. Computerized Adaptive
Test (CAT) System requires a lot of investment in time and effort to develop
analyze and administrate an adaptive test. In this paper a fuzzy logic based
Multi User Adaptive Test System (MUATS) is developed. Which is a Short
Messaging Service (SMS) based System, currently integrated with GSM network
based on the new psychometric model in education assessment. MUATS is not only
a platform independent Adaptive Test System but also it eases the evaluation
effort for adaptive test process. It further uses fuzzy logic to pick the most
appropriate question from the pool of database for a specific user to be asked
which makes the overall system an intelligent one."
"Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely discussed over the past few years in
technology point of view. However, the social aspects of IoT are seldom studied
to date. In this paper, we discuss the IoT in social point of view.
Specifically, we examine the strategies to increase the adoption of IoT in a
sustainable manner. Such discussion is essential in today's context where
adoption of IoT solutions by non-technical community is slow. Specially, large
number of IoT solutions making their way into the market every day. We propose
an trading-based value creation model based on sensing as a service paradigm in
order to fuel the adoption of IoT. We discuss the value creation and its impact
towards the society especially to households and their occupants. We also
present results of two different surveys we conducted in order to examine the
potential acceptance of the proposed model among the general public."
"Internet of things (IoT) constitutes one of the most important technology
that has the potential to affect deeply our way of life, after mobile phones
and Internet. The basic idea is that every objet that is around us will be part
of the network (Internet), interacting to reach a common goal. In another word,
the Internet of Things concept aims to link the physical world to the digital
one. Technology advances along with popular demand will foster the wide spread
deployement of IoT's services, it would radically transform our corporations,
communities, and personal spheres. In this survey, we aim to provide the reader
with a broad overview of the Internet of things concept, its building blocks,
its applications along with its challenges."
"This paper presents a development paradigm for Ethiopia, based on appropriate
services and innovative use of mobile communications technologies via
applications tailored for sectors like business, finance, healthcare,
governance, education and infotainment. The experience of other developing
countries like India and Kenya is cited so as to adapt those to the Ethiopian
context. Notable application areas in the aforementioned sectors have been
outlined. The ETC 'next generation network' is taken into consideration, with
an emphasis on mobile service offering by the Telco itself and/or third party
service providers. In addition, enabling technologies like mobile internet,
location-based systems, open interfaces to large telecom networks, specifically
service-oriented architecture (SOA), Parlay/JAIN and the like are discussed.
The paper points out possible endeavors by such stakeholders like: telecom
agencies and network operators; businesses, government and NGOs; entrepreneurs
and innovators; technology companies and professionals; as well as researchers
and academic institutions. ICT4D through mobile services and their role in
bridging the digital divide by building a virtual 'network economy' is
presented."
"Transit fare arbitrage is the scenario when two or more commuters agree to
swap tickets during travel in such a way that total cost is lower than
otherwise. Such arbitrage allows pricing inefficiencies to be explored and
exploited, leading to improved pricing models. In this paper we discuss the
basics of fare arbitrage through an intuitive pricing framework involving
population density. We then analyze the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) system to understand underlying inefficiencies. We also provide source
code and comprehensive list of pairs of trips with significant arbitrage gain
at github.com/asifhaque/transit-arbitrage. Finally, we point towards a uniform
payment interface for different kinds of transit systems."
"Many complex human and natural phenomena can usefully be represented as
networks describing the relationships between individuals. While these
relationships are typically intermittent, previous research has used network
representations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals.
However, such an aggregation discards important temporal information, thus
inhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution.
We have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology
thus retaining the temporal properties of this network. Here we show how this
temporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We
show that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free,
leading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals.
While previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in
scale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free
connectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition,
we show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of
non-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for
sustaining time-expiring information through a network."
"Spreadsheets have been with us in their present form for over a quarter of a
century. We have become so used to them that we forget that we are using them
at all. It may serve us well to stand back for a moment to review where, when
and how we use spreadsheets in the financial markets and elsewhere in order to
inform research that may guide their future development. In this article I
bring together the experiences of a number of senior practitioners who have
spent much of their careers working with large spreadsheets that have been and
continue to be used to support major financial transactions and manage large
institutions in the City of London. The author suggests that the City of London
is presently exposed to significant reputational risk through the continued
uncontrolled use of critical spreadsheets in the financial markets and
elsewhere."
"In this work we present a measurement study of user mobility in Second Life.
We first discuss different techniques to collect user traces and then focus on
results obtained using a crawler that we built. Tempted by the question whether
our methodology could provide similar results to those obtained in real-world
experiments, we study the statistical distribution of user contacts and show
that from a qualitative point of view user mobility in Second Life presents
similar traits to those of real humans. We further push our analysis to line of
sight networks that emerge from user interaction and show that they are highly
clustered. Lastly, we focus on the spatial properties of user movements and
observe that users in Second Life revolve around several point of interests
traveling in general short distances. Besides our findings, the traces
collected in this work can be very useful for trace-driven simulations of
communication schemes in delay tolerant networks and their performance
evaluation."
"We present a prototype system that can be used to capture longitudinal
socialising processes by recording people's encounters in space. We argue that
such a system can usefully be deployed in prisons and other detention
facilities in order help intelligence analysts assess the behaviour or
terrorist and organised crime groups, and their potential relationships. Here
we present the results of a longitudinal study, carried out with civilians,
which demonstrates the capabilities of our system."
"Observing electronic voting from an international point of view gives some
perspective about its genesis and evolution. An analysis of the voting process
through its cultural, ontological, legal and political dimensions explains the
difficulty to normalize this process. It appears that international
organizations are not capable to properly defend the fundamental rights of the
citizens. The approach that was taken when DRE voting computers appeared seems
to have reoccured with VVAT voting computers and the european e-poll project."
"Automated collection of environmental data may be accomplished with wireless
sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, a general discussion of WSNs is given
for the gathering of data for educational research. WSNs have the capability to
enhance the scope of a researcher to include multiple streams of data:
environmental, location, cyberdata, video, and RFID. The location of data
stored in a database can allow reconstruction of the learning activity for the
evaluation of significance at a later time. A brief overview of the technology
forms the basis of an exploration of a setting used for outdoor learning."
"We performed a massive study of the dynamics of group deliberation among
several websites containing millions of opinions on topics ranging from books
to media. Contrary to the common phenomenon of group polarization observed
offline, we measured a strong tendency towards moderate views in the course of
time. This phenomenon possibly operates through a self-selection bias whereby
previous comments and ratings elicit contrarian views that soften the previous
opinions."
"The growing popularity of online social networks has provided researchers
with access to large amount of social network data. This, coupled with the ever
increasing computation speed, storage capacity and data mining capabilities,
led to the renewal of interest in automatic community detection methods.
Surprisingly, there is no universally accepted definition of the community. One
frequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or
better-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut
edges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008].
This definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community
detection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher
than expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative
definition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have
more influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We
present a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based
modularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into
communities. We evaluated our approach on the standard data sets used in
literature, and found that it often outperforms the edge-based modularity
algorithm."
"Industry cluster and supply chain are in focus of every countries which rely
on knowledge-based economy. Both focus on improving the competitiveness of firm
in the industry in the different aspect. This paper tries to illustrate how the
industry cluster can increase the supply chain performance. Then, the proposed
methodology concentrates on the collaboration and knowledge exchange in supply
chain. For improving the capability of the proposed methodology, information
technology is applied to facilitate the communication and the exchange of
knowledge between the actors of the supply chain within the cluster. The supply
chain of French stool producer was used as a case study to validate the
methodology and to demonstrate the result of the study."
"An important problem in creating efficient public transport is obtaining data
about the set of trips that passengers make, usually referred to as an
Origin/Destination (OD) matrix. Obtaining this data is problematic and
expensive in general, especially in the case of buses because on-board
ticketing systems do not record where and when passengers get off a bus. In
this paper we describe a novel and inexpensive system that uses off-the-shelf
Bluetooth hardware to accurately record passenger journeys. Here we show how
our system can be used to derive passenger OD matrices, and additionally we
show how our data can be used to further improve public transport services."
"Objectives - The authors' aim was to investigate the representations, wishes,
and fears of family caregivers (FCs) regarding 14 innovative technologies (IT)
for care aiding and burden alleviation, given the severe physical and
psychological stress induced by dementia care, and the very slow uptake of
these technologies in our society. Methods - A cluster sample survey based on a
self-administered questionnaire was carried out on data collected from 270
families of patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, located in
the greater Paris area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition
to usual statistical tests to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the
appreciation or rejection of the considered technologies. Results - Two
opposite clusters were clearly defined: FCs in favor of a substantial use of
technology, and those rather or totally hostile. Furthermore the distributions
of almost all the answers of appreciations were U shaped. Significant relations
were demonstrated between IT appreciation and FC's family or gender statuses
(e.g., female FCs appreciated more than male FCs a tracking device for quick
recovering of wandering patients: p=0.0025, N=195). Conclusions - The study
provides further evidence of the contrasted perception of technology in
dementia care at home, and suggests the development of public debates based on
rigorous assessment of practices and a strict ethical aim to protect against
misuse."
"The Web 2.0 fosters the creation of communities by offering users a wide
array of social software tools. While the success of these tools is based on
their ability to support different interaction patterns among users by imposing
as few limitations as possible, the communities they support are not free of
rules (just think about the posting rules in a community forum or the editing
rules in a thematic wiki). In this paper we propose a framework for the sharing
of best community practices in the form of a (potentially rule-based)
annotation layer that can be integrated with existing Web 2.0 community tools
(with specific focus on wikis). This solution is characterized by minimal
intrusiveness and plays nicely within the open spirit of the Web 2.0 by
providing users with behavioral hints rather than by enforcing the strict
adherence to a set of rules."
"Heterogeneous networks play a key role in the evolution of communities and
the decisions individuals make. These networks link different types of
entities, for example, people and the events they attend. Network analysis
algorithms usually project such networks unto simple graphs composed of
entities of a single type. In the process, they conflate relations between
entities of different types and loose important structural information. We
develop a mathematical framework that can be used to compactly represent and
analyze heterogeneous networks that combine multiple entity and link types. We
generalize Bonacich centrality, which measures connectivity between nodes by
the number of paths between them, to heterogeneous networks and use this
measure to study network structure. Specifically, we extend the popular
modularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality
metric. We also rank nodes based on their connectivity to other nodes. One
advantage of this centrality metric is that it has a tunable parameter we can
use to set the length scale of interactions. By studying how rankings change
with this parameter allows us to identify important nodes in the network. We
apply the proposed method to analyze the structure of several heterogeneous
networks. We show that exploiting additional sources of evidence corresponding
to links between, as well as among, different entity types yields new insights
into network structure."
"This article presents the results of a study which concerns Instrumented
Collective Learning Situations (ICLS) used in higher education and according to
different actors's point of view (instructional designer and tutor). Considered
actors have been involved in ICLS conception or in their use with students. We
determine several forms of ICLS (in terms of scenario, tools, kind of activity)
and what educational approaches are adopted by educational actors in their
practices. We detail the results of our study, mainly by highlighting the
""home-made"" approach of the actors, that is based on an opportunist and
pragmatic use of available tools in order to fit into the educational contexts."
"Very old people accumulate the ""handicaps"": social, physical, psychological
or cognitive. Various research thus developed to determine there waiting and
needs and also to see the benefit possibly produced by technologies (called
?gerontechnology?) on their living conditions. The object of this article is to
present the numerical service offer to very old perople and to see how it takes
part in a social justice according to the definition of Rawls (principle of
equal freedom, principle of equal opportunity in the access). The adoption, the
use and the benefit of technology are analyzed in a theoretical way through a
state of the art and in an experimental way through a qualitative and
quantitative investigation carried out with a population of very old people. We
propose to identify dynamic technological acceptance of old people according to
the TAM'S (Technology Acceptance Model) of Davis adapted by (Hamner and Qazi,
2008)."
"This article presents results of the observation of a project management
teaching-by-project course. It describe return of experience not only of
student but also of tutors one years after the course. Many problems are
identified like individual student evaluation, tutor distance, lake of
coordination, lake of communication. We ask tutor about the pertinence of an
instrumental solution, based upon dashboard, to solve problems of coordination
and evaluation identified. We made the hypothese that a cognitive tool will
improve too the knowledge construction and the learning process."
"The rights and duties of both staff members and students are regulated by a
large and different numbers of legal regulations and rules. This large number
of rules and regulations makes the decision-making process time consuming and
error boring. Smart advisory systems could provide rapid and accurate advices
to managers and give the arguments for these advices. This paper presents an
intelligent advisory system in law to assist the legal educational processes in
universities and institutes. The aims of the system are: to provide smart legal
advisors in the universities and institutes, to integrate rules and regulations
of universities and institutes in the e-government, to ease the burden on the
legal advisor and the provision of consulting services to users, to achieve
accurate and timely presentation of the legal opinion to a given problem and to
assure flexibility for accepting changes in the rules and legal regulations.
The system is based on experienced jurists and the rules and regulations of the
law organizing Saudi Arabia universities and institutes."
"This article analyses three methods of remote voting in an uncontrolled
environment: postal voting, internet voting and hybrid voting. It breaks down
the voting process into different stages and compares their vulnerabilities
considering criteria that must be respected in any democratic vote:
confidentiality, anonymity, transparency, vote unicity and authenticity.
Whether for safety or reliability, each vulnerability is quantified by three
parameters: size, visibility and difficulty to achieve. The study concludes
that the automatisation of treatments combined with the dematerialisation of
the objects used during an election tends to substitute visible vulnerabilities
of a lesser magnitude by invisible and widespread vulnerabilities."
"e-Research is a rapidly growing research area, both in terms of publications
and in terms of funding. In this article we argue that it is necessary to
reconceptualize the ways in which we seek to measure and understand e-Research
by developing a sociology of knowledge based on our understanding of how
science has been transformed historically and shifted into online forms. Next,
we report data which allows the examination of e-Research through a variety of
traces in order to begin to understand how the knowledge in the realm of
e-Research has been and is being constructed. These data indicate that
e-Research has had a variable impact in different fields of research. We argue
that only an overall account of the scale and scope of e-Research within and
between different fields makes it possible to identify the organizational
coherence and diffuseness of e-Research in terms of its socio-technical
networks, and thus to identify the contributions of e-Research to various
research fronts in the online production of knowledge."
"Formalist positions towards money are considered from a perspective of formal
methods in computing. The Formaleuro (FEUR) as a dimension for monetary
quantities is proposed as well as the Formalbitcoin (FBTC) which represents an
item ready for circulation in a model of informational money.
  An attempt is made to understand the concept of money from scratch. In order
to provide a definition of money the need is felt to make use of a tailored
theory of definition. To that end a theory of imaginative definitions is
presented and its implications for definitions of money are sketched.
  It is argued that a theory of money may be dependent on the role of its
holder. A survey of some roles is given, with the so-called subordinate
administrative role (SAR) in a central position.
  The concepts of virtual memory and virtual machine are taken as the point of
departure for a definition of the notion of virtual money. It is argued that
from the perspective of a component (division) of a large organization (ORG)
its local financial system (LFS) provides a virtual money vm(LFS, ORG) which
may well fail to meet the most common general and acknowledged moneyness
criteria. Inverse moneyness preference is coined as phrase to assert the
tendency of top-management of ORG to make its virtual money deviate from these
criteria."
"Much of economic theory is built on observations of aggregate, rather than
individual, behavior. Here, we present novel findings on human shopping
patterns at the resolution of a single purchase. Our results suggest that much
of our seemingly elective activity is actually driven by simple routines. While
the interleaving of shopping events creates randomness at the small scale, on
the whole consumer behavior is largely predictable. We also examine
income-dependent differences in how people shop, and find that wealthy
individuals are more likely to bundle shopping trips. These results validate
previous work on mobility from cell phone data, while describing the
unpredictability of behavior at higher resolution."
"It is now commonplace to see the Web as a platform that can harness the
collective abilities of large numbers of people to accomplish tasks with
unprecedented speed, accuracy and scale. To push this idea to its limit, DARPA
launched its Network Challenge, which aimed to ""explore the roles the Internet
and social networking play in the timely communication, wide-area
team-building, and urgent mobilization required to solve broad-scope,
time-critical problems."" The challenge required teams to provide coordinates of
ten red weather balloons placed at different locations in the continental
United States. This large-scale mobilization required the ability to spread
information about the tasks widely and quickly, and to incentivize individuals
to act. We report on the winning team's strategy, which utilized a novel
recursive incentive mechanism to find all balloons in under nine hours. We
analyze the theoretical properties of the mechanism, and present data about its
performance in the challenge."
"Fifty North Sea oil & gas investment transactions were analysed using
traditional spreadsheet based financial modelling methods. The purpose of the
analysis was to determine if there was a statistically significant relationship
between the price paid for an oil & gas asset and the actual or expected
financial return over the asset's economically useful life. Several interesting
and statistically significant relationships were found which reveal useful
information about financial modelling performance, the premia paid to acquire
North Sea assets, the contribution oil and gas price uncertainty has on
estimates of future financial returns and the median financial return of these
North Sea Investments."
"On the Internet large service providers tend to control the digital
identities of users. These defacto identity authorities wield significant power
over users, compelling them to comply with non-negotiable terms, before access
to services is granted. In doing so, users expose themselves to privacy risks,
manipulation and exploitation via direct marketing. Against this backdrop, the
emerging areas of Digital Ecosystems and user-centric identity emphasise
decentralised environments with independent self-determining entities that
control their own data and identity. We show that recent advances in
user-centric identity, federated identity and trust have prepared the ground
for decentralised identity provisioning. We show how social trust, rather than
blind deference to authorities, can provide a basis for identity, where risks
can be weighed and compared rather than merely accepted. Fundamentally, we are
considering the move from authority-centric centralised identity provisioning
to user-centric distributed identity provisioning. Finally, we highlight the
potential impacts of distributed identity provisioning in the Information
Society and give a brief roadmap for its general implementation and adoption."
"USA Government wiretapping activities is a very controversial issue.
Undoubtedly this technology can assist law enforced authority to detect /
identify unlawful or hostile activities; however, this task raises severe
privacy concerns. In this paper, we have discussed this complex information
technology issue of governmental wiretapping and how it effects both public and
private liberties. Legislation has had a major impact on the uses and the
stigma of wiretapping for the war on terrorism. This paper also analyzes the
ethical and legal concerns inherent when discussing the benefits and concerns
of wiretapping. The analysis has concluded with the effects of wiretapping laws
as they relate to future government actions in their fight against terrorists."
"E-commerce is an emerging technology. Impact of this new technology is
getting clearer with time and results are tangible to the user community. In
this paper we have tried to focus some of its issues like paradigms,
infrastructure integration, and security, which is considered to be the most
important issue in E-Commerce. At first we have elaborated the paradigms of
E-Commerce (Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer). Then comes the
necessity of infrastructure integration with the legacy system. Security
concerns comes next. Rest of the part contains conclusion and references."
"The sole goal of E-Governance is to allow interaction of government with

"One of the most effective applications of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) is the emergence of E-Learning. Considering the importance and
need of E-Learning, recent years have seen a drastic change of learning
methodologies in Higher Education. Undoubtedly, the three main entities of
E-Learning system can be considered as Student, Teacher & Controlling Authority
and there will be different level, but a good E-Learning system needs total
integrity among all entities in every level. Apart from integrity enforcement,
security enforcement in the whole system is the other crucial way to organize
the it. As internet is the backbone of the entire system which is inherently
insecure, during transaction of message in E-Learning system, hackers attack by
utilising different loopholes of technology. So different security measures are
required to be imposed on the system. In this paper, emphasis is given on
different risks called e-risks and their remedies called e-remedies to build
trust in the minds of all participants of E-Learning system."
"The informatization practice of countries all over the world has shown that
the level of a government's informatization is one main factor that can affect
its international competitive power. At present, e-government construction is
regarded as one of the most important tasks for the national economy and
society upliftment and informatization in Saudi Arabia. Unlike the traditional
governments, an e-government takes on a new look with its framework and
operation mode more suitable for the contemporary era. In fact, it is a basic
national strategy to promote Saudi Arabia's informatization by means of
e-government construction. This talk firstly introduces the basic concepts and
relevant viewpoints of egovernment, then reviews the development process of
e-government in Saudi Arabia, and describes the current states, development
strategies of e-government in Saudi Arabia. And also review e-government
maturity models and synthesize them e-government maturity models are
investigated, in which the authors have proposed the Delloite's six-stage
model, Layne and Lee four-stage model and Accenture five-stage model. So, the
main e-government maturity stages are: online presence, interaction,
transaction, transformation and digital democracy. After that, according to
many references, the main technologies which are used in each stage are
summarized."
"The semantic e-government is a new application field accompanying the
development of semantic web where the ontologies have become a fertile field of
investigation. This is due firstly to both the complexity and the size of
e-government systems and secondly to the importance of the issues. However,
permitting easy and personalized access to e-government services has become, at
this juncture, an arduous and not spontaneous process. Indeed, the provided
e-gov services to the user represent a critical contact point between
administrations and users. The encountered problems in the e-gov services
retrieving process are: the absence of an integrated one-stop government, the
difficulty of localizing the services' sources, the lack of mastery of search
terms and the deficiency of multilingualism of the online services. In order to
solve these problems, to facilitate access to e-gov services and to satisfy the
needs of potential users, we propose an original approach to this issue. This
approach incorporates a semantic layer as a crucial element in the retrieving
process. It consists in implementing a personalized search system that
integrates ontology of the e-gov domain in this process."
"Fighting criminal activities in our modern societies required the engagement
of intelligent information systems that can analyze crime data geographically
and enable new concepts to be deduced from it. These information systems should
be able to create visualization of such data as well as have the capability of
giving new incite of information, if data is updated whilst maintaining the
previously predicted patterns. This paper proposed the use of Formal Concept
Analysis, or Galois Lattices, a data analysis technique grounded on Lattice
Theory and Propositional Calculus, for the visualization and analysis of crime
data. This method considered the set of common and distinct attributes of
crimes in such a way that categorization are done based on related crime types,
geographical locations and the persons involved."
"We present Dejavu, a system that uses standard cell-phone sensors to provide
accurate and energy-efficient outdoor localization suitable for car navigation.
Our analysis shows that different road landmarks have a unique signature on
cell-phone sensors; For example, going inside tunnels, moving over bumps, going
up a bridge, and even potholes all affect the inertial sensors on the phone in
a unique pattern. Dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach and
leverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered abundant
virtual landmarks, to reset the accumulated error and achieve accurate
localization. To maintain a low energy profile, Dejavu uses only
energy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running for other
purposes. We present the design of Dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing
to automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. Our evaluation
results from implementation on different android devices in both city and
highway driving show that Dejavu can localize cell phones to within 8.4m median
error in city roads and 16.6m on highways. Moreover, compared to GPS and other
state-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by 347%,
achieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging
in-city driving conditions."
"Money laundering is a critical step in the cyber crime process which is
experiencing some changes as hackers and their criminal colleagues continually
alter and optimize payment mechanisms. Conducting quantitative research on
underground laundering activity poses an inherent challenge: Bad guys and their
banks do not share information on criminal pursuits. However, by analyzing
forums, we have identified two growth areas in money laundering: online gaming
and micro laundering."
"The need for process improvement is an important target that does affect as
well the government processes. Specifically in the public sector there are
specific challenges to face.New technology approaches within government
processes such as cloud services are necessary to address these challenges.
Following the current discussion of cloudification of business processes all
processes are considered similar in regards to their usability within the
cloud. The truth is, that neither all processes have the same usability for
cloud services not do they have the same importance for a specific company.The
most comprehensive process within a company is the corporate value chain. In
this article one key proposition is to use the corporate value chain as the
fundamental structuring backbone for all business process analysis and
improvement activities. It is a pre-requisite to identify the core elements of
the value chain that are essential for the individual companys business and the
root cause for any company success. In this paper we propose to use the
company-specific value-creation for the cloud-affinity and the cloud-usability
of a business process in public sector considering the specific challenges of
addressing processes in cloud services. Therefor it is necessary to formalize
the way the processes with its interdependencies are documented in context of
their company-specific value chain (as part of the various deployment- and
governance alternatives. Moreover, it is essential in the public sector to
describe in detail the environmental and external restrictions of processes.
With the use of this proposed methodology it becomes relatively easy to
identify cloud-suitable processes within the public sector and thus optimize
the public companies value generation tightly focused with the use of this new
technology."
"Location-based services gained much popularity through providing users with
helpful information with respect to their current location. The search and
recommendation of nearby locations or places, and the navigation to a specific
location are some of the most prominent location-based services. As a recent
trend, virtual location-based services consider webpages or sites associated
with a location as 'virtual locations' that online users can visit in spite of
not being physically present at the location. The presence of links between
virtual locations and the corresponding physical locations (e.g., geo-location
information of a restaurant linked to its website), allows for novel types of
services and applications which constitute virtual location-based services
(VLBS). The quality and potential benefits of such services largely depends on
the existence of websites referring to physical locations. In this paper, we
investigate the usefulness of linking virtual and physical locations. For this,
we analyze the presence and distribution of virtual locations, i.e., websites
referring to places, for two Irish cities. Using simulated tracks based on a
user movement model, we investigate how mobile users move through the Web as
virtual space. Our results show that virtual locations are omnipresent in urban
areas, and that the situation that a user is close to even several such
locations at any time is rather the normal case instead of the exception."
"We measure synergy for the Russian national, provincial, and regional
innovation systems as reduction of uncertainty using mutual information among
the three distributions of firm sizes, technological knowledge-bases of firms,
and geographical locations. Half a million data at firm level in 2011 were
obtained from the Orbis database of Bureau Van Dijk. The firm level data were
aggregated at the levels of eight Federal Districts, the regional level of 83
Federal Subjects, and the single level of the Russian Federation. Not
surprisingly, the knowledge base of the economy is concentrated in the Moscow
region (22.8%); St. Petersburg follows with 4.0%. Only 0.4% of the firms are
classified as high-tech, and 2.7% as medium-tech manufacturing (NACE, Rev. 2).
Except in Moscow itself, high-tech manufacturing does not add synergy to any
other unit at any of the various levels of geographical granularity; instead it
disturbs regional coordination even in the region surrounding Moscow (""Moscow
Region""). In the case of medium-tech manufacturing, there is also synergy in
St. Petersburg. Knowledge-intensive services (KIS; including laboratories)
contribute 12.8% to the economy in terms of establishments and contribute to
the synergy in all Federal Districts (except the North-Caucasian Federal
District), but only in 30 of the 83 Federal Subjects. The synergy in KIS is
concentrated in centers of administration. Unlike Western European countries,
the knowledge-intensive services (which are often state-affiliated) thus
provide backbone to an emerging knowledge-based economy at the level of Federal
Districts, but the economy is otherwise not knowledge-based (except for the
Moscow region)."
"In many work environments, serendipitous interactions between members of
different groups may lead to enhanced productivity, collaboration and knowledge
dissemination. Two factors that may have an influence on such interactions are
cultural differences between individuals in highly multicultural workplaces,
and the layout and physical spaces of the workplace itself. In this work, we
investigate how these two factors may facilitate or hinder inter-group
interactions in the workplace. We analyze traces collected using wearable
electronic badges to capture face-to-face interactions and mobility patterns of
employees in a research laboratory in the UK. We observe that those who
interact with people of different roles tend to come from collectivist cultures
that value relationships and where people tend to be comfortable with social
hierarchies, and that some locations in particular are more likely to host
serendipitous interactions, knowledge that could be used by organizations to
enhance communication and productivity."
"This research paper conducts a survey of the various government organizations
that are using Web 2.0 to enhance their functionality, interact with potential
audience and to reach out to a huge customer base. The aim of the paper is to
study the role of Web 2.0 in E-Governance and the various benefits that has
been achieved through it. This research paper is based on qualitative case
study method. We have reviewed existing state-of-the-art Web 2.0 applications
and E-Governance initiatives related with Web 2.0. We have included case
studies to support the proposition that use of Web 2.0 can enhance the
participation of citizens in E-Governance initiatives in an interactive manner.
This paper proposes that many of the government organizations can exploit the
benefits of Web 2.0 and hence can leverage its flexibility and interactive
nature. The study concludes that by establishing links with the social
networks, it is possible to reach a much wider audience easily and cost
effectively. The use of Web 2.0 applications can also bring out the
transparency in the government affairs. The Number of government organizations
embracing this new technology is on increase. The paper had surveyed few
organizations which are using Web 2.0 tools to enhance their operations."
"The rate of disability is increase day by day all over the world .There are
various type of Disabilities but the deaf persons are on second number among
all types of disabilities.. In most of the countries disabled persons are
supposed to be social liability on their family and in the society as awhile.
Now days in developing countries it is difficult for normal persons to get
suitable jobs. Whenever we are talking about disabled, it is more difficult to
assimilate deaf persons in workplace. Threats of unemployment of disabled
person are almost double that of people without disabilities. Number of able
deaf persons is unable to get suitable job due to several reasons like lack of
facilities for deaf persons and lack of awareness from normal persons side
which create barrier in searching job for deaf persons. This research work
emphasis on the special need and training required for the deaf individual sand
to make and train them how to move in workplace with different social and
technical barrier. In recent era technology play important role in each and
every part of life. Using the facility of Information and communication
Technology we can easily assimilate deaf in workplace. The proposed model helps
deaf persons to adjust in their jobs."
"There are various types of disability egress in world like blindness,
deafness, and Physical disabilities. It is quite difficult to deal with people
with disability. Learning disability (LD) is types of disability totally
different from general disability. To deal children with learning disability is
difficult for both parents and teacher. As parent deal with only single child
so it bit easy. But teacher deals with different students at a time so its more
difficult to deal with group of students with learning disability. If there is
more students with learning disability so it is necessary that first all
identify the type of learning disability in group of students. Some students
have learning disability of mathematics; some have learning disability of other
subjects. By using theory of Automata it easy to analysis the level of
disability among all students then deal with them accordingly. For these
purpose deterministic automata is the best practice. Teacher deals with
deterministic students in class and check there response. In this research
deterministic automata is use to facilitated the teacher which help teacher in
identification of students with learning disability."
"Land use classification is essential for urban planning. Urban land use types
can be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as
reflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have
been recognized as a vital method for urban land use classification because of
their ability to capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although
significant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for
urban land use classification, most techniques focus on physical
characteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used.
Owing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which
can be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to
indicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the
opportunity to derive land use information from mobile phone data. To verify
the application of this new data source to urban land use classification, we
first construct a time series of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize
land use types. This time series is composed of two aspects: the hourly
relative pattern, and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means
clustering approach is then applied to infer the land use types. The method is
validated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is
determined with a detection rate of 58.03%. An analysis of the land use
classification results shows that the accuracy decreases as the heterogeneity
of land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers
increases."
"As of today, the main business application of onomastics is naming, or
branding: finding the proper name for your company or your product to stand out
in the world. Meaningfully, Onoma, the Greek root for name, is also a
registered trademark of Nomen, the naming agency founded by Marcel Botton in
1981. Nomen initially licensed one of Roland Moreno's inventions, the Radoteur
name generator, and created many distinctive and global brand names such as:
Vinci, Clio or Amundi. But once your business has a name, should you forget
about onomastics? Not anymore. Globalization, digitalization and the Big Data
open new fields to experiment disruptive applications in Sales and Marketing,
Communication, HR and Risk Management. Though discriminating names carries a
high risk of abuse, it can also drive new, unexpected ways for developing poor
areas."
"Although the research support for Cloud Computing (CC) is still developing,
the concept of this paper has provided comprehensive frameworks for a
successful migration to cloud computing (SMCC) in telecommunication industry in
Iran. Using an academic orientation, the conceptual research is focusing on the
determinants of a successful migration from legacy to cloud computing. The
study attempts to reveal the constructive effects and deconstructive defects of
migration to cloud computing with a close regard into prior literature and
practical practices all around the world. Conceptual frameworks are deducted
from the literature and Telco's revolutionary movements toward cloud computing.
The confirmatory quantitative approach tries to verify or reject the validity
of determinants of successful migration. The study reports that there are some
success and failure factors which are influencing a successful migration of
data centres and servers of Iranian Telecommunication to the cloud. Considering
these approved factors before any migration decision would be valuable for
engaged project members and finally for Telecommunication organization. This
paper can be used as reliable model for any migration beforehand taking any
action. Enforcing proper determinants in accordance with the prior success
stories and academia viewpoints in Telecommunication industry in Iran as a
first mover research in this field provides a precious insight for policy and
decision makers to change their mindset and grant a proper space for cloud
computing to grow in this industry due to its advantages. Obviously, like any
other big Telco in the world, Iranian Telco might start cloud projects to
sustain its presence in the global market."
"The aim of this paper is to describe a basic idea to introduce formal
modeling in development and presentation of e-learning systems. By introducing
formalism, reasoning on e-learning systems and processes through them can be
more easily understood. In particular, we propose to use Harel automata
(statecharts) in modeling sequencing and navigation through learning content
and learning process."
"The modern workplace is inherently collaborative, and this collaboration
relies on effective communication among coworkers. Instant messaging is the
multitasking tools of choice most people chatting over IM do other things at
the same time.The use of IM in workplace is less intrusive than the use of
phone, more immediate than email and has added advantage due to the ability to
detect presence.In order for institution to maximize increased business
productivity using instant messaging its imperative that organizations define
and publish ICT policies, guidelines and regulations.Overall IM boosts business
performance by making operations faster, more agile, and more efficient with
very little additional cost thus Organizations that deploy IM would reap
significant Return on Investment.Institutions should adopt IM meetings which
are be more efficient and less prone to straying off topic, because of the
relative effort of typing versus talking."
"Due to the evolving Cloud Computing paradigm, there is a prevailing concern
that in the near future data center managers may be in short supply. Cloud
computing, as a whole, is becoming more prevalent into today s computing world.
In fact, cloud computing has become so popular that some are now referring to
data centers as cloud centers. How does this interest in cloud computing
translate into employment rates for data center managers? The popularity of the
public and private cloud models are the prevailing force behind answering this
question. Therefore, the skill set of the datacenter manager has evolved to
harness the on demand self-services, broad network access, resource pooling,
rapid elasticity, measured service, and multi tenacity characteristics of cloud
computing. Using diverse sources ranging from the Bureau of Labor and
Statistics to trade articles, this manuscript takes an in-depth look at these
employment rates related to the cloud and the determining factors behind them.
Based on the information available, datacenter manager employment rates in the
cloud computing era will continue to increase well into 2016."
"This article addresses the emergent phenomenon of carto-vandalism, the
intentional defacement of collaborative cartographic digital artefacts in the
context of volunteered geographic information. Through a qualitative analysis
of reported incidents in WikiMapia and OpenStreetMap, a typology of this kind
of vandalism is outlined, including play, ideological, fantasy, artistic, and
industrial carto-vandalism, as well as carto-spam. Two families of
counter-strategies deployed in amateur mapping communities are discussed.
First, the contributors organise forms of policing, based on volunteered
community involvement, patrolling the maps and reporting incidents. Second, the
detection of carto-vandalism can be supported by automated tools, based either
on explicit rules or on machine learning."
"Technological innovation is an important aspect of teaching and learning in
the 21st century. This article examines faculty attitudes toward technology use
in the classroom at one regional public university in the United States.
Building on a faculty-led initiative to develop a Community of Practice for
improving education, this study used a mixed-method approach of a
faculty-developed, electronic survey to assess this topic. Findings from 72
faculty members revealed an overall positive stance toward technology in the
classroom and the average faculty member utilized about six technology tools in
their courses. The opportunities, barriers and future uses for technologies in
the higher education classroom emerged from the open-ended questions on the
survey. One finding of particular concern is that faculty are fearful that
technology causes a loss of the humanistic perspective in education. The

"The primary challenge in SCM pedagogy is the learners interaction with the
dynamic nature of supply chain transactions. Once achieved, it is also required
to evaluate learners learning experience based on their performance. In this
paper, a combination of outcome-based education (OBE) and simulation-based
education is proposed focusing on beer game theory. The analysis is based on
336 runs of beer game simulation within a target group of 56 participants
divided into 14 subgroups (SG1-SG14).The purpose of the study is mainly to
investigate the effect of mutual interactions on students learning process
using supply chain total cost and ordering fluctuations as critical measurement
criteria."
"While Artificial Intelligence has successfully outperformed humans in complex
combinatorial games (such as chess and checkers), humans have retained their
supremacy in social interactions that require intuition and adaptation, such as
cooperation and coordination games. Despite significant advances in learning
algorithms, most algorithms adapt at times scales which are not relevant for
interactions with humans, and therefore the advances in AI on this front have
remained of a more theoretical nature. This has also hindered the experimental
evaluation of how these algorithms perform against humans, as the length of
experiments needed to evaluate them is beyond what humans are reasonably
expected to endure (max 100 repetitions). This scenario is rapidly changing, as
recent algorithms are able to converge to their functional regimes in shorter
time-scales. Additionally, this shift opens up possibilities for experimental
investigation: where do humans stand compared with these new algorithms? We
evaluate humans experimentally against a representative element of these
fast-converging algorithms. Our results indicate that the performance of at
least one of these algorithms is comparable to, and even exceeds, the
performance of people."
"Nowadays, scripting programming languages like Python, Perl and Ruby are
widely used in system programming, scientific computing, etc. Although solving
a particular problem in these languages requires less time, less programming
effort, and less concepts to be taught to achieve the desired goal, still they
are not used as teaching tools. Therefore, the use of scripting languages as a
teaching vehicle for programming course is very promising. On the other hand,
GUI programming, when performed with such languages, is easy and rewarding,
since one sees the result of her work immediately. Thus, we are sure that
scripting languages combined with GUI toolkits will be the next big thing in
computer education."

"In modern advanced emergency management systems many solutions for decision
support have been provided as attempts to support humans to take important
decisions for the critical situations recovery. The critical situation
detection is a complex procedure that involves both human and machine
activities and leads to take a decision for the management and situation
recovery. This paper presents an approach for critical situation detection
which uses event correlation technologies performing online analysis of real
events through a Complex Event Processing architecture. Event correlation is
used to relate events gathered from various sources, including crowd sensing
and crowd sourcing sources, for detecting patterns and situations of interest
in the emergency management context."
"In this position paper we describe the current status and plans for a Swiss
National Research Infrastructure. Swiss academic and research institutions are
very autonomous. While being loosely coupled, they do not rely on any
centralized management entities. Therefore, a coordinated national research
infrastructure can only be established by federating the various resources
available locally at the individual institutions. The Swiss Multi-Science
Computing Grid and the Swiss Academic Compute Cloud projects serve already a
large number of diverse user communities. These projects also allow us to test
the operational setup of such a heterogeneous federated infrastructure."
"This article explores some of the challenges faced when managing virtual
teams, in particular the role played by trust and identity in virtual teams. It
outlines why teams and virtual teams have become a valuable part of the modern
organization and presents ten short case studies that illustrate the range of
activities in which virtual teams can be found. Following this, the article
examines some of the common problems encountered in virtual team working. It
discusses two broad classes of solutions. The first are solutions that are
essentially technical in nature (i.e., where changes to or improvements in
technology would help to solve or ameliorate the problem); the second are more
organizationally based (i.e., where the root of the problem is in people and
how they are managed). The article concludes that both the technical and the
organizational solutions need to be considered in parallel if an attempt to
build an effective virtual team is to be successful."

"Studies in the social capital literature have documented two stylised facts:
first, a decline in measures of social participation has occurred in many OECD
countries. Second, and more recently, the success of social networking sites
(SNSs) has resulted in a steep rise in online social participation. Our study
adds to this body of research by conducting the first empirical assessment of
how online networking affects two economically relevant aspects of social
capital, i.e. trust and sociability. We address endogeneity in online
networking by exploiting technological characteristics of the pre-existing
voice telecommunication infrastructures that exogenously determined the
availability of broadband for high-speed Internet. We find that participation
in SNSs such as Facebook and Twitter has a positive effect on face-to-face
interactions. However, social trust decreases with online interactions. We
argue that the rising practice of hate speech may play a crucial role in the
destruction of trust."
"Innovative, real-time solutions are needed to address the mismatch between
the demand for and supply of critical information to inform and motivate diet

mobile health technologies hold great promise for influencing knowledge,
attitudes, and behaviors related to energy balance. The objective of this paper
is to present insights related to the development and testing of a mobile food
recommendation system targeting fast food restaurants. The system is designed
to provide consumers with information about energy density of food options
combined with tips for healthier choices when dining out, accessible through a
mobile phone."
"A building's environment has profound influence on occupant comfort and
health. Continuous monitoring of building occupancy and environment is
essential to fault detection, intelligent control, and building commissioning.
Though many solutions for environmental measuring based on wireless sensor
networks exist, they are not easily accessible to households and building
owners who may lack time or technical expertise needed to set up a system and
get quick and detailed overview of environmental conditions.
  Building-in-Briefcase (BiB) is a portable sensor network platform that is
trivially easy to deploy in any building environment. Once the sensors are
distributed, the environmental data is collected and communicated to the BiB
router via TCP/IP protocol and WiFi technology which then forwards the data to
the central database securely over the internet through a 3G radio. The user,
with minimal effort, can access the aggregated data and visualize the trends in
real time on the BiB web portal. Paramount to the adoption and continued
operation of an indoor sensing platform is battery lifetime. This design has
achieved a multi-year lifespan by careful selection of components, an efficient
binary communications protocol and data compression. Our BiB sensor is capable
of collecting a rich set of environmental parameters, and is expandable to
measure others, such as CO2. This paper describes the power characteristics of
BiB sensors and their occupancy estimation and activity recognition
functionality. Our vision is large-scale deployment of BiB in thousands of
buildings, which would provide ample research opportunities and opportunities
to identify ways to improve the building environment and energy efficiency."
"The development of ICT has emerged a new way of learning using electronic
platforms: E-learning. In addition, pedagogical approaches have been adopted in
teaching based on group learning, such as the project-based teaching. The
project-based teaching is an active learning method, based on group work to
develop skills and acquire knowledge. However, the group of students is facing
several challenges throughout the project, such as the decision-making group.
The group decision generates convergences and divergences among members. Our
approach in this article relates to the calculation of the homogeneity of a
group of learners during decision making in an educational project."
"Economies are instances of complex socio-technical systems that are shaped by
the interactions of large numbers of individuals. The individual behavior and
decision-making of consumer agents is determined by complex psychological
dynamics that include their own assessment of present and future economic
conditions as well as those of others, potentially leading to feedback loops
that affect the macroscopic state of the economic system. We propose that the
large-scale interactions of a nation's citizens with its online resources can
reveal the complex dynamics of their collective psychology, including their
assessment of future system states. Here we introduce a behavioral index of
Chinese Consumer Confidence (C3I) that computationally relates large-scale
online search behavior recorded by Google Trends data to the macroscopic
variable of consumer confidence. Our results indicate that such computational
indices may reveal the components and complex dynamics of consumer psychology
as a collective socio-economic phenomenon, potentially leading to improved and
more refined economic forecasting."

"In an era of software crisis, the move of firms towards
geographically-distributed software development teams is being challenged by
collaboration issues. On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some
light, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source
community have been recurrently reported. While practitioners move with
difficulties towards globally distributed software development, there is a lack
of research addressing the collaboration dynamics of large-scale distributed
software projects. More particularly, even if there are empirical
manifestations of collaboration among software-houses that market
rival-software products within the same market, there is a clear lack of
research addressing the development of information systems by coopetitive
manners. While addressing a previous call for the advancement of methods and
techniques to support the visualization of temporal aspects to represent change
and evolution in ecosystems, we combined and virtual-ethnography (VA) with a
Social Network Analysis (SNA) over publicly-available and naturally-occurring
data that allowed us to re-construct and visualize the evolution of the WebKit
collaboration in a sequence of networks. We started by screening, publicly
available data such as company announcements, financial reports and
specialized-press that allowed us to gain insights of the industrial context.
After attaining a better understanding of the the competitive dynamics of the
mobile-devices and PC industries, we started extracting and analyzing the
social network of the WebKit community leveraging SNA, which is an emergent
method widely established across disciplines of social sciences in general.Our
case confirmed much of the established literature on coopetition, but more
detailed observations revealed that not all coopetition theoretical
propositions can be generalized to the open-source arena."

"With the rise of cheap small-cells in wireless cellular networks, there are
new opportunities for third party providers to service local regions via
sharing arrangements with traditional operators. In fact, such arrangements are
highly desirable for large facilities---such as stadiums, universities, and
mines---as they already need to cover property costs, and often have fibre
backhaul and efficient power infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a new
network sharing arrangement between large facilities and traditional operators.
Our facility network sharing arrangement consists of two aspects: leasing of
core network access and spectrum from traditional operators; and service
agreements with users. Importantly, our incorporation of a user service
agreement into the arrangement means that resource allocation must account for
financial as well as physical resource constraints. This introduces a new
non-trivial dimension into wireless network resource allocation, which requires
a new evaluation framework---the data rate is no longer the only main
performance metric. Moreover, despite clear economic incentives to adopt
network sharing for facilities, a business case is lacking. As such, we develop
a general socio-technical evaluation framework based on ruin-theory, where the
key metric for the sharing arrangement is the probability that the facility has
less than zero revenue surplus. We then use our framework to evaluate our
facility network sharing arrangement, which offers guidance for leasing and
service agreement negotiations, as well as design of the wireless network
architecture, taking into account network revenue streams."

"Heart rate monitoring using wrist-type photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals
during subjects' intensive exercise is a difficult problem, since the signals
are contaminated by extremely strong motion artifacts caused by subjects' hand
movements. So far few works have studied this problem. In this work, a general
framework, termed TROIKA, is proposed, which consists of signal decomposiTion
for denoising, sparse signal RecOnstructIon for high-resolution spectrum
estimation, and spectral peaK trAcking with verification. The TROIKA framework
has high estimation accuracy and is robust to strong motion artifacts. Many
variants can be straightforwardly derived from this framework. Experimental
results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak
speed of 15 km/hour showed that the average absolute error of heart rate
estimation was 2.34 beat per minute (BPM), and the Pearson correlation between
the estimates and the ground-truth of heart rate was 0.992. This framework is
of great values to wearable devices such as smart-watches which use PPG signals
to monitor heart rate for fitness."
"Games are a popular form of entertainment. However, many computer games
present unnecessary barriers to players with sensory, motor and cognitive
impairments. In order to overcome such pitfalls, an awareness of their impact
and a willingness to apply inclusive design practice is often necessary. The
Global Game Jam offers a potential avenue to promote inclusive design practices
to students of game development. As such, this paper evaluates the impact of an
initiative to promote inclusive design practices during the 2014 Global Game
Jam. An attitude questionnaire was distributed to both participants and
non-participants at one event venue. The results indicate that, having enrolled
in the initiative, students' attitudes improved. Furthermore, all attendees
reported they were likely to pursue further learning opportunities and consider
accessibility issues in their future games. This suggests that the Global Game
Jam, and other similar events, present an attractive avenue to promote
inclusive design practice within the context of digital game development.
However, further analysis of submitted games, additional qualitative inquiry
and a large-scale trial are needed to determine impact on practice and to form
recommendations for future events."

"This paper addresses policy challenges of complex virtual environments such
as virtual worlds, social network sites, and massive multiplayer online games.
The complexity of these environments--apparent by the rich user interactions

"Keeping the health condition at the juvenile population is the concern of
both the medical staff and the physical education teachers. Considering the
steady tendency of the growth of the number of the youth with excessive weight
(overweighted or obese) the intervention to combat this phenomenon must be
initiated in the early stage when this condition occurs. The screening method
for evaluating the body weight presented in this study uses a calculus program
through which, based on the input data (age, sex, weight the width of the skin
fold) an evaluation regarding each juvenile's weight and the body structure can
be done. This program can be used in schools, high schools, universities, to
signal the weight excess and to appreciate the intervention results for getting
a normal weight."

"In computer science, students could benefit from more opportunities to learn
important, high-level concepts and to improve their learning skills. Peer
review is one method to encourage this by providing students with the
opportunity to evaluate other people's work and to receive feedback on their
own projects. This allows for rich learning experience but it is not
immediately obvious how to create a programming project review that will
improve the students' conceptual understanding, require higher level thinking,
and be engaging. The current literature does not typically address differences
between review implementations or provide reasons for design decisions. This
work explored how two different types of reviews affected the students'
learning of concepts, high-level thinking, and engagement. There were
indications that the type of review affected how well students addressed the
concept they were reviewing and the comments' length. This shows that the
review's type may affect student engagement and conceptual learning. There were
also differences in how they reviewed the concepts of Abstraction,
Decomposition, and Encapsulation, suggesting that the concepts are being
learned in different ways. Both of these results have an impact on the use of
peer review computer science but need further investigation."

"The phenomenon described as ""information criminality"" has taken significant
proportions in the last decade, fact that carried out towards an international
legislative frame, by implementing judicial forms, which might stop its
occurrences. As matter of fact, the information criminality represents an
information technology aiming towards fraud and prejudicing the users of
informational data, by various means to infringement of the law. In this way,
some international organizations have dealt with performing a legislative
framework, able to punish the phenomenon of information criminality and
implicitly to protect the users of computers. The transnational expansions,
extremely fast as concerns the computer networks, and extending the access to
these networks, by means of mobile telephony, have brought the increasing of
these systems' vulnerability and the creating of opportunities of breaking the
law. Considering these aspects, the world legislation is continuously changing,
due to a more and more accelerated development of the information technology."

be taken to address this issue seriously. This paper discusses some of the
measures that have been implemented so that this gap is reduced and software
engineers with better skills are produced. Changes to curriculum,
industry-academia collaboration through conferences, sabbaticals etc., industry
internships and live projects for final year students are some of the measures
that have been discussed in this paper. The implementation of these measures

"The Privacy Coach is an application running on a mobile phone that supports
customers in making privacy decisions when confronted with RFID tags. The
approach we take to increase customer privacy is a radical departure from the
mainstream research efforts that focus on implementing privacy enhancing
technologies on the RFID tags themselves. Instead the Privacy Coach functions
as a mediator between customer privacy preferences and corporate privacy
policies, trying to find a match between the two, and informing the user of the
outcome. In this paper we report on the architecture of the Privacy Coach, and
show how it enables users to make informed privacy decisions in a user-friendly
manner. We also spend considerable time to discuss lessons learnt and to
describe future plans to further improve on the Privacy Coach concept."
"Our aim is to propose a collaborative methodological approach centred on
learners and based on the Web 2.0 tools in order to make E-learning 2.0. It is
based on a process consisting of four iterative steps which are: grouping,
collaborating, validating and publishing content. In this context, learners
will be the creators of the content of assigned courses in a virtual meeting
through the chat. These contents will be validated after a pedagogical
monitoring by the instructor through the class's blog and merged into a single
course content published on a class wiki. Social interaction and sharing of
files on the web will be the responsibility of social networks. The rest of the
web 2.0 tools such as RSS feeds, tags, podcasts and video casts will be used as
complementary tools in order to improve the quality of training. This
methodological approach will allow E-learning 2.0 by ensuring a better
interactivity, collaboration, sharing and an optimal exploitation of
collaborative intelligence in the classroom."
"The Personality and emotions are effective parameters in learning process.
Thus, virtual learning environments should pay attention to these parameters.
In this paper, a new e-learning model is designed and implemented according to
these parameters. The Virtual learning environment that is presented here uses
two agents: Virtual Tutor Agent (VTA), and Virtual Classmate Agent (VCA).
During the learning process and depending on events happening in the
environment, learner's emotions are changed. In this situation, learning style
should be revised according to the personality traits as well as the learner's
current emotions. VTA selects suitable learning style for the learners based on
their personality traits. To improve the learning process, the system uses VCA
in some of the learning steps. VCA is an intelligent agent and has its own
personality. It is designed so that it can present an attractive and real
learning environment in interaction with the learner. To recognize the
learner's personality, this system uses MBTI test and to obtain emotion values
uses OCC model. Finally, the results of system tested in real environments show
that considering the human features in interaction with the learner increases
learning quality and satisfies the learner."

seen in last few decades that the progress of information technology with leaps
and bounds, which have completely changed the way of life in the developed
nations. While internet has changed the established working practice and opened
new vistas and provided a platform to connect, this gives the opportunity for
collaborative work space that goes beyond the global boundary. We are living in
the global economy and India leading towards Liberalize Market Oriented Economy
(LMOE). Considering this things, focusing on GIS, we proposed a system for
collection of socio economic data and water resource management information of
rural area via internet."
"E-learning; enhanced by communicating and interacting is becoming
increasingly accepted and this puts Web 2.0 at the center of the new
educational technologies. E-Learning 2.0 emerges as an innovative method of
online learning for its incorporation of Web 2.0 tools. For any academic study,
the curriculum provides overview of intact learning area. The Curriculum
provides overview to content of the Subject. Many institutions place student
interaction as a priority of their online curriculum design. It is proved that
interaction has a great effect on the students' involvement in learning and
acceptance of Curriculum. Students are accepting curriculum that is designed by
teacher; whereas E-learning 2.0 enabled Curriculum management system allows
student to involve in learning activities. It works as a stimulus and increases
their dedication to the Curriculum. While Institute adapts E-Learning 2.0 as
Learning Management System, it also provides Social Networking services and
provides direct and transparent interaction between students and teachers. This
view of the e-Learning 2.0 shifts its focus from LMS to the students, equipping
them, with the means to become ever more autonomous, accepting them to make use
of these means in solving problems on their own initiative. Curriculum usage
will empower student involvement and enhancing E-learning 2.0 spreading. This
paper, analyzing implementation E-learning 2.0 for Curriculum management and
discusses Opportunities & Challenges for Curriculum over Web 2.0."

list and a bibliography are included."
"Mobile commerce is enabling the development of additional revenue streams for
organizations through the delivery of chargeable mobile services. According to
the European Information Technology Observatory, the total amount of revenue
generated by mobile commerce was reported to be less than {\pounds}9 million in
the United Kingdom in 2001. By 2005 this had, at least, doubled and more recent
industry forecasts project significant global growth in this area. Mobile
commerce creates a range of business opportunities and new revenue streams for
businesses across industry sectors via the deployment of innovative services,
applications and associated information content. This paper presents a review
of mobile commerce business models and their importance for the creation of
mobile commerce solutions."
"Internet generation is growing accustomed to having broadband access wherever
they go and not just at home or in the office, which turns mobile broadband
into a reality. This paper aims to look for a suitable mobile broadband
solution in the South Asian region through comparative analysis in various
perspectives. Both WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies designed to move data
rather than voice having IP networks based on OFDM technology. Proving
competency in various significant aspects WiMAX and LTE already have made a
strong position in telecommunication industry. Again, because of certain
similarities in technology; they aren't like technological rivals as of GSM and
CDMA. But still they are treated as opponents and viewed as a major threat in
case of the flourishing of each other. Such view point is surely not conducive
for getting the best out of them. In this paper various aspects and
applications of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. South Asia
being the residence of an enormous number of people presents an exciting
opportunity for mobile operators, developers and internet service providers.
So, every consideration that has been made here also correlates successfully
with south Asia i.e. how mass people of this region may be benefited from it.
As a result, it might be regarded as a good source in case of making major BWA
deployment decisions in this region. Besides these, it also opens the path for
further research and thinking in this issue."
"This paper looks at what happens when Communities of Practice are used as a
tool for Knowledge Management. The original concept of a Community of Practice
appears to have very little in common with the knowledge sharing communities
found in Knowledge Management, which are based on a revised view of
'cultivated' communities. We examine the risks and benefits of cultivating
Communities of Practice rather than leaving them 'in the wild'. The paper
presents the findings from two years of research in a small microelectronics
firm to provide some insights into the wild vs domesticated dichotomy and
discusses the implications of attempting to tame Communities of Practice in
this way."
"Popularity of content in social media is unequally distributed, with some
items receiving a disproportionate share of attention from users. Predicting
which newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for
both companies that host social media sites and their users. Accurate and
timely prediction would enable the companies to maximize revenue through
differential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would
also give consumers an important tool for filtering the ever-growing amount of
content. Predicting popularity of content in social media, however, is
challenging due to the complex interactions among content quality, how the
social media site chooses to highlight content, and influence among users.
While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity \emph{a priori}, we
show that stochastic models of user behavior on these sites allows predicting
popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating
aspects of the web site design, such models improve on predictions based on
simply extrapolating from the early votes. We validate this claim on the social
news portal Digg using a previously-developed model of social voting based on
the Digg user interface."
"One of the fastest evolving field among teaching and learning research is
students' performance evaluation. Computer based testing systems are
increasingly adopted by universities. However, the implementation and
maintenance of such a system and its underlying item bank is a challenge for an
inexperienced tutor. Therefore, this paper discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) systems compared to Computer
Based Test systems. Furthermore, a few item selection strategies are compared
in order to overcome the item exposure drawback of such systems. The paper also
presents our CAT system along its development steps. Besides, an item
difficulty estimation technique is presented based on data taken from our
self-assessment system."

"Currently, mobility presents itself as a major innovation in historic
technological revolution. From the first decade of this century, nothing
compares to what happened in the field of Information Technology (IT), which is
adding to market a range of news relating to infrastructure such as mobile
computing hardware, software, computer networks, etc.. From a handheld as a
wireless device, iPad, Smartphone, you can connect to the digital world,
people, customers, business partners, etc.. Given the infinite range of
information, services and resources available in the electronic world, it is
considered that few are those, markets and people who want to be left behind.
The interest in this channel of communication becomes not only a new strategy
of marketing and communications. Mobile devices are becoming more sophisticated

"E-learning has been an important policy for education planners for many years
in developed countries. This policy has been adopted by education in some
developing countries; it is therefore expedient to study its emergence in the
Nigerian education system. The birth of contemporary technology shows that
there is higher requirement for education even in the work force. This has been
an eye opener to importance of Education which conveniently can be achieved
through E-learning. This work presents CITADEL E-learning approach to Nigeria
institutions; its ubiquity, its implementations, its flexibility, portability,
ease of use and feature that are synonymous to the standard of education in
Nigeria and how it can be enhanced to improve learning for both educators and
learners to help them in their learning endeavour."
"The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the PKI project
initiated part of the UAE national ID card program. It primarily shows the
operational model of the PKI implementation that is indented to integrate the
federal government identity management infrastructure with e-government
initiatives owners in the country. It also explicates the agreed structure of
the major components in relation to key stakeholders; represented by federal
and local e-government authorities, financial institutions, and other
organizations in both public and private sectors. The content of this article
is believed to clarify some of the misconceptions about PKI implementation in
national ID schemes, and explain how the project is envisaged to encourage the
diffusion of e-government services in the United Arab Emirates. The study
concludes that governments in the Middle East region have the trust in PKI
technology to support their e-government services and expanding outreach and
population trust, if of course accompanied by comprehensive digital laws and
policies."
"Despite the immeasurable investment in e-government initiatives throughout
the world, such initiatives have yet to succeed in fully meeting expectations
and desired outcomes. A key objective of this research article is to support
the government of the UAE in realizing its vision of e-government
transformation. It presents an innovative framework to support e-government
implementation, which was developed from a practitioner's perspective and based
on learnings from numerous e-government practices around the globe. The
framework presents an approach to guide governments worldwide, and UAE in
particular, to develop a top down strategy and leverage technology in order
realize its long term goal of e-government transformation. The study also
outlines the potential role of modern national identity schemes in enabling the
transformation of traditional identities into digital identities. The work
presented in this study is envisaged to help bridge the gap between policy
makers and implementers, by providing greater clarity and reducing misalignment
on key elements of e-government transformation. In the hands of leaders that
have a strong will to invest in e-government transformation, the work presented
in this study is envisaged to become a powerful tool to communicate and
coordinate initiatives, and provide a clear visualization of an integrated
approach to e-government transformation."
"This paper focuses on the characteristics of two big triggers that
facilitated wide user adoption of the Internet: Web 2.0 and online social
networks. We detect brakes for reproduction of these events in Internet of
things. To support our hypothesis we first compare the difference between the
ways of use of the Internet with the future scenarios of Internet of things. We
detect barriers that could slow down apparition of this kind of social events
during user adoption of Internet of Things and we propose a conceptual
framework to solve these problems."
"This article is about the author's experience with developing and teaching an
introductory electrical engineering course for students of Faculty (department)
of Information Technology of a Russian university. The curriculum of this
department conforms to typical computer science curricula of US engineering
schools with a noticeable omission of comparable electrical engineering
courses. When developing the course, I did my best to pay attention to learning
preferences of the department's student body. I also hoped to contribute to a
degree to meeting labor market demands for developers of electrical engineering
CAD software. As for inspiration, I was enchanted with ideas of the Mead &
Conway revolution, albeit indirectly related to my enterprise."
"Information and knowledge in exchange in public networks is a crucial
challenge that needs to be overcome in order to consolidate the benefits
associated with such structures. We study the impact of the nature of the
information exchanged over the possibilities of success of this process, basing
ourselves on the analysis of the information produced by the members of the
Network of National Educational Portals. One of the main challenges that the
Network of National Educational Portals faces consists in finding effective
ways of sharing information that can promote knowledge transfer between members
of the network. We argue that a key factor that prevents information sharing is
the use of performance metrics by portal responsibles to evaluate the results
of their decisions. These metrics are highly sensitive, context-dependent, and
produced through non-standardized methods, all of which reduce the willingness
of knowledge sharing. We present a different approach: based on the Network of
National Educational Portals case, we propose creating a comprehensive
information system aimed at providing reliable and timely information in a
systematic fashion. We believe that adopting standardized procedures and
indicators of less sensitive nature, we can produce information for all
partners without the shortcomings of the usual practices."
"Instant e-Teaching is a new concept that supplements e-Teaching and
e-Learning environment in providing a full and comprehensive modern education
styles. The e-Learning technology depicts the concept of enabling self-learning
among students on a certain subject using online reference and materials. While
the instant e-teaching requires 'face-to-face' characteristic between teacher
and student to simultaneously execute actions and gain instant responses. The
word instant enhances the e- Teaching with the concept of real time teaching.
The challenge to exercise online and instant teaching is not just merely
relying on the technologies and system efficiency, but it needs to satisfy the
usability and friendliness of the system as to replicate the traditional class
environment during the deliveries of the class. For this purpose, an instant
e-Teaching framework is been developed that will emulate a dedicated virtual
classroom, and primarily designed for synchronous and live sharing of current
teaching notes. The model has been demonstrated using a teaching Arabic
recitation prototype and evaluated from the professional user profession's
perspectives."
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for Nigerian universities to go it
alone in terms of serving as a citadel of learning, coping with the huge wage
bill and competing with their peers in other parts of the world, due to
competitive, economic and other pressures. As a consequence, Nigerian
universities are left with no option than to carry their industrial partners
along in terms of research and development through the formation of
partnerships for their mutual benefit. Since the industries are established for
profit making and the universities for knowledge enhancement, such partnerships
would help in spreading the costs in terms of provision of knowledge and costs
of research. This paper discusses the various types of partnerships involving
industries and universities, the benefits derived and a possible model for the
working of such a partnership which could be adapted to other sectors and
countries in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Over the past couple of years, the extent of the services provided on the
mobile devices has increased rapidly. A special class of service among them is
the Location Based Service(LBS) which depends on the geographical position of
the user to provide services to the end users. However, a mobile device is
still resource constrained, and some applications usually demand more resources
than a mobile device can a ord. To alleviate this, a mobile device should get
resources from an external source. One of such sources is cloud computing
platforms. We can predict that the mobile area will take on a boom with the
advent of this new concept. The aim of this paper is to exchange messages
between user and location service provider in mobile device accessing the cloud
by minimizing cost, data storage and processing power. Our main goal is to
provide dynamic location-based service and increase the information retrieve
accuracy especially on the limited mobile screen by accessing cloud
application. In this paper we present location based restaurant information
retrieval system and we have developed our application in Android."
"With the exponentially increasing demand for wireless communications the
capacity of current cellular systems will soon become incapable of handling the
growing traffic. Since radio frequencies are diminishing natural resources,
there seems to be a fundamental barrier to further capacity increase. The
solution can be found by using smart antenna systems. Smart or adaptive antenna
arrays consist of an array of antenna elements with signal processing
capability that optimizes the radiation and reception of a desired signal,
dynamically. Smart antenna can place nulls in the direction of interferers via
adapting adaptive updating of weights linked to each antenna element. They thus
cancel out most of the cochannel interference resulting in better quality of
reception and lower dropped calls. Smart antenna can also track the user within
a cell via direction of arrival algorithms. This paper focuses on about the
smart antenna in hierarchical cell clustering (overlay-underlay) with demand
based frequency allocation techniques in cellular mobile radio networks in
INDIA."

"In highly competitive, globalized economies and societies of always-on-line
people intensively using the Internet and mobile phones, public administrations
have to adapt to new challenges. Enterprises and citizens expect public
administrations to be agile and pro-active to foster development. A way to
achieve agility and pro-activity is application of a model of Collaborative
Network Organizations in its two forms: Virtual Organizations (VO) and Virtual
Organization Breeding Environments (VOBE). In the paper, advantages are shown
of public administration playing a role of a Virtual Organization customer on
the one hand, and a Virtual Organization member on the other hand. It is also
shown how public administration playing a role of a Virtual Organization
Breeding Environment may improve its agility and promote advanced technologies
and management methods among local organizations. It is argued in the paper
that public administration should provide a Virtual Organization Breeding
Environment as a part of public services."
"Virtual Worlds (VWs) are an emerging technology used by a growing number of
educational institutions around the world. It is an environment, a way of
learning and an educational tool that allows different levels of online
interaction. In the course ""Programming I"", of the career Informatics

with the VW of Second Life, in order to evaluate the potential of using VWs in
the teaching practice."
"Past studies show that only a small percent of organizations implement and
enforce formal rules or informal guidelines for the designing, testing,
documenting, using, modifying, sharing and archiving of spreadsheet models. Due
to lack of such policies, there has been little research on how companies can
effectively govern spreadsheets throughout their life cycle. This paper
describes a survey involving 38 participants from the United States,
representing companies that were working on compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (SOX) as it relates to spreadsheets for financial reporting. The
findings of this survey describe specific controls organizations have
implemented to manage spreadsheets for financial reporting throughout the
spreadsheet's lifecycle. Our findings indicate that there are problems in all
stages of a spreadsheet's life cycle and suggest several important areas for
future research."
"Many, but not all, Indian CS & IT academics tend to have a focus on theory
and research. They do not give much importance to the practice of software
development. This paper proposes an additional software development career
track for Indian CS & IT academics different from the existing research
oriented career track. A measure of software contribution record is suggested.
It opines that adoption of such changes to academic regulations will result in
significant improvement of software development skill set in Indian CS & IT
academia which, in turn, will result in better software development skill set
in Indian CS & IT graduates."
"The vigorous impact of the Web in time and space arises from the fact that it
motivates massive creation, editing and distribution of information by Users
with little knowledge. This unprecedented continuum provides novel
opportunities for innovation but also puts under jeopardy its survival as a
stable construct that nurtures a complex system of connections. We examine the
Web as an ethics determined space by demonstrating Hayek's theory of freedom in
a three-leveled Web: technological, contextualized and economic. Our approach
accounts for the co-dependence of code and values, and assumes that the Web is
a self-contained system that exists in and by itself. This view of internal Web
ethics directly connects the concept of freedom with issues like centralization
of traffic and data control, rights on visiting log file, custom User profiles
and the interplay among function, structure and morality of the Web. It is also
demonstrated, in the case of Net Neutrality, that generic freedom-coercion
trade-offs are incomplete in treating specific cases at work."
"While the Internet was conceived as a decentralized network, the most widely
used web applications today tend toward centralization. Control increasingly
rests with centralized service providers who, as a consequence, have also
amassed unprecedented amounts of data about the behaviors and personalities of
individuals.
  Developers, regulators, and consumer advocates have looked to alternative
decentralized architectures as the natural response to threats posed by these
centralized services. The result has been a great variety of solutions that
include personal data stores (PDS), infomediaries, Vendor Relationship
Management (VRM) systems, and federated and distributed social networks. And
yet, for all these efforts, decentralized personal data architectures have seen
little adoption.
  This position paper attempts to account for these failures, challenging the
accepted wisdom in the web community on the feasibility and desirability of
these approaches. We start with a historical discussion of the development of
various categories of decentralized personal data architectures. Then we survey
the main ideas to illustrate the common themes among these efforts. We tease
apart the design characteristics of these systems from the social values that
they (are intended to) promote. We use this understanding to point out numerous
drawbacks of the decentralization paradigm, some inherent and others
incidental. We end with recommendations for designers of these systems for
working towards goals that are achievable, but perhaps more limited in scope
and ambition."
"In the Romanian penitentiary establishments and those of other European
countries one talks about the formal and informal education. Since the

"Computer technology and data processing swept both society and the sciences
like a wave in the latter half of the 20th century. We trace the AAVSO's usage
of computational and data processing technology from its beginnings in 1967,
through 1997. We focus on equipment, people, and the purpose such computational
power was put to, and compare and contrast the organization's use of hardware
and software with that of the wider industry."
"We have conducted an empirical investigation into the long term survival
rates of some small but representative samples of the 30,000 largest UK limited
companies. These companies were either a control or known to have used, or been
interested in the use of, spreadsheets, spreadsheet based monte carlo
simulation software, other spreadsheet and decision analysis software and/or
related management training. We show that there is a material and statistically
significant increase in the long term survival rate of all of these groups of
companies compared to the control."
"The use of computer-based mathematics tools is widespread in learning.
Depending on the way that these tools assess the learner's solution paths, one
can distinguish between automatic assessment tools and semi-automatic
assessment tools. Automatic assessment tools directly provide all feedback
necessary to the learners, while semi-automatic assessment tools involve the
teachers as part the assessment process. They are provided with as much
information as possible on the learners' interactions with the tool.
  How can the teachers know how the learning tools were used and which
intermediate steps led to a solution? How can the teachers respond to a
learner's question that arises while using a computer tool? Little is available
to answer this beyond interacting directly with the computer and performing a
few manipulations to understand the tools' state.
  This paper presents SMALA, a web-based logging architecture that addresses
these problems by recording, analyzing and representing user actions. While
respecting the learner's privacy, the SMALA architecture supports the teachers
by offering fine-grained representations of the learners' activities as well as
overviews of the progress of a classroom."

number of barriers to successful e-banking, including less reliable
telecommunications infrastructure and power supplies, less access to online
payment mechanisms, and relatively high costs for personal computers and
Internet access. How should managers in charge of e-banking prepare for global
implementation? What can they do reach consumers in developing countries? What
factors influence the adoption of consumer-oriented e-banking in various
countries? This research paper will give you the idea on the local conditions

"Information systems have always been in a prime focus in organizations in
both local (Pakistani) and global environment. Now the race of being the best
through Information Systems has created its importance in public sector
organizations to meet the global challenges. Public sector organizations have
been facing problems in different segments of technology adoption especially in
ERP projects. ERP adoption/implementation projects in public sector
organizations still encounter major setbacks in terms of partly/completely
success/failure. Cultural and other social barriers have been resistant in
technology adoption in Pakistan. Now in the case of big ERP adoptions the
contextual factors must be identified and addressed. The paper investigates the
reasons of success or failure by addressing nature of complexities regarding
different contextual factors. The study includes a sample of Pakistan s four
public sector organizations. The sample of this four organizations includes two
organizations (Type-A) i.e. Oil & Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and
National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) where ERP has been
successfully implemented and other two (Type-B) i.e. Pakistan Telecommunication
Corporation Limited (PTCL), Higher Education Commission (HEC) where ERP
implementation is in progress. The findings address the contextual factors i.e.
cultural, environmental & political changes which have a variable impact on ERP
systems adoption/implementation in addition to Business Process Re-engineering
(BPR). Paper also briefly includes analysis of gaps between pre & post ERP
implementation scenarios."
"Public sector organizations are treated in a different manner, as Information
technology/information system has become necessity in a highly competitive
environment. Importance of information systems is becoming more and more vital
as the global technology adoption is in progress. ERP projects are considered
as one of the most important and critical area of technology especially in
public sector organizations where cost effectiveness and operational efficiency
is prioritized on profits. A lot of research studies have been made on ERP
projects but mostly on critical success factors (CSFs) and other managerial
issues. This ongoing research mainly focuses upon the performance of ERP
software in public sector organizations by thoroughly going through one of the
largest most public sector organizations of Pakistan. Though ERP projects are
handled by experienced consultants in addition to the support of vendor
companies but because of its features and functional complexity and mismatch
with the organizational processes, different managerial and technical issues
arise during and after its implementation. This study investigates the
performance of ERP system in a large public sector organization of Pakistan;
five most critical technical factors, which can lead the whole project towards
success or failure, have been dug out. This exploratory study i.e. extensive
literature review and a case study includes survey and interviews which later
on investigated through their application in a public sector organization in
Pakistan."
"Healthcare organization is implementing Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) as a strategy for managing interactions with patients involving
technology to organize, automate, and coordinate business processes. Web-based
CRM provides healthcare organization with the ability to broaden service beyond
its usual practices in achieving a complex patient care goal, and this paper
discusses and demonstrates how a new approach in CRM based on Web 2.0 or Social
CRM helps healthcare organizations to improve their customer support, and at
the same time avoiding possible conflicts, and promoting better healthcare to
patients. A conceptual framework of the new approach will be proposed and
highlighted. The framework includes some important features of Social CRM such
as customer's empowerment, social interactivity between healthcare
organization-patients, and patients-patients. The framework offers new
perspective in building relationships between healthcare organizations and
customers and among customers in e-health scenario. It is developed based on
the latest development of CRM literatures and case studies analysis. In
addition, customer service paradigm in social network's era, the important of
online health education, and empowerment in healthcare organization will be
taken into consideration."
"Problem statement: Although, literature proves the importance of the
technology role in the effectiveness of virtual Research and Development (R&D)
teams for new product development. However, the factors that make technology
construct in a virtual R&D team are still ambiguous. The manager of virtual R&D
teams for new product development does not know which type of technology should
be used. Approach: To address the gap and answer the question, the study
presents a set of factors that make a technology construct. The proposed
construct modified by finding of the field survey (N = 240). We empirically
examine the relationship between construct and its factors by employing the
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). A measurement model built base on the 19
preliminary factors that extracted from literature review. The result shows 10
factors out of 19 factors maintaining to make technology construct. Results:
These 10 technology factors can be grouped into two constructs namely Web base
communication and Web base data sharing. The findings can help new product
development managers of enterprises to concentrate in the main factors for
leading an effective virtual R&D team. In addition, it provides a guideline for
software developers as well. Conclusion: The second and third generation
technologies are now more suitable for developing new products through virtual
R&D teams."
"Using data from the Web of Science (WoS), we analyze the mutual information
among university, industrial, and governmental addresses (U-I-G) at the country
level for a number of countries. The dynamic evolution of the Triple Helix can
thus be compared among developed and developing nations in terms of
cross-sectorial co-authorship relations. The results show that the Triple-Helix
interactions among the three subsystems U-I-G become less intensive over time,
but unequally for different countries. We suggest that globalization erodes
local Triple-Helix relations and thus can be expected to increase
differentiation in national systems since the mid-1990s. This effect of
globalization is more pronounced in developed countries than in developing
ones. In the dynamic analysis, we focus on a more detailed comparison between
China and the USA. The Chinese Academy of the (Social) Sciences changes
increasingly from a public research institute to an academic one, and this has
a measurable effect on China's position in the globalization."
"Internet banking is changing the banking industry, having the major effects
on banking relationships. Banking is now no longer confined to the branches
were one has to approach the branch in person, to withdraw cash or deposit a
cheque or request a statement of accounts. In true Internet banking, any
inquiry or transaction is processed online without any reference to the branch
(anywhere banking) at any time. Providing Internet banking is increasingly
becoming a ""need to have"" than a ""nice to have"" service. The net banking, thus,
now is more of a norm rather than an exception in many developed countries due
to the fact that it is the cheapest way of providing banking services. This
research paper will introduce you to e-banking, giving the meaning, functions,
types, advantages and limitations of e-banking. It will also show the impact of
e-banking on traditional services and finally the result documentation."

"Modern ways of communications, such as in a web services environment, also
influences trust relationships between organisations. This concept of web-based
(way towards semantic web services) trust is new and has as yet not been
resolved. We hope that some of the trust properties mentioned above can be
successfully employed to improve the understanding of trust between machines.
So, trust is a vital ingredient of any successful interaction between
individuals, among organizations and/or in society at large. In this paper, we
suggested a trust model using fuzzy logic in semantic network of nodes. Trust
is an aggregation of consensus given a set of past interaction among nodes
(semantic network based on machines, agents etc.). We applied our suggested
model to semantic networks in order to show how trust mechanisms are involved
in communicating algorithm to choose the proper path from source to
destination. Authors use the terms untrust and distrust as synonyms for the
condition opposite to the trust."
"An appcessory (app + accessory) is a smart phone accessory that is combined
with a specially written app to perform a useful function. An example is a toy
helicopter controlled by a smart phone app: the full value proposition involves
both new hardware outside the phone and new software running inside the phone.
Like the smart phone itself and like a PC, the appcessory hardware is a
platform: it has the property that it becomes even more valuable if innovative
new software is written for it. It is technically possible that innovation in
the appcessory space becomes loosely coupled, with different parties
specializing to innovate on either the hardware (accessory) side or the
software (app) side. However, we are not seeing this loose coupling yet in the
current market. We argue that the reason for this is economical: a market

"We investigate how the students think of their experience in a junior 300
level computer science course that uses blackboard as the underlying course
management system. The discussion boards in Blackboard are heavily used for
programming project support and to foster cooperation among students to answer
their questions and concerns. A survey is conducted through blackboard as a
voluntary quiz and the student who participated were given a participation
point for their effort. The results and the participation were very
interesting. We obtained statistics from the answers to the questions. The
students also have given us feedback in the form of comments to all questions
except for two only. The students have shown understanding, maturity and
willingness to participate in pedagogy-enhancing endeavors with the premise
that it might help their education and other people education as well."
"The large numbers of sick children in different diseases are very dreaded,
and when there isn't succor at the proper time and in the type the sick child
need it that makes us lose child. This paper suggested an emergency system for
succoring sick child locally when he required that, and there isn't someone
knows his disease. The proposed system is the first tracking system works
online (24 hour in the day) but only when the sick children requiring the help
using mobile GIS. In, this emergency system the child will send SMS (for easy
he click one button) contains his ID and coordinates (Longitude and Latitude)
via GPRS network to the web server (the child was registered previously on that
server), in this step the server will locate the sick child on Google map and
retrieve the child's information from the database which saved this information
in registration stage, and base on these information will send succoring
facility and at the same time informing the hospital, his parents, doctor, etc.
about that emergency case of the child using the SMS mode through GPRS network
again. The design and implement of the proposed system shows more effective
cost than other systems because it used a minimum configuration (hardware and
software) and works in economic mode.

"Background: Researchers in developing countries often do not have access to
training on research writing. The purpose of this study was to test whether
researchers in Rwanda might complete and benefit from a pilot online course in
research writing. Methods: The pilot course was set up on Moodle, an
open-source online learning environment, and facilitated by the author. The
lessons and assignment were spread over six weeks, followed by a two-week
extension period. Twenty-eight faculty members of the National University of
Rwanda enrolled themselves in the course. Results: Twenty-five of the 28
learners completed the course. After the course, these learners expressed high
satisfaction, e.g, 24 of them felt that they were ready to write a research
paper for publication. Conclusion: The high completion rate (89%) is noteworthy
for two reasons: e-learning courses tend to have lower completion rates than
classroom courses, and 76% of the learners in the pilot course had not taken an
e-learning course before. This result and the positive feedback indicate that
online courses can benefit researchers in developing countries who may not have
access to classroom courses on research writing."
"We are seeing more and more organizations undertaking activities to engage
dispersed populations through IS. Using the knowledge-based view of the
organization, this work conceptualizes a theory of Crowd Capital to explain
this phenomenon. Crowd Capital is a heterogeneous knowledge resource generated
by an organization, through its use of Crowd Capability, which is defined by
the structure, content, and process by which an organization engages with the
dispersed knowledge of individuals (the Crowd). Our work draws upon a diverse
literature and builds upon numerous examples of practitioner implementations to
support our theorizing. We present a model of Crowd Capital generation in
organizations and discuss the implications of Crowd Capital on organizational
boundary and on IS research."
"Latest study shows that MCL is highly focusing paradigm for research
particularity in distance and online education. MCL provides some features and
functionalities for all participants to obtain the knowledge. Deployment of new
emerging technologies and fast growing trends toward MCL boom attract people to
develop learning management system, virtual learning environment and conference
system with support of MCL. All these environments lack the most promising
supportive framework. In addition some of major challenges in open, large
scale, dynamic and heterogeneous environments are not still handled in
developing MCL for education and other organizations. These issues includes
such as knowledge sharing, faster delivery of contents, request for modified
contents, complete access to enterprise data warehouse, delivery of large rich
multimedia contents (video-on-demand), asynchronous collaboration, synchronous
collaboration, support for multi model, provision for archive updating, user
friendly interface, middleware support and virtual support. To overcome these
issues; the paper introduces novel framework for MCL consisting of four layers
with many promising functional components, which provide access to users for
obtaining required contents from enterprise data warehouse (EDW). Novel
framework provides information regarding the course materials, easy access to
check the grades and use of labs. The applications running on this framework
give substantial feedback for collaboration such as exchange for delivery of
communication contents including platform for group discussion, short message
service (SMS), emails, audio, video and video-on-demand to obtain on-line

"Based on the complete set of firm data for Sweden (N = 1,187,421; November
2011), we analyze the mutual information among the geographical, technological,
and organizational distributions in terms of synergies at regional and national
levels. Mutual information in three dimensions can become negative and thus
indicate a net export of uncertainty by a system or, in other words, synergy in
how knowledge functions are distributed over the carriers. Aggregation at the
regional level (NUTS3) of the data organized at the municipal level (NUTS5)
shows that 48.5% of the regional synergy is provided by the three metropolitan
regions of Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malm\""o/Lund. Sweden can be considered as
a centralized and hierarchically organized system. Our results accord with
other statistics, but this Triple Helix indicator measures synergy more
specifically and quantitatively. The analysis also provides us with validation
for using this measure in previous studies of more regionalized systems of
innovation (such as Hungary and Norway)."
"The design requirement for flight visual simulation system is studied and the
overall structure and development process are proposed in this paper. Through
the construction of 3D scene model library and aircraft model, the rendering
and interaction of visual scene are implemented. The changes of aircraft flight
attitude in visual system are controlled by real-time calculation of aircraft
aerodynamic and dynamic equations and flight simulation effect is enhanced by
this kind of control. Several key techniques for optimizing 3D model and
relative methods for large terrain modeling are explored for improving loading
ability and rendering speed of the system. Experiment shows that, with specific
function and performance guaranteed as a premise, the system achieves expected
results, that is, precise real-time calculation of flight attitude and smooth
realistic screen effect."

"The continuous growth of electronic commerce has stimulated great interest in
studying online consumer behavior. Given the significant growth in online
shopping, better understanding of customers allows better marketing strategies
to be designed. While studies of online shopping attitude are widespread in the
literature, studies of browsing habits differences in relation to online
shopping are scarce.
  This research performs a large scale study of the relationship between
Internet browsing habits of users and their online shopping behavior. Towards
this end, we analyze data of 88,637 users who have bought more in total half a
milion products from the retailer sites Amazon and Walmart. Our results
indicate that even coarse-grained Internet browsing behavior has predictive
power in terms of what users will buy online. Furthermore, we discover both
surprising (e.g., ""expensive products do not come with more effort in terms of
purchase"") and expected (e.g., ""the more loyal a user is to an online shop, the
less effort they spend shopping"") facts.
  Given the lack of large-scale studies linking online browsing and online
shopping behavior, we believe that this work is of general interest to people
working in related areas."
"Usually the first course in mathematics is calculus. Its a core course in the
curriculum of the Business, Engineering and the Sciences. However many students
face difficulties to learn calculus. These difficulties are often caused by the
prior fear of mathematics. The students today cant live without using computer
technology. The uses of computer for teaching and learning can transform the
boring traditional methodology of teach to more active and attractive method.
In this paper, we will show how we can use Excel in teaching calculus to
improve our students learning and understanding through different types of
applications ranging from Business to Engineering. The effectiveness of the
proposed methodology was tested on a random sample of 45 students from
different majors over a period of two semesters."
"For the realization of the vision and mission of Healthy Indonesia 2015, we
need a health service with a broad and comprehensive scope.To provide health
services, it can be realized by creating an integrated information system
applications such as creating an electronic medical record that has the ability
to process and store patient medical data. The specifications used medical
record is an open specification contained in OpenEHR that includes information
and service model for electronic medical records, demographics, and the
archetype which allows software developers taking the logical structure as a
universal functional interface, so it can facilitate the process of information
by the recipient. It is because of using the interface with
appropriate-purposed data presentation and data on computer screen of the same
users. The purpose of this paper is to create an electronic website for the
medical record by using OpenEHR specifications for easy accessing, processing
and storing the medical records by the actors that play a role in the data
processing of medical records. With this application it is expected to be
useful for data processing and health information gathering, thus to improve
the quality of services that will impact the improved performance of the

"Knowing that an enterprise is a complex reality, it is necessary to develop a
modeling framework allowing the description of system structure and dynamics
that alter the structure. The concept of enterprise modeling addresses this
need and many techniques have emerged. Our goal is to provide leaders of
Algerian enterprise an overview of modeling techniques. Thus these managers may
elect, in collaboration with the University, the modeling technique best suited
to their requirements. TWe believe that this could be a step towards an
effective reorganization of the enterprise leading. TThis article proposes a
domain ontology and multi-criteria analysis in the frame of modeling
enterprise. Our approach is based on two stages using the Prot\'eg\'e tool for
the technique representation and the PROMETHEE method for their evaluation. The
result is a ranking between the different techniques, which allows selecting
the most appropriate methodology according to the criteria for a given

"The IS-Impact Measurement Model, developed by Gable, Sedera and Chan in 2008,
represents the to-date and expected stream of net profits from a given
information system (IS), as perceived by all major user classes. Although this
model has been stringently validated in previous studies, its generalizability
and verified effectiveness are enhanced through this new application in
e-learning. This paper focuses on the re-validation of the findings of the
IS-Impact Model in two universities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Among
the users of 2 universities e-learning systems, 528 students were recruited. A
formative validation measurement with SmartPLS, a graphical structural equation
modeling tool was used to analyse the collected data. On the basis of the
SmartPLS results, as well as with the aid of data-supported IS impact
measurements and dimensions, we confirmed the validity of the IS-Impact Model
for assessing the effect of e-learning systems in KSA universities. The newly
constructed model is more understandable, its use was proved as robust and
applicable to various circumstances."

"Using techniques of data collection and mapping as overlays to Google
Maps--on the basis of patent information available online at the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO)--we point at two major and interconnected
challenges that policy-makers face in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) when
combating the lagging innovation performance. First, we address the spatial
concentration by using a distribution analysis at the city level. The results
suggest that patenting is concentrated in post-socialist territories more than
in western nations and regions. However, there is not a single outstanding hub
in CEE when one compares USPTO patents normalized for the respective population
sizes. Secondly, we argue that dominance of foreign control over USPTO patents
is mostly embodied in international co-operations at the individual level, and
only rarely spilled-over to MNE subsidiaries. In our opinion, catching-up of
CEE in terms of patenting is unlikely, unless innovation policy measures focus
on growing hubs and target both domestic inventors and international relations
of companies."

"This study introduces a structured analysis of science parks as arenas
designed to stimulate institutional collaboration and the commercialization of
academic knowledge and technology, and the promotion of social welfare. A
framework for key actors and their potential behaviour in this context is
introduced based on the Triple Helix (TH) model and related literature. A link
analysis was conducted to build an inter-linking network that may map the
infrastructure support network through the online interactions of the
organisations involved in York Science Park. A comparison between the framework
and the diagram shows that the framework can be used to identify most of the
actors and assess their interconnections. The web patterns found correspond to
previous evaluations based on traditional indicators and suggest that the
network, which is developed to foster and support innovation, arises from the
functional cooperation between the University of York and regional authorities,
which both serve as the major driving forces in the trilateral linkages and the
development of an innovation infrastructure."
"What would you teach if you had only one course to help students grasp the
essence of computation and perhaps inspire a few of them to make computing a
subject of further study? Assume they have the standard college prep
background. This would include basic algebra, but not necessarily more advanced
mathematics. They would have written a few term papers, but would not have
written computer programs. They could surf and twitter, but could not
exclusive-or and nand. What about computers would interest them or help them
place their experience in context? This paper provides one possible answer to
this question by discussing a course that has completed its second iteration.
Grounded in classical logic, elucidated in digital circuits and computer
software, it expands into areas such as CPU components and massive databases.
The course has succeeded in garnering the enthusiastic attention of students
with a broad range of interests, exercising their problem solving skills, and
introducing them to computational thinking."
"Human mobility analysis is an important issue in social sciences, and
mobility data are among the most sought-after sources of information in ur-
Data ban studies, geography, transportation and territory management. In
network sciences mobility studies have become popular in the past few years,
especially using mobile phone location data. For preserving the customer
privacy, datasets furnished by telecom operators are anonymized. At the same
time, the large size of datasets often makes the task of calculating all
observed trajectories very difficult and time-consuming. One solution could be
to sample users. However, the fact of not having information about the mobile
user makes the sampling delicate. Some researchers select randomly a sample of
users from their dataset. Others try to optimize this method, for example,
taking into account only users with a certain number or frequency of locations
recorded. At the first glance, the second choice seems to be more efficient:
having more individual traces makes the analysis more precise. However, the
most frequently used CDR data (Call Detail Records) have location generated
only at the moment of communication (call, SMS, data connection). Due to this
fact, users mobility patterns cannot be precisely built upon their
communication patterns. Hence, these data have evident short-comings both in
terms of spatial and temporal scale. In this paper we propose to estimate the
correlation between the users communication and mo- bility in order to better
assess the bias of frequency based sampling. Using technical GSM network data
(including communication but also independent mobility records), we will
analyze the relationship between communication and mobility patterns."
"While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends in the
Internet usage have witnessed an increasing number of people sharing their
email passwords for both personal and professional purposes. As sharing
passwords increases the chances of your passwords being compromised, leading
websites like Google strongly advise their users not to share their passwords
with anyone. To cater to this conflict of usability versus security and
privacy, we introduce ChaMAILeon, an experimental service, which allows users
to share their email passwords while maintaining their privacy and not
compromising their security. In this report, we discuss the technical details
of the implementation of ChaMAILeon."

to produce highly skilled patent attorneys and agents, to overcome the problem
of poor quality of patents, and the high number of patent related litigations.
A framework is suggested which would enable STEM departments and law schools to
successfully offer this integrated degree, and students to successfully pursue
and complete this degree program in a realistic manner; without compromising

"In this paper, an intelligent system for web based e-Learning is proposed
which analyzes students knowledge capacity by applying clustering technique.
This system uses fuzzy logic and k-means clustering algorithm to arrange the
documents according to the level of their performance. Moreover, a new domain

the knowledge sources from the e-Learning domain for effective decision making.
The proposed ontology alignment method has been empirically tested in an
e-Learning environment and the experimental results show that the proposed
method performs better than the existing methods in terms of precision and
recall. The salient contributions of this paper are the use of Jaccard
Similarity, fuzzy approach for ontology alignment and K-Means clustering
algorithm for decision making using decision rules for providing intelligent

"eHealth has expanded hugely over the last fifteen years and continues to
evolve, providing greater benefits for patients, health care professionals and
providers alike. The technologies that support these systems have become
increasingly more sophisticated and have progressed significantly from standard
databases, used for patient records, to highly advanced Virtual Reality (VR)
systems for the treatment of complex mental health illnesses. The scope of this
paper is to initially explore e-Health, particularly in relation to
technologies supporting the treatment and management of wellbeing in mental
health. It then provides a case study of how technology in e-Health can lend
itself to an application that could support and maintain the wellbeing of
people with a severe mental illness. The case study uses Borderline Personality
Disorder as an example, but could be applicable in many other areas, including
depression, anxiety, addiction and PTSD. This type of application demonstrates
how e-Health can empower the individuals using it but also potentially reducing
the impact upon health care providers and services."
"In B2C Online services contexts where relationships between customers and
service providers matter due to the lack of faceto- face interactions,
uncertainty, intangibility, hyper competition, increasing risk of fraud and
lack of trust. Relationship quality (RQ) is replacing service quality as a key
source of superior performance and competitive advantage. Accordingly, this
study investigates the dimensions of relationship quality from e-Banking
services and explores the differences among customers of Jordanian and foreign
banks. Many of the foreign banks in Jordan are equipped with large financial
capital, having high banking and financial experiences and are offering many
modern hi-tech banking services. This situation makes Jordanian banks in front
of unprecedented competition and so they have invested heavily to develop their
e-banking services, in order to strengthening their relationships with existing
customers, enhancing their trust, letting them satisfied, ensuring their
commitment and attracting of new ones. This paper aims to identify the key
dimensions that shape the relationship quality among Jordanian and foreign
banks and their customers who are utilizing the e-Banking services. Based on an
extensive review of relevant literature, we have formulated nine hypotheses and
identified three factors (satisfaction, trust, and commitment) that may affect
the competitiveness and success of Jordanian and foreign banks. Survey data
from 350 customers from four Jordanian banks and four foreign banks in Amman
city the capital of Jordan were collected and used to test the proposed
hypotheses. Based on the structural equation modeling and Ttest analyses, our
empirical analysis demonstrates several key findings."

"Regarding the rapid growth of the size and complexity of simulation
applications, designing applicable and affordable verification and validation
(V&V) structures is an important problem. On the other hand, nowadays human
behavior models are principles to make decision in many simulations and in
order to have valid decisions based on a reliable human decision model, first
the model must pass the validation and verification criteria. Usually human
behavior models are represented as fuzzy rule bases. In all the recent works,
V&V process is applied on a ready given rule-base. In this work, we are first
supposed to construct a fuzzy rule-base and then apply the V&V process on it.
Considering the professor-student interaction as the case-study, in order to
construct the rule base, a questionnaire is designed in a special way to be
transformed to a hierarchical fuzzy rule-base. The constructed fuzzy rule base
is then mapped to a fuzzy Petri net and then within the verification
(generating and searching the reachability graph) and validation (reasoning the
Petri net) process is searched for probable structural and semantic errors."
"Electronic businesses are witnessing enormous growth as more and more people

recommendations are made to harmonize IT and Internet Laws. A novel approach is
proposed to promote legal risk management culture in organizations. It begins
with revising current state of regulations surrounding eBusinesses and

"The use of automation in digital forensic investigations is not only a
technological issue, but also has political and social implications. This work
discusses some challenges with the implementation and acceptance of automation
in digital forensic investigation, and possible implications for current
digital forensic investigators. Current attitudes towards the use of automation
in digital forensic investigations are examined, as well as the issue of
digital investigators knowledge acquisition and retention. The argument is made
for a well planned, careful use of automation going forward that allows for a
more efficient and effective use of automation in digital forensic
investigations while at the same time attempting to improve the overall quality
of expert investigators. Targeting and carefully controlling automated
solutions for beginning investigators may improve the speed and quality of
investigations while at the same time letting expert digital investigators
spend more time utilizing expert level knowledge required in manual phases of
investigations. By considering how automated solutions are being implemented
into digital investigations, investigation unit managers can increase the
efficiency of their unit while at the same time maximizing their return on
investment for expert level digital investigator training."
"Studying design creativity and innovation from practical perspectives for
companies requires both a good understanding of the company ecosystem and its
inner processes contributing to delivered innovations and a rigorous design
research methodology to provide effective design models, methods, platforms

Engineering laboratory, we advocate a more systemic vision of design creativity
and innovation in company ecosystems. We present in this paper an attempt to
develop and make professional an innovation engineering. Our research works are
illustrated along the different research topics of an innovation process. We
start by a recent survey on innovation practice and organizational models led
in 28 large companies. The lessons learned about this survey reinforce our
belief that there is a need for a new method in agile management of radical
innovation projects in company contexts. We currently develop, test and apply
such a methodology named: Radical Innovation Design(RID). Its effectiveness has
been evaluated through a large scale evaluation of the project outcomes for the
company. Two extensions of RID have been proposed and deployed in company
contexts: a selection procedure for innovation clusters and a value-driven
process for airplane development projects."
"As Internet is changing from network of data into network of functionalities,
a federated Internet of applications, that every application can cooperate with
each other smoothly, is a natural trending topic. However, existing integration
techniques did not pay enough attention to multiple control domains for
participants, i.e. application providers and end-users. In this study, we
advocate a global cooperation model for all the participants counts. In
particular, we propose a hybrid model to manage the cooperation among
applications to achieve more optimized allocation of efforts, which means users
perform lighter actions and application providers concerning less
uncontrollable information. In addition, we implement the required system and
show a case study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this model."
"Data collection is a key component of an information system. The widespread
penetration of ICT tools in organizations and institutions has resulted in a
shift in the way the data is collected. Data may be collected in printed-form,
by e-mails, on a compact disk, or, by direct upload on the management
information system. Since web services are platform-independent, it can access
data stored in the XML format from any platform. In this paper, we present an
interface which uses web services for data collection. It requires interaction
between a web service deployed for the purposes of data collection, and the web
address where the data is stored. Our interface requires that the web service
has pre-knowledge of the address from where the data is to be collected. Also,
the data to be accessed must be stored in XML format. Since our interface uses
computer-supported interaction on both sides, it eases the task of regular and
ongoing data collection. We apply our framework to the Education Management
Information System, which collects data from schools spread across the country."

"Fire keeps claiming a large number of victims in building fires. Although
there are ways to minimize such events, fire drills are used to train the
building occupants for emergency situations. However, organizing and implement
these exercises is a complex task, and sometimes not sucessfull. Furthermore,
fire drills require the mobilization of some finantial resources and time, and
affect the normal functioning of the site where they occur. To overcome the
aforementioned issues, computer games have a set of features that might
overcome this problem. They offer engagement to their players, keeping them
focused, and providing training to real life situations. The game evaluate
users, providing them some feedback, making possible for the players to improve
their performance. The proposed methodology aims to study the viability of
using a game that recreates a fire drill in a 3D environment using Serious
Games. The information acquired through the player's performance is very
valuable and will be later used to implement an artificial population. A sample
of 20 subjects was selected to test the application. Preliminary results are
promising, showing that the exercise had a positive impact on users. Moreover,
the data acquired is of great important and will be later used to demonstrate
the possibility of creating an artificial population based on human behaviour."
"E-government services aims to provide citizens with more accessible,
accurate, real-time and high quality services and information. Although the
public sectors in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have promoted their
e-Government services for many years, its uses and achievements are few.
Therefore, this paper explores the key factors of Saudi citizens acceptance
through a research survey and by gathering empirical evidence based on the
Unified Theory of Acceptance and the Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey Data
collected from 400 respondents was examined using structural equation modelling
(SEM) technique and utilized AMOS tools. The study results explored the factors
that affect the acceptance of e-government services in KSA based on UTAUT
model. Moreover, as a result of this study an amended UTAUT model was proposed.
Such a model contributes to the discussion and development of adoption models
for technology."
"Todays, Intelligent and web-based E-Learning is one of the important area in
E-Learning. This paper integrates an intelligent and web-based E-Learning with
expert system technology to be able to model the learning styles of the
learners using Jackson's model. It is intelligent because it can interact with
the learners and offer them some subjects in Pedagogy view. Learning process of
this system is in the following. First it determines learner's individual
characteristics and learning styles based on a questionnaire in Jackson's
learning styles profiler. Learning styles profiler is a modern measure of
individual differences in learning style. Then learner's model is obtained and
an Expert system simulator plans a ""pre-test"" and rates him. The concept would
be presented if the learner scores enough. Subsequently, the system evaluates
him by a ""post-test"". Finally the learner's model would be updated by the
modeler based on try-and-error. The proposed system can be available Every Time
and Every Where (ETEW) through the web. It improves the learning performance
and has some important advantages such as high speed, simplicity of learning,
low cost and be available ETEW."
"Nowadays, with the rapid growth of cloud computing, many industries are going
to move their computing activities to clouds. Researchers of virtual learning
are also looking for the ways to use clouds through mobile platforms. This
paper offers a model to accompany the benefits of ""Mobile Intelligent Learning""
technology and ""Cloud Computing"". The architecture of purposed system is based
on multi-layer architecture of Mobile Cloud Computing. Despite the existing
challenges, the system has increased the life of mobile device battery. It will
raise working memory capacity and processing capacity of the educational system
in addition to the greater advantage of the educational system. The proposed
system allows the users to enjoy an intelligent learning every-time and
every-where, reduces training costs and hardware dependency, and increases
consistency, efficiency, and data reliability."
"Todays, Intelligent and web-based E-learning is one of regarded topics. So
researchers are trying to optimize and expand its application in the field of
education. The aim of this paper is developing of E-learning software which is
customizable, dynamic, intelligent and adaptive with Pedagogy view for learners
in intelligent schools. This system is an integration of adaptive web-based
E-learning with expert systems as well. Learning process in this system is as
follows. First intelligent tutor determines learning style and characteristics
of learner by a questionnaire and then makes his model. After that the expert
system simulator plans a pre-test and then calculates his score. If the learner
gets the required score, the concept will be trained. Finally the learner will
be evaluated by a post-test. The proposed system can improves the education
efficiency highly as well as de-creases the costs and problems of an expert
tutor. As a result, every time and eve-rywhere (ETEW) learning would be
provided via web in this system. Moreover the learners can enjoy a cheap remote
learning even at home in a virtual simulated physical class. So they can learn
thousands courses very simple and fast."
"Nowadays, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are so regarded in order to
improve education quality via new technologies in this area. One of the
problems is that the language of ITSs is different from the learner's. It
forces the learners to learn the system language. This paper tries to remove
this necessity by using an Automatic Translator Component in system structure
like Google Translate API. This system carry out a pre-test and post-test by
using Expert System and Jackson Model before and after of training a concept.
It constantly updates learner model to save all changes in learning process. So
this paper offers an E-Learning system which is web-based, intelligent,
adaptive, multilingual and remotely accessible where tutors and learners can
have non-identical language. It is also applicable Every Time and Every Where
(ETEW). Furthermore, it trains the concepts in the best method with any
language and low cost."
"Mobile Learning (M-Learning) is an emerging discipline in the area of
education and educational technology. So researchers are trying to optimize and
expanding its application in the field of education. The aim of this paper is
to investigate the role of mobile devices and expert systems in disseminating
and supporting the knowledge gained by intelligent tutors and to propose a
system based on integration of intelligent M-Learning with expert systems. It
acts as an intelligent tutor which can perform three processes - pre-test,
learning concept and post-test - according to characteristic of the learner.
The proposed system can improves the education efficiency highly as well as
decreases costs. As a result, every time and everywhere (ETEW) simple and cheap
learning would be provided via SMS, MMS and so on in this system. The global
intention of M-Learning is to make learning ""a way of being""."
"Most recent e-health initiatives perceive customers (patients) as recipients
of medical care where they do not have a significant role in the process of
health decision making. However, the advancement of Web 2.0 offers patients to
have a greater role in the decision making process related to their health as
they can be empowered with the ability to access and control information that
fits with their personalized needs. However, providing patient empowerment in
e-health through Web 2.0 is challenging task because the complexity nature of
healthcare business processes. Empowerment closely relates to the concept of
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in managing good relationships with the
customers. The adoption of Web 2.0 in CRM systems is known as Social CRM or CRM
2.0. Social CRM emerges to accommodate dynamic means of interaction between
patients with their healthcare providers. The aim of this paper is to present a
model that embeds empowerment of patient through Social CRM intervention that
may extend the role of the patient as an individual health actor, a social
health agent, and a medical care partner. A survey has been conducted to gain a
feedback from customers regarding the proposed model. A prototype derived from
the model namely Clinic 2.0 has also been developed. Using the prototype we
measure its impact towards customer satisfaction and health literacy. The
results show that the system intervention through Clinic 2.0 improves the level
of satisfaction and health literacy of participants."
"Quality competence of worker the present do not meet labor market criteria
and the low level of labor productivity, the lack of communication between the
labor market with education, changing of socio-economic structure and global
political influence labor market, the development of science and technology
very rapidly lead to fundamental changes in terms of qualifications,
competencies and requirements for entering the workforce. Tracer Study results
can be used by universities to determine the success of the educational process

"We linked names and contact information to publicly available profiles in the
Personal Genome Project. These profiles contain medical and genomic
information, including details about medications, procedures and diseases, and
demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, and postal code. By
linking demographics to public records such as voter lists, and mining for
names hidden in attached documents, we correctly identified 84 to 97 percent of
the profiles for which we provided names. Our ability to learn their names is
based on their demographics, not their DNA, thereby revisiting an old
vulnerability that could be easily thwarted with minimal loss of research
value. So, we propose technical remedies for people to learn about their
demographics to make better decisions."
"We have long-term experience with developing and employing multimedia
materials for on-campus and distance education. We also are assessing the
efficacy of cooperative learning where groups of learners explore, with
guidance from an instructor, the learning environment and construct models of
meaning based on their shared learning experiences. Our core technologies
capture and store classroom events, but are record-and-playback technologies
focused on delivering content to individual learners. We describe an extension
of our technology, Cooperative Learning in MANIC (CLIMANIC), which allows
groups of learners and teachers to collaborate and communicate. We describe our
current assessment of CLIMANIC and future plans for more extensive evaluation."
"Computer models and information systems have been used for urban planning and
design since the 1950s. Their capacity for analysis and problem-solving has
increased substantially since then with hardware and software being able to
manage large amounts of data. The beginning of the 2000s brought better
technologies for data visualisation and intuitive software products and
nowadays they are being used to design and manipulate highly complex urban
systems. However, ontological and epistemological questions remain about the
nature of urban environments. What do we know about cities - and what is a city
exactly? What theoretical models can be applied to the study of cities? How do
we translate a city into data? What type of information really matters and what
do we want to communicate with them? What are the implications of computer
modelling for urban planning and design? This paper reviews how digital
technologies have been used to shape our understanding of cities and how they
impact the design and planning of cities. The point of depart is a scrutiny of
the emergence of modern planning in the nineteenth century when cities became a
scientific subject. A range of theories and concepts of the urban form and
urban growth developed during the twentieth century will be presented and then
linked to the first investigations involving the use of the computer for
modelling and planning. The paper concludes with some discussions around the
interaction of computing and urban theories."
"Depending on references of the World Health Organization there is large
numbers of sick persons with different diseases worldwide, and without succor
at a suitable time this could lead to fatality of the patients. This paper
offers a succoring system controlled by the patient based on the location of
patients. The proposed system is the first tracking system using mobile GIS
based on WCF technology to offer online succoring (24 hour a day), but really
works only when the patient sends request for succoring. The patients will send
a request (SMS by click one button) contains his ID, Longitude and Latitude via
GPRS network to a web server containing a database, which the patient was
registered previously on it. Then the server will locate the patient on Google
map and retrieve the patient's information from the database. This information
will be used by the server to send succoring facility and notify the nearest
and most suitable ESC; moreover, the server will send SMS over IP to inform the
patient emergency contacts and emergency hospital. The optimal productivity for
proposed succoring system appears in handling a large number of requests within
short period at rate of one request/need succoring per sec as result of using
mobile GIS based on WCF technology. Furthermore, the process of request and
reply for emergency cases of the patients achieved in costeffective way due to
this technology, which allow sending data (SMS over IP) via Internet using GPRS
network. The proposed system can be implemented in a minimum configuration
(hardware and software) to minimize the overall cost of operation and
manufacturing. Keywords- WCF; WPF; Build-in GPS; GPRS; Mobile GIS; SoIP;

"This paper presents data analysis from a course on Software Engineering in an
effort to identify metrics and techniques that would allow instructor to act
proactively and identify patterns of low engagement and inefficient peer
collaboration. Over the last two terms, 106 students in their second year of
studies formed 20 groups and worked collaboratively to develop video games.
Throughout the lab, students have to use a variety of tools for managing and
developing their projects, such as software version control, static analysis
tools, wikis, mailing lists, etc. The students are also supported by weekly
meetings with teaching assistants and instructors regarding group progress,
code quality, and management issues. Through these meetings and their
interactions with the software tools, students leave a detailed trace of data
related to their individual engagement and their collaboration behavior in
their groups. The paper provides discussion on the different source of data
that can be monitored, and present preliminary results on how these data can be
used to analyze students' activity."
"Whenever we think of cyber applications, we visualize the model that gives
the idea that we are sitting in front of computer at home or workplace
connected to internet and performing all the work that generally we have to go
and do on a specific place for example e-shopping, e-banking, e-education etc.
In case of e-shopping, we view all the products on the computer screen with all
details by a single mouse click, select the product and do all further money
transaction through net. When we think of security, is it 100% secure? No, not
at all because though it is password protected, the password is a text base
secrete code that can be open. Therefore this paper is concentrated on
preparation of speech based password protected applications."
"Education pierces into the contemporary world due to the influence of the
emerging technologies in the digital world. Education field is also bombarded
by the modern technologies and the demands of the digital society. It is
affected by cloud computing, green computing and Internet. Still the success of
this depends upon the minimization of the knowledge loss, while transferring
ideas from teacher to student. Teaching & Learning is always an art. Even
though modern technology is introduced along with the traditional method of
teaching in Higher College of Technology (HCT), knowledge loss is very high
still. Mnemonics is an old tool; still suitable for digital era students with
the influence of recent technologies. Hence this paper discusses how to
implement this mnemonics with the help of modern technologies like E-Learning
and M-Learning. In this paper we have tried to discuss about E-learning and
M-learning usage for implementing Mnemonics, and also discussed how far this
concept can be used to make the Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
more efficient and effective in term of making the students learning experience
as a fun and without huge knowledge loss during the teaching and learning
process including practical subjects. This paper also explains the initial
research conducted with the students of database specialization of HCT and
findings of that research about the knowledge loss. We have also suggests the
future research areas in Mnemonics."
"Education today is becoming completely associated with the Information
Technology on the content delivery, communication and collaboration. The need
for servers, storage and software are highly demanding in the universities,
colleges and schools. Cloud Computing is an Internet based computing, whereby
shared resources, software and information, are provided to computers and
devices on-demand, like the electricity grid. Currently, IaaS (Infrastructure
as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service)
are used as business model for Cloud Computing. The paper also introduces the
cloud computing infrastructure provided by Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web

"As the number of online shopping websites increases day by day, so are the
online advertisement strategies and promotional techniques. The number of
people who uses internet keeps on increasing daily and it has become a vast
marketplace to promote products, surely it will be a prime reason to drive any
companies growth in the future.This paper primarily focuses on the areas on
which online shopping lags product promotion and customer retention. Sellers
must concentrate on the areas in which online marketing lags product promotion
techniques; also they should introduce new strategies to increase their market
share to gain customers attention towards their products."
"India is country having high population and great variations in the
educational level, economic conditions, population densities, cultures and
awareness levels. Due to these variations the immunization process is not so
much successful as per expectations of the state and central governments. In
some zones the significant amount of vaccines are wasted whereas some are
running out of vaccines. One of the reasons for such an imbalance is improper
quantity estimation of vaccines in a particular zone. Further a huge amount of
liquidity will be wasted in the form of vaccines. If we inculcate ICT
(Information and Communication Technology) in the process of immunization then
the problem can be rectified to some extent and hence we are proposing a
conceptual model using ICT to improve the process of vaccination."
"The Global Games Jam (GGJ) attracts many people who are passionate about
games development, coming from a range of educational backgrounds. Therefore,
the event can be experienced by novices and student developers as an
opportunity for learning. This provides an opening to promote themes and ideas
that could help form future thinking about games design, emerging as a form of
induction on key design issues for new practitioners. Such an approach aims to
raise awareness about issues which learners could help develop and take with
them into industry. However, the experience itself affords a deep experiential
rhetoric and dialogue with experts that could be an effective pedagogical tool
for issues seldom addressed deeply in formal educational settings. This paper
describes an account by one such individual, being introduced to game
accessibility through participation in the GGJ. As such, it is not intended as
a rigorous empirical analysis, but rather a perspective on one way a game jam
can be experienced, inviting further research on the topic."
"In year 2006 Biolinux inter alia with the work of Tim Booth gives its rise
and provide an operating system that was and is specialized in providing an
environment for the needs of bioinformatics. Since than some years have been
seen and the information about Biolinux has not only widespread within the
bio-science community, also the Linux community at whole had a ear for it. This
has caused a process called collaboration across borders and makes as the
keywords say the different work groups cooperating together. In this paper we
will have a look into the history of this collaboration, will show its growth
until we reach the actual state and we will talk about the quo vadis of this

"This study provides details on the motivational factors for using blogs as an
essential tool to promote students writing skills in ESL classrooms. The study
aims to discuss how using blogs may be integrated into classroom activities to
promote students writing skills as well as polishing their skills. It would
also illustrate the features offered in blogs as well as the motivational
essence that is attached to the blogs. To achieve the aim of the study, a
semi-structured interview protocol was used to collect the required qualitative
data. The findings of the study would serve as an insistent reminder that the
blogs which have been clearly underlined in the curriculum should be
re-orchestrated more effectively again by the teachers of English as a Second
Language (ESL)."
"This study aims to investigate the teachers perceptions on the use of visual
aids (e.g., animation videos, pictures, films and projectors) as a motivational
tool in enhancing students interest in reading literary texts. To achieve the
aim of the study, the mixed-method approach was used to collect the required
data. Therefore, 52 English teachers from seven national secondary schools in
Kapit, Sarawak, Malaysia were selected. Five of the respondents were also
randomly selected for the interview. The analysis of the data indicated that
the majority of the teachers had positive perceptions of the use of visual
aids. The use of visual aids enable the teachers to engage their students
closely with the literary texts despite of being able to facilitate students of
different English proficiency level in reading the texts with interest. This
aspect is vital as literature helps to generate students creative and critical
thinking skills. Although the teachers had positive attitudes towards the use
of visual aids, the study suggests that it will be more interesting and precise
if it includes students perceptions as well."
"Using the possible synergy among geographic, size, and technological
distributions of firms in the Orbis database, we find the greatest reduction of
uncertainty at the level of the 31 provinces of China, and an additional 18.0%
at the national level. Some of the coastal provinces stand out as expected, but
the metropolitan areas of Beijing and Shanghai are (with Tianjan and Chonqing)
most pronounced at the next-lower administrative level of (339) prefectures,
since these four metropoles are administratively defined at both levels.
Focusing on high- and medium-tech manufacturing, a shift toward Beijing and
Shanghai is indicated, and the synergy is on average enhanced (as expected; but
not for all provinces). Unfortunately, the Orbis data is incomplete since it
was collected for commercial and not for administrative or governmental
purposes. However, we show a methodology that can be used by others who may
have access to higher-quality statistical data for the measurement."
"While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends have
witnessed an increasing number of people sharing their email passwords with
friends, colleagues, and significant others. However, leading websites like
Google advise their users not to share their passwords with anyone, to avoid
security and privacy breaches. To understand users' general password sharing
behavior and practices, we conducted an online survey with 209 Indian
participants and found that 64.35% of the participants felt a need to share
their email passwords. Further, about 77% of the participants said that they
would want to use a system which could provide them access control features, to
maintain their privacy while sharing emails. To address the privacy concerns of
users who need to share emails, we propose ChaMAILeon, a system which enables
users to share their email passwords while maintaining their privacy.
ChaMAILeon allows users to create multiple passwords for their email account.
Each such password corresponds to a different set of access control rules, and
gives a different view of the same email account. We conducted a controlled
experiment with 30 participants to evaluate the usability of the system. Each
participant was required to perform 5 tasks. Each task corresponded to
different access control rules, which the participant was required to set, for
a dummy email account. We found that, with a reasonable number of multiple
attempts, all 30 participants were able to perform all 5 tasks given to them.
The system usability score was found out to be 75.42. Moreover, 56.6% of the
participants said that they would like to use ChaMAILeon frequently."
"Using a private car is a transportation system very common in industrialized
countries. However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil,
traffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of
personal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i.e.
sharing a trip on a private car of a driver with one or more passengers.
Carpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide
environmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and
passengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies.
Typically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on
his/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips
and contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long
trips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is
not used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering
this service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption.
Dynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and
increasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling
impromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street
and can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no
dynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize
such systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic
carpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of
dynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It
proposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic
carpooling systems."
"Recent studies show that the TV viewing experience is changing giving the
rise of trends like ""multi-screen viewing"" and ""connected viewers"". These
trends describe TV viewers that use mobile devices (e.g. tablets and smart
phones) while watching TV. In this paper, we exploit the context information
available from the ubiquitous mobile devices to detect the presence of TVs and
track the media being viewed. Our approach leverages the array of sensors
available in modern mobile devices, e.g. cameras and microphones, to detect the
location of TV sets, their state (ON or OFF), and the channels they are
currently tuned to. We present the feasibility of the proposed sensing
technique using our implementation on Android phones with different realistic
scenarios. Our results show that in a controlled environment a detection
accuracy of 0.978 F-measure could be achieved."
"This paper reviews major studies in three traditional lines of research in
residential energy consumption in the UK, i.e. economic/infrastructure,
behaviour, and load profiling. Based on the review the paper proposes a
three-dimensional model for archetyping residential energy consumers in the UK
by considering property energy efficiency levels, the greenness of household
behaviour of using energy, and the duration of property daytime occupancy. With
the proposed model, eight archetypes of residential energy consumers in the UK
have been identified. They are: pioneer greens, follower greens, concerned
greens, home stayers, unconscientious wasters, regular wasters, daytime
wasters, and disengaged wasters. Using a case study, these archetypes of
residential energy consumers demonstrate the robustness of the 3-D model in
aiding local energy policy/intervention design in the UK."
"Preventive care service delivery faces immense challenges when it comes to
the level of coverage. Within this context, the case of child immunization is
presented by applying operations management tools. This paper explores the
application of integer programming techniques to support the Expanded Programme
of Immunization (EPI) service in the Dera Ismail Khan District of Pakistan. The
main concern here is equitable service delivery to decentralized localities
based on two criteria: (1) achieving the highest possible level of vaccination
among the target population; and 2) ensuring equality among geographically
scattered populations, especially in rural dwellings. For this purpose two
integer programming models have been applied on the basis of (1) sub-dividing
health district into localities and allocating vaccinators to visit and
vaccinate children within their administrative boundaries, and (2) within the
localized planning system allowing vaccinators to visit and vaccinate children
across the administrative boundaries subject to savings in travel time. Both
models show interesting results in terms of need satisfaction and travel-time
savings with a minimum level of deviation from equity. The solutions provide a
trade-off between alternative organizational tactics, and the argument is made
that rational planning methods applied interactively can contribute to the
delivery of an immunization service that is equitable and cost effective."
"The word 'researcher' is loaded and often confusing. It takes years to become
one and to master all of its aspects. In this paper, we investigate whether or
not this process of 'becoming' can be catalyzed through education. The focus
will be on wireless communications, though the same principle could very well
be replicated to other disciplines."
"The article first summarizes reasons why current approaches supporting Open
Learning and Distance Education need to be complemented by tools permitting
lecturers, researchers and students to cooperatively organize the semantic
content of Learning related materials (courses, discussions, etc.) into a
fine-grained shared semantic network. This first part of the article also
quickly describes the approach adopted to permit such a collaborative work.
Then, examples of such semantic networks are presented. Finally, an evaluation
of the approach by students is provided and analyzed."
"In this paper, we will explain a successfully proven lecturing method based
entirely on system design. Wireless communications will be used as an example
to explain this new teaching philosophy."
"We surveyed every state and the District of Columbia to see what patient
specific information states release on hospital visits and how much potentially
identifiable information is released in those records. Thirty-three states
release hospital discharge data in some form, with varying levels of
demographic information and hospital stay details such as hospital name,
admission and discharge dates, diagnoses, doctors who attended to the patient,
payer, and cost of the stay. We compared the level of demographic and other
data to federal standards set by the Health Information Portability and
Accountability Act or HIPAA), which states do not have to adhere to for this
type of data. We found that states varied widely in whether their data was
HIPAA equivalent; while 13 were equivalent (or stricter) with demographic
fields only 3 of the 33 states that released data did so in a form that was
HIPAA equivalent across all fields."
"ICT or Information and Communication Technology has pervaded the fields of
education.In recent years the term e-learning has emerged as a result of the
integration of ICT in the education fields. Following the application this
technology into teaching, some pitfalls have been identified and this have led
to the Blended learning phenomenon.However the preference on this new method
has been debated quite extensively.The aim of this paper is to investigate the
advantages of blended learning over face to face instruction through reviews of
related literature.The present survey revealed that blended learning is more
favorable than pure e-learning and offers many advantages for learners like
producing a sense of community or belonging.This study concludes that blended
learning can be considered as an efficient approach of distance learning in
terms of students' learning experience student-student interaction as well as
studentinstructor interaction and is likely to emerge as the predominant
education model in the future."
"A lot of attention in supply chain management has been devoted to
understanding customer requirements. What are customer priorities in terms of
price and service level, and how can companies go about fulfilling these
requirements in an optimal way? New manufacturing technology in the form of 3D
printing is about to change some of the underlying assumptions for different
supply chain set-ups. This paper explores opportunities and barriers of 3D
printing technology, specifically in a supply chain context. We are proposing a
set of principles that can act to bridge existing research on different supply
chain strategies and 3D printing. With these principles, researchers and
practitioners alike can better understand the opportunities and limitations of
3D printing in a supply chain management context."
"The aim of this study is to investigate the style of Facebook usage between
undergraduate students and the impact on their academics performance. Also,
this paper was evaluated in the view of student the using of Facebook. A
questioner was design for collecting data from a sample of 480 undergraduate
students in Irbid National University. The survey revealed that 77% of the
students have an account on Facebook. One of the main findings is that there
was a significant relationship between gender and Facebook usage. Moreover, the
survey revealed that whenever the less time spent on Facebook, the higher the
performance will be in grade point average. This was conducted by the negative
correlation between time spent on Facebook and the performance of undergraduate
student. Statistically speaking, the study has seven hypotheses; two of them
were rejecting against five acceptable hypotheses."
"Comparison of answers offered by a computer algebra system (CAS) with answers
derived by a student without a CAS is relevant, for instance, in the context of
computer-aided assessment (CAA). The issues of identity, equivalence and
correctness emerge in different ways and are important for CAA. These issues
are also interesting if a student is charged with the task of comparing the
answers. What will happen when students themselves are encouraged to analyse
differences, equivalence and correctness of their own answers and CAS answers?
What differences do they notice foremost? Would they recognise
equivalence/non-equivalence? How do they explain equivalence/non-equivalence?
The paper discusses these questions on the basis of lessons where the students
solved trigonometric equations. Ten equations were chosen with the aim to
ensure that the expected school answer and the CAS answer would differ in
various ways. Three of them are discussed more thoroughly in this paper."
"As technologies are developed and constructed, designers may or may not be
aware that they are embedding politics and values into their artifacts.
Computer scientists operate and advance their field by building layers of
abstraction into software and hardware to reduce the complexity of interfaces,
making the artifacts they create zuhanden for others in part by imposing
constraints. The increasing reliance of global populations and economies on
communication mediated by many information and communications technologies
(ICTs) transforms them from applications into communications infrastructure,
elevating the importance of considering the values embodied in those
infrastructures. I argue that the status quo bias and economic inertia of
built-infrastructure requires a reevaluation of research in light of the de
facto global technocracy to consider a nouveau social contract between
infrastructural theorists, scientists, designers, and engineers and the current
and future generations who will be constrained by that infrastructure as it is
reified. The CHI community is uniquely situated to establish a norm of
including a discussion of the implications of appropriation as first class
topic in research output."
"Are there qualitative and quantitative traits of system design that
contribute to the ability of people to further innovate? We propose that
extrinsic adaptability, the ability given to secondary parties to change a
system to match new requirements not envisioned by the primary provider, is
such a trait. ""Extrinsic adaptation"" encompasses the popular concepts of
""workaround"", ""fast prototype extension"" or ""hack"", and extrinsic adaptability
is thus a measure of how friendly a system is to tinkering by curious minds. In
this report, we give ""hackability"" or ""hacker-friendliness"" scientific
credentials by formulating and studying a generalization of the concept. During
this exercise, we find that system changes by secondary parties fall on a
subjective gradient of acceptability, with extrinsic adaptations on one side
which confidently preserve existing system features, and invasive modifications
on the other side which are perceived to be disruptive to existing system
features. Where a change is positioned on this gradient is dependent on how an
external observer perceives component boundaries within the changed system. We
also find that the existence of objective cost functions can alleviate but not
fully eliminate this subjectiveness. The study also enables us to formulate an
ethical imperative for system designers to promote extrinsic adaptability."

operations."
"Gamification is an emerging design principle for information systems where
game design elements are applied to non-game contexts. IS researchers have
suggested that the IS discipline must study this area but there are other
applications such as serious games, and simulations that also use games in
non-game contexts. Specifically, the management field has been using games and
simulations for years and these applications are now being supported by
information systems. We propose in this paper that we must think beyond
gamification, towards other uses of games in non-gaming contexts, which we call
purposeful gaming.
  In this paper we identify how the IS discipline can adapt to purposeful
gaming. Specifically, we show how IT artifacts, IS design, and IS theories can
be used in the purposeful gaming area. We also provide three conceptual
dimensions of purposeful gaming that can aid IS practitioners and researchers
to classify and understand purposeful games."
"In this paper, we proposed the Survival Language, a pattern language to
support survival when a catastrophic earthquake occurs. This proposal comes
from the problem that the tragedies of earthquakes are repeated, because
knowledge and wisdom on how to prepare for an earthquake and what to do during
an earthquake have not been passed down sufficiently. This paper presented the
four patterns of the Survival Language: ""Daily Use of Reserves,"" ""Life over
Furniture,"" ""Evacuation Initiator,"" and ""Kick Signal."" In addition, we
described that the Survival Language is created and used by collaborations
because a pattern language has been a tool for collaboration since it was
presented by Christopher Alexander."
"This paper proposes new languages for basic skills in the Creative Society,
where people create their own goods, tools, concepts, knowledge, and mechanisms
with their own hands: the skills of learning, presentation, and collaboration.
These languages are written as a pattern language, which is a way of describing
the tacit practical knowledge. In this paper, a new type of pattern languages
are proposed as ""Pattern Languages 3.0"" and three examples are introduced:
Learning Patterns, Collaboration Patterns, and Presentation Patterns. By
analyzing the functions with the social systems theory and the creative systems
theory, pattern languages are considered as communication media and discovery
media."
"In this paper, we propose the Global Life Patterns, a methodology to support
people to maintain individuality and design their own actions in respect to the
""globalizing"" society - a Global Life. Today, globalization requires each
person to maintain individuality in respect to Globalization. Because methods
to acquire such ability are tacit, a clarified methodology to live a Global
Life is needed.This methodology is based on the format of a Pattern Language -
specifically, this methodology is in the format of the Pattern Language 3.0
(Iba, 2012)."
"Is there a relationship between computing costs and the confidence people
place in the behavior of computing systems? What are the tuning knobs one can
use to optimize systems for human confidence instead of correctness in purely
abstract models? This report explores these questions by reviewing the
mechanisms by which people build confidence in the match between the physical
world behavior of machines and their abstract intuition of this behavior
according to models or programming language semantics. We highlight in
particular that a bottom-up approach relies on arbitrary trust in the accuracy
of I/O devices, and that there exists clear cost trade-offs in the use of I/O
devices in computing systems. We also show various methods which alleviate the
need to trust I/O devices arbitrarily and instead build confidence
incrementally ""from the outside"" by considering systems as black box entities.
We highlight cases where these approaches can reach a given confidence level at
a lower cost than bottom-up approaches."
"Having developed greatly over millennium under its culture, the ancient
buildings and old town atmospheres maintain a quality of comfort. However,
people only appreciate the ""good old"" quality and do not think further about
the rational reasons why they feel comfort in it. This keeps them from creating
their own things and models with good old quality, relying on the imported
western thinking and methods as a result of modernization. Since people are now
struggling under the imbalanced and complex society, we believe that support is
needed for generating things and frameworks with good old quality in modern
time situations and scenes."
"This paper presents the course design titled ""Learning Management"" of which
the goal is to ""learn collaborative learning"" for a first-year undergraduate
student. The objective of the class design is to help transform the student's
belief of learning from a passive, individual model to an active, collaborative
model which is supported by the concept of ""Knowledge Building"" or
""Constructive Interaction"". We conducted an empirical study where the students
analyzed their own discourse with KBDeX which is the software they used to
assist their analysis in the experimental group whereas the students in the
control group reflected their project activities in their own way. We examined
the transformation of their beliefs through the qualitative analysis of their
reports after the course. The results showed that the design led to the
transforming of their learning beliefs from ""just experiences of the
participation of the collaborative learning"" to ""active contribution for
collaborative knowledge creation"". The course succeeded in changing the
students' preferences about collaborative learning from negative to positive as
well."
"This paper will discuss the need for national-level organizational strategies
to effectively combat cyber security threats and cybercrime. In many countries,
new agencies have been established and/or new roles have been allotted to
existing agencies to cope with the needs for cyber security or fighting against
cybercrime. The two pillars of organizational structure and functions (i.e.,
security vs. law enforcement) have given new challenges to us, especially in
the context of traditional criminal justice system. To illustrate the
challenges, a case study examining the responses to major security incidents
followed by nationwide debates and remarkable organizational changes in Korea
will be given."
"This paper addresses the strategic challenges of deposit banks, and payment
clearinghouses, posed by the growing role of mobile operators as collectors and
payment agents for flows of cash for themselves and third parties. Through
analysis and data analysis from selected operators, it is shown that mobile
operators achieve as money flow handlers levels of efficiency,
profitability,and risk control comparable with deposit banks. Furthermore, the
payment infrastructures deployed by both are found to be quite similar, and are
analyzed in relation to financial profitability, strategic challenges and
opportunities. This paves the way to either mobile operators taking a bigger
role,or for banks to tie up such operators to them even more tightly,or for
alliances/mergers to take place,all these options being subject to regulatory
evolution which is analyzed as well . The consequences are mapped out in
operational and regulatory terms"
"The communications systems, terminals, software and deployment service,
industries, have undergone the past ten years a significant technological
internal evolution and external revolution at customer end (such as Internet,
Mobile networks and terminals, Broadband,..). Very little management research
has studied their financial survivability irrespective of changes in demand
volumes in the present technological /organizational cycle. This paper analyzes
the implications of genuine open mandated communications standards, of higher
product volumes, of very high R&D, of the larger use of sourced /purchased
technologies, and of contract manufacturing. The methodology used is
equilibrium analyses. Two specific areas will be mentioned as examples. The
paper also shows how eventually those industries in a later cycle will bounce
back."
"Due to widespread demand of E-governance and exponentially increasing size of
data, new technologies like Open source solutions and cloud computing need to
be incorporated. In this paper, the latest trends of technology that the
government of most of the country has adopted have been discussed. While
working on this project we have concluded that E-Governance has made the
working of government more efficient and more transparent to its citizens We
have also presented an exhaustive list of E-Governance projects which is
currently being used in India and in international scenario. We have provided a
mechanism for improving E-Governance by including technologies such as Open
Source and Cloud Computing."
"A Triple Helix (TH) of bi- and trilateral relations among universities,
industries, and governments can be considered as an ecosystem in which
uncertainty can be reduced auto-catalytically. The correlations among the
distributions of relations span a vector space in which two vectors (P and Q)
represent ""sending"" and ""receiving,"" respectively. These vectors can also be
understood in terms of the generation versus reduction of uncertainty in the
communication field that results from interactions among the three (bi-lateral)
communication channels. We specify a set of Lotka-Volterra equations between
the vectors that can be solved. Redundancy generation can then be simulated and
the results can be decomposed in terms of the TH components. Among other
things, we show that the strength and frequency of the relations are
independent parameters. Different components in terms of frequencies in
triple-helix systems can also be distinguished and interpreted using Fourier
analysis of the empirical time-series. The case of co-authorship relations in
Japan is analyzed as an empirical example; but ""triple contingencies"" in an
ecosystem of relations can also be considered more generally as a model for
redundancy generation by providing meaning to the (Shannon-type) information in
inter-human communications."
"The subscribers base of mobile phones is increasing globally with a rapid

"Information and communication technologies brought-in tools and techniques in
the field of education that introduced new concepts of teaching and learning.
Learning management system is one of the key tools used in educational
institutes to facilitate e-learning. There is remarkable digital divide among
urban and rural areas. In this paper, we present a model for providing
e-learning services to remote/rural areas in order to promote and facilitate
modern education. A dedicated resource center, hosting the learning management
system, facilitates e-learning centers through Internet. The overall goal of
this model is to have a cost-effective learning environment equipped with
latest technologies to provide learners an opportunity to get insight into new
information and communication technologies and e-learning environment. The
model offers new teaching methodology with enhance utilization of learning
management system in teaching and learning. Basic characteristics and technical
aspects will be considered as well. The study will also promote development and
usage of open-source technologies."
"Bangladesh is an over populated developing country where crisis of food is a
major issue, it faces different infrastructure problem in every sector. For
Poverty Alleviation from the country we have to confirm cultivable land to
increase the crop production for feeding the over population of the country.
This paper focuses on the measurement of cultivable land for cultivation. The
main purpose of this paper is to briefly describe how the GIS, Digital Mapping,
Internet concepts and tools can effectively contribute in the modeling,
analysis and visualization phases within an engineering or research project
according to the crops by using object detection, object tracking and field
mapping in Bangladesh. Through GIS mapping of the agricultural lands, the
statistics can be made of how much land is cultivable and each year how much
land we are losing. Mapping the cultivation land will tell us how much crop we
have to import from other countries. Enabling real-time GIS analysis anytime,
anywhere, the implementation of the GIS information to a wider aspect.
Automation is the indicator of the modern civilizations. The system will
benefit the food stock of the country according to the harvest. For this
research we developed a new interactive system. The system will integrate with
GIS project data in Google Earth, first finds highly accurate cluster images
and partial images, obtains user feedback to merge or correct these digests,
and then the supplementary visual analysis complete the partitioning of the
data. This study was conducted at the software laboratory, Computer Science and
Engineering department, Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2013."
"The performance of a business is chiefly determined by the business model
adopted and its environment of operation. This paper emphasizes on the
integration of Web 2.0 services like social networking to your existing
business, which helps in the progressive sustainability of the business
organization. The usage of Web 2.0 tools, such as Wikipedia, blogs and social
networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Orkut by individuals in all
societies, has been pervasive and very successful in proliferating their use at
the professional or business levels. This paper puts forth the discussion which
helps in better understanding of what social networking encompasses for present
day business. It also aims to educate business decision makers about the
benefits and risks associated in incorporating business model with social
networking. Thus, the paper focuses on the implementation of social networking
platforms in business operations and discusses the different attributes of
business performance and gives an overview in choosing a social networking
platform for its business purposes."
"This work proposes a method for the measurement of a country's digital
investigation capacity and saturation for the assessment of future capacity
expansion. The focus is on external, or international, partners being a factor
that could negatively affect the return on investment when attempting to expand
investigation capacity nationally. This work concludes with the argument that
when dealing with digital crime, target international partners should be a
consideration in expansion, and could potentially be a bottleneck of
investigation requests."
"Programming is a craft which often demands that learners engage in a
significantly high level of individual practice and experimentation in order to
acquire basic competencies. However, practice behaviours can be undermined
during the early stages of instruction. This is often the result of seemingly
trivial misconceptions that, when left unchecked, create cognitive-affective
barriers. These interact with learners' self-beliefs, potentially inducing
affective states that inhibit practice. This paper questions how to design a
learning environment that can address this issue. It is proposed that
analytical and adaptable approaches, which could include soft scaffolding,
ongoing detailed informative feedback and a focus on self-enhancement alongside
skill development, can help overcome such barriers."
"Concerning its development in the virtual classroom, the web 2.0 educational
innovation means the use and the production of textbooks and the
personalisation of the classnotes. The controversy, that is a precondition of
awareness, organized around the assignment of knowledge to a central authority
vs its grant to individuals who need it to share their plans with others, would
meet the present dynamism of e-learning. To introduce these training strategies
with scientific information in marine sciences, an online course was
transformed into an opportunity for evaluating and living open access."
": Introduction-objectives: A virtual-reality learning environment dedicated
to prostate biopsies was designed to overcome the limitations of current
classical teaching methods. The aim of this study was to validate reliability,
face, content and construct of the simulator. Materials and methods: The
simulator is composed of a) a laptop computer, b) a haptic device with a stylus
that mimics the ultrasound probe, c) a clinical case database including three
dimensional (3D) ultrasound volumes and patient data and d) a learning
environment with a set of progressive exercises including a randomized 12-core
biopsy procedure. Both visual (3D biopsy mapping) and numerical (score)
feedback are given to the user. The simulator evaluation was conducted in an
academic urology department on 7 experts and 14 novices who each performed a
virtual biopsy procedure and completed a face and content validity
questionnaire. Results: The overall realism of the biopsy procedure was rated
at a median of 9/10 by non-experts (7.1-9.8). Experts rated the usefulness of
the simulator for the initial training of urologists at 8.2/10 (7.9-8.3), but
reported the range of motion and force feedback as significantly less realistic
than novices (p=0.01 and 0.03 respectively). Pearson's r correlation
coefficient between correctly placed biopsies on the right and left side of the
prostate for each user was 0.79 (p<0.001). The 7 experts had a median score of
64% (59-73), and the 14 novices a median score of 52% (43-67), without reaching
statistical significance (p=0,19). Conclusion: The newly designed virtual
reality learning environment proved its versatility and its reliability, face
and content were validated. Demonstrating the construct validity will require
improvements to the realism and scoring system used."
"The impact of new technologies in the field of healthcare has been proven to
be satisfactory in improving the quality of care and services for patients. The
hospital environment is undoubtedly one of the environments where human or
hardware errors can cause harmful damage. It is therefore very useful for the
sector to be at the forefront of technology and use the strongest and most
efficient means since it is supposed to be an environment of reliability, trust
and is legally responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of all patient
information. In this project we have proposed and developed a smart hospital
enviornement that allows both, detecting patien fall and send alerts to the
suitable parties, and securing patien stored data through RFID technology."
"With the emergence and rapid growth of Social Media, a number of government
departments in several countries have embraced Social Media as a privilege
channel to interact with their constituency. We are exploring, in collaboration
with the Australian Department of Human Services, the possibility to exploit
the potential of social networks to support specific groups of citizens. To
this end, we have developed Next Step, an online community to help people
currently receiving welfare payments find a job and become financially
self-sufficient. In this paper, we explore some ethical issues that arise when
governments engage directly with citizens, in particular with communities in
difficult situations, and when researchers are involved. We describe some of
the challenges we faced and how we addressed them. Our work highlights the
complexity of the problem, when an online community involves a government
department and a welfare recipient group with a dependency relationship with
that department. It becomes a balancing act, with the need to ensure privacy of
the community members whilst still fulfilling the government's legal
responsibilities. While difficult, these issues must be addressed if
governments are to engage with their citizens using Social Media."
"Pearltrees is a social service, using which people can organise Web contents,
photos and notes. These contents are the ""pearls"" on some trees. Besides the
social opportunities, the trees can be used as a tool to organise references
and for content curation. However, they can be helpful for teaching purposes
too."

"Although man has become sedentary over time, his wish to travel the world
remains as strong as ever. The aim of this paper is to show how techniques
based on imagery and Augmented Reality (AR) can prove to be of great help when
discovering a new urban environment and observing the evolution of the natural

few years has become our most familiar device, which we take with us
practically everywhere we go in our daily lives."
"Geospatial applications are becoming indispensible part of information
systems, they provides detailed informations regarding the attribute data of
spatial objects in real world. Due to the rapid technological developments in
web based geographical information systems, the uses of web based geospatial
application varies from Geotagging to Geolocation capabilities. Therefore,
effective utilization of web based information system can only be realized by
representing the world in its original view, where attributes data of spatial
objects are integrated with spatial object and available for the user on the
web, using integrated Google API and Google Earth API. In this study a city in
the south-western part of Nigeria called EDE is examined and used as a case
study. Using Google Map API and Google Earth API, the attribute data of the
study area stored in XML databases will be integrated with the corresponding
existing spatial data of the study area; to create a web based 3D geospatial
application. We envisage that this system will enhance the effectiveness of
web-based Geographical Information System (GIS) and the overall user
experience."
"This paper presents a collaborative 3D GIS to support public participation.
Realizing that public-involved decision making is often a multi-stage process,
the proposed system is designed to provide coherent support for collaborations
in the different stages. We differentiate ubiquitous participation and
intensive participation, and identify their suitable application stages. The
proposed system, then, supports both of the two types of participation by
providing synchronous and asynchronous collaboration functionalities. Applying
the concept of Digital Earth, the proposed system also features a virtual
globe-based user interface. Such an interface integrates a variety of data,
functions and services into a unified virtual environment which is delivered to
both experts and public participants through the Internet. The system has been
designed as a general software framework, and can be tailored for specific
projects. In this study, we demonstrate it using a scene modeling case and
provide a preliminary evaluation towards its usability."
"This paper presents a household cooling system controller which is adaptive
and intelligent in nature. It is able to control the speed of a household
cooling fan or an air conditioner based on the real time data namely room
temperature, humidity and time i.e. duration, which are collected from
environment. To control the speed in an adaptive and intelligent manner an
associative memory neural network has been used. This embedded system is able
to learn from training set i.e. the user can teach the system about his/her
feelings through training data sets. When the system starts up it allows the
fan to run freely i.e. at full speed and after certain interval it takes the
environmental parameters like room temperature, humidity and time i.e.
duration, as an input and after that system takes the decision and controls the
speed of the fan."
"It is known that diabetes can not be cured completely, but it can be
controlled. The objective of this work is to provide an automatic system that
will be able to help the diabetic patient to control the blood sugar. This
system measures the blood sugar level of the people from their urine
round-the-clock. A recorded message based on this input may be displayed so
that apart from patient himself others can be informed about his/her present
sugar level. That should help him/her in taking medicine; controlling diet etc.
This work is an application of image processing and fuzzy logic. It is known
that Benedict's reagent changes its colour based on the sugar level. This
colour change information is sensed by the transducer and fed to the fuzzy
logic unit for decision making."
"In the paper we analyze the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
and their impact on developing countries (DCs), making a criticism of different
views on the supposed role of ICT for the future of human society. This
criticism is seen from the point of view of a small developing post-communist
country as Albania, hoping that the conclusions would throw some light for
developing countries in general, especially those in a transition stage. We
examine some aspects of international collaboration and security, where the ICT
implemented in the public administration may have an important impact. The
development policies and practices are examined, including relations between
public and private sectors. Following arguments of many authors, we identify or
redefine some crucial factors that negatively impact the role of ICT in the
development of the country, its relations with the international community, and
ways to push forward its development."
"Literature has shown that countries such as Brazil and India have
successfully implemented electronic voting systems and other countries are at
various piloting stages to address many challenges associated with manual paper
based system such ascosts of physical ballot paper and other overheads,
electoral delays, distribution of electoral materials, and general lack of
confidence in the electoral process. It is in this context that this study
explores how South African can leverage the opportunities that e-voting
presents. Manual voting is often tedious, non-secure, and time-consuming, which
leads us to think about using electronic facilities to make the process more
efficient. This study proposes that the adoption of electronic voting
technologies could perhaps mitigate some of these issues and challengesin the
process improving the electoral process. The study used an on-line
questionnaire which was administered to a broader group of voters and an
in-depth semi-structured interview with the Independent Electoral Commission
officials. The analysis is based on thematic analysis and diffusion of
innovations theory is adopted as a theoretical lens of analysis. The findings
reveal that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity would determine
the intentions of South African voters and the Electoral Management Bodies
(IEC) to adopt e-voting technologies. Moreover, the findings also reveal
several other factorsthat could influence the adoption process. The study is
limited to only voters in Cape Town and these voters were expected to have some
access to the internet. The sample size limits the generalizability of the
findings of this study."
"For a moment, imagine an active online learning community of writers,
artists, and designers, many spending more than eight hours a week composing
projects. In this community, young people, primarily between the ages of 18-26,
regularly critique, facilitate, and support each other in their composition
activities. They are motivated to participate by their shared interest and
affinity for their creative work. In the age of Wikipedia, this might not seem
particularly novel, but what I am actually describing is an online discussion
board, RPGmakerVX.net. Elsewhere, I have presented a general outline of the
kinds of individuals involved in this community and the way that the site as a
whole functions as an open learning environment (Owens, 2010). In this essay, I
present a case study of one participant in this community. His user name is Mr.
Moo, and at the time I interviewed him, he was a 19 year old college student
from Calgary, Canada. When he created his first role-playing game, Prelude of
Identity, he was eighteen. After providing a conceptual context for this case
study in work on collective intelligence, I draw out the relationship between
the technical system of the discussion boards and the creative process of
engaging with peers in the production of a video game. I suggest that the
discussion board rules and interaction enable a dialogue around composition
that ultimately leaves Mr. Moo with a valuable learning experience while also
producing a role-playing game. Thinking about this system from the perspective
of collective intelligence enables us to use these kinds of interest-driven,
online affinity communities as tools in an open education tool kit for
educators in more formal learning environments. Ultimately, discussion boards
in gaming communities, both the technical and social systems they represent,
could be thought of as instructional tools."
"The modernization of the educational process in the ungraded schools of the
Republic of Kazakhstan requires the provision of affordable quality education
for students in rural areas on information technology, the creation of
e-learning. It was important to consider two points: how does e-learning
influence the educational process in ungraded schools, and directly on the
quality of teaching, and what results can thus be achieved. The significance of
the work is also to explore innovative approaches to e-learning system of
ungraded schools."
"In this study, regional (cities, towns and villages) data and tweet data are
obtained from Twitter, and extract information of purchase information (Where
and what bought) from the tweet data by morphological analysis and rule-based
dependency analysis. Then, the ""The regional information"" and ""The information
of purchase history (Where and what bought information)"" are captured as
bipartite graph, and Responsiveness Pair Clustering analysis (a clustering
using correspondence analysis as similarity measure) is conducted. In this
study, since it was found to be difficult to analyze a network such as
bipartite graph having limitations in links by using modularity Q,
responsiveness is used instead of modularity Q as similarity measure. As a
result of this analysis, ""regional information cluster"" which refers to similar
""The information of purchase history"" nodes group is generated. Finally,
similar regions are visualized by mapping the regional information cluster on
the map. This visualization system is expected to contribute as an analytical
tool for customers purchasing behavior and so on."
"The awareness and sense of privacy has increased in the minds of people over
the past few years. Earlier, people were not very restrictive in sharing their
personal information, but now they are more cautious in sharing it with
strangers, either in person or online. With such privacy expectations and
attitude of people, it is difficult to embrace the fact that a lot of
information is publicly available on the web. Information portals in the form
of the e-governance websites run by Delhi Government in India provide access to
such PII without any anonymization. Several databases e.g., Voterrolls, Driving
Licence number, MTNL phone directory, PAN card serve as repositories of
personal information of Delhi residents. This large amount of available
personal information can be exploited due to the absence of proper written law
on privacy in India. PII can also be collected from various social networking
sites like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus etc. where the users share some
information about them. Since users themselves put this information, it may not
be considered as a privacy breach, but if the information is aggregated, it may
give out much more information resulting in a bigger threat. To bring such
issues to public notice, we developed Open-source Collation of eGovernment data
And Networks (OCEAN), a system where the user enters little information (e.g.
Name) about a person and gets large amount of personal information about him /
her like name, age, address, date of birth, mother's name, father's name, voter
ID, driving licence number, PAN."
"In recent years, mobile operations have gained wide popularity among
mainstream users, and banks tend to follow this trend. But are bank customers
ready to move forward? Mobile banking appears to be a natural extension of
Internet banking. Thus, to predict consumer decisions to adopt mobile banking,
it is useful to understand the pattern of adoption of Internet banking (IB).
This investigation seeks contribute to an expansion of the knowledge regarding
this matter by researching Portuguese consumers patterns and behaviors
concerning the acceptance and use intention of IB as a foundation for
establishing growth strategies of mobile banking. For data collection, we used
an online snowball process. The statistical treatment used included a factor
analysis in order to allow examination of the interrelationships between the
original variables. The analysis was made possible by developing a set of
factors that expresses the common traits between them. The results revealed
that the majority of respondents did not identify problems with the use of and
interaction with the IB service. The study generated some interesting findings.
First, the data generally supports the conceptual framework presented. However,
some points need to be made: trust and convenience, from all the elements
referenced in the literature as relevant from the client perspective, continue
to be a very important elements; the results did not support the paradigm that
the characteristics of individuals affect their behavior as consumers,
individual technological characteristics affect consumer adoption of IB
service; consumer perceptions about the IB service affect their use, as reveal
by the existence of three types of customers that show different practices and
perceptions of IB; and intention to use IB is dependent upon attitudes and
subjective norms regarding the use of IB."

contributes many advantages in terms of economics, but if uncontrolled, would
produce negative consequences to the physical, social and natural environment.
With the advancement of GIS, which considerably influenced the dynamic nature
of urban and regional planning, incorporation of GIS becomes imperative for
better and improved decision-making in urban planning and management. It offers
a solution to the urban problems and decision-making, which is more reliant to
the real-time spatial modelling. The integration of Geographical Information
System (GIS) and Remote Sensing has provided a tool, which can contribute to
much clearer understanding of real planning problems as well as prescriptive
planning scenarios to enhance the quality of urban planning and management."
"""United we stand, divided we fall"" is a well known saying. We are living in
the era of virtual collaborations. Advancement on conceptual and technological
level has enhanced the way people communicate. Everything-as-a-Service once a
dream, now becoming a reality.
  Problem nature has also been changed over the time. Today, e-Collaborations
are applied to all the domains possible. Extensive data and computing resources
are in need and assistance from human experts is also becoming essential. This
puts a great responsibility on Information Technology (IT) researchers and
developers to provide generic platforms where user can easily communicate and
solve their problems. To realize this concept, distributed computing has
offered many paradigms, e.g. cluster, grid, cloud computing. Virtual
Organization (VO) is a logical orchestration of globally dispersed resources to
achieve common goals.
  Existing paradigms and technology are used to form Virtual Organization, but
lack of standards remained a critical issue for last two decades. Our research
endeavor focuses on developing a design blueprint for Virtual Organization
building process. The proposed standardization process is a two phase activity.
First phase provides requirement analysis and the second phase presents a
Reference Architecture for Virtual Organization (RAVO). This form of
standardization is chosen to accommodate both technological and paradigm shift.
We categorize our efforts in two parts. First part consists of a pattern to
identify the requirements and components of a Virtual Organization. Second part
details a generic framework based on the concept of Everything-as-a-Service."
"Prezi is a Hungarian software company, producing a cloud-based presentation
software and storytelling tool for presenting ideas on a virtual canvas

learning process. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of using Prezi
in Islamic education subject among secondary schools under the topic of
marriage in Islam: polygamy. Specifically its aims to identify students
interest and second examine their attitude towards the uses of Prezi in
learning Islamic educations. A total of 22 students participated in the survey,
employing a 22-item questionnaire. The data was analyzed quantitatively using
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Result from this study
revealed that student shows their interest in learning Islamic Educations when
teachers uses Prezi. In additions students also show positive attitude towards
uses of Prezi in Classroom. As conclusions, the uses of Prezi presentation is
easy and its technique for developing a more creative and innovative approach
in teaching strategies among Islamic educators."
"In computer simulation of the learning process is usually assumed that all
elements of the training material are assimilated equally durable. But in
practice, the knowledge, which a student uses in its operations, are remembered
much better. For a more precise study of didactic systems the multi component
model of learning are proposed. It takes into account: 1) the transition of
weak knowledge in trustworthy knowledge; 2) the difference in the rate of
forgetting the trustworthy and weak knowledge. It is assumed that the rate of
increase of student's knowledge is proportional to: 1) the difference between
the level of the requirements of teachers and the number of learned knowledge;
2) the amount of learned knowledge, raised to some power. Examples of the use
of a multi component model for the study of situations in the learning process
are considered, the resulting graphs of the student's level of knowledge of the
time are presented. A generalized model of learning, which allows to take into
account the complexity of the various elements of the educational material are
proposed. The possibility of creating a training program for the training of
students of pedagogical institutes are considered."
"Natural disasters are a large threat for people especially in developing
countries such as Laos. ICT-based disaster management systems aim at supporting
disaster warning and response efforts. However, the ability to directly
communicate in both directions between local and administrative level is often
not supported, and a tight integration into administrative workflows is
missing. In this paper, we present the smartphone-based disaster and reporting
system Mobile4D. It allows for bi-directional communication while being fully
involved in administrative processes. We present the system setup and discuss
integration into administrative structures in Lao PDR."
"One of the important problems of cyber pedagogy is the following: how,
knowing the parameters of the student, his initial level of knowledge and the
impact of the teacher to predict knowledge of student at subsequent times.
Simulation method allows you to create a computer program that simulates the
behavior of the 'teacher-student'-system and investigate the influence of
system parameters on the results of learning."
"The purpose of this research were: to survey the needs of using the
information system for educational quality administration; to develop
Information System for Educational quality Administration (ISEs) in accordance

conducted using real data collected from graduate profile at the Maejo
University in Thailand. The model is intended to be used for predicting whether
a graduate was employed, unemployed, or in an undetermined situation."
"The higher education has been greatly impacted by worldwide trends. In a
result, the universities throughout the world are focusing to enhance
performance and efficiency in their workings. Therefore, the higher education
has moved their systems to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to cope
with the needs of changing environment. However, the literature review
indicates that there is void on the evaluation of success or failure of ERP
systems in higher education Institutes in Pakistan. In overall, ERP systems
implementation in higher education of Pakistan has not been given appropriate
research focus. Thus, in this paper the authors have attempted to develop a
conceptual framework for ERP evaluation in Universities of Pakistan. This seeks
to expand the knowledge on ERP in higher educational institutes of Pakistan and
focuses on understanding the ERP related critical success factors."
"Information passing through internet is generally unrestricted and
uncontrollable and a good web content filter acts very much like a sieve. This
paper looks at how citizens internet viewing can be controlled using content
filters to prevent access to illegal sites and malicious contents in Nigeria.
Primary data were obtained by administering 100 questionnaires. The data was
analyzed by a software package called Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS). The result of the study shows that 66.4% of the respondents agreed that
the internet is been abused and the abuse can be controlled by the use of
content filters. The PHP, MySQL and Apache were used to design a content filter
program. It was recommended that a lot still need to be done by public
organizations, academic institutions, government and its agencies especially
the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria to control the
internet abuse by the under aged and criminals."
"The aim of this work is to design a semi-automatic application that can be
used as an aid by the doctors for smoothly conducting Hammersmith Infant
Neurological Examination (IDNE). A simplified version of the examination which
provides a quantitative neurological assessment is used to design the
application. The application includes a methodology of conducting IDNE
examination suited to inexperienced staff, applicable to both neonatal and
post-neonatal infants. It also provides a facility to go through the previous
records of a patient that can help in diagnosing patients with high risk of
neurological disorder. A semi-automatic approach is proposed for skeleton
generation. The application has been installed in hospitals and currently in
operation. It is expected to increase the efficiency of conducting HINE using
the proposed application."
"The recent employment and eventual widespread acceptance of electronic test
in examining students and various classes in Nigeria has created a significant
impact in the trends of educational history in the country. In this paper, we
examined the impacts, associated challenges and security lapses of the existing
electronic-examination system with the aim of ameliorating and developing a new
acceptable e-Exam system that takes care of the existing systems challenges and
security lapses. Six Universities that are already conducting e- Examination
were selected across the country for this research work. Twenty students that
participated in the e-exams and five members of staff were selected for
interview and questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the interviews and study
of the existing electronic examination system, some anomalies were discovered
and a new e-exams system was developed to eradicate these anomalies. The new
system uses data encryption in order to protect the questions sent to the
e-Examination center through the internet or intranet and a biometric
fingerprint authentication to screen the stakeholders."
"Smart card technology has resulted in vast developments in many aspects of
modern human life. User acceptance of fuel rationing smart cards based on
adoption model involves many factors such as: satisfaction, security, external
variables, attitude toward using, etc. In this study, user acceptance and
security factors for fuel rationing smart cards in Iran have been evaluated
based on an adoption model by distributing a questionnaire among UTM

practices. The result was revealing."
"Until now, there is no e-management and automation necessary for the
operations or procedures of the departments in the Technical Education
Foundation Erbil, and the foundation like any other organization in Kurdistan
region is not connected to the network, because there is not infrastructure for
that purpose. To solve this problem, comes the proposal DLMS4TEF, which
requirements are divided into hardware and software, as hardware will need
Fast-Ethernet (LAN) technology to connect the departments of the Foundation via
Client-Server network later, when an infrastructure is established for
e-governments or e-management, it may be extended to the campus network. The
software is represented by installing windows server to implement the proposal
design of DLMS4TEF, PHP script is used as web programming that supports the
server, where as the HTML and JavaScript are used to support the client side.
The dynamic DLMS4TEF will be based on relational database, which is created by
using MySQL, to support processing hundreds of queries per second, and the
Kurdish Unicode to support Kurdish fonts of GUI's, Moreover, for security
DLMS4TEF allows each department in the Foundation to enter its own section and
prevent accessing other sections by using HTAccessible program which allows the
user to access by using his IP address and his computer only. The important
conclusions and advantages of applying DLMS4TEF are making backup to DLMS4TEF's
databases using the option (zipped) which allows them to reach the size of (3%)
of the original database size, sufficient security techniques, through
achieving levels of security, hidden access to the administrator section, and
finally DLMS4TEF, when compared with the traditional methods and project of
Oman, shows the same efficiency of some, if not better, features of Oman.

"New Mobile technologies have created a new social dimension where individuals
can develop increased levels of their social awareness by keeping in touch with
old friends, making new friends, dispense new data or product, and getting
information in many more aspects of everyday lives, making one to become more
knowledgeable which is very beneficial especially for students. Social
networks, in particular enable users to share and discuss common interests and
provide infrastructures for integrating various user experiences: synchronous
and asynchronous communication, game-playing, sharing links and files. The
trend of using social networks and social media to deliver and exchange
knowledge could bring a new era of social learning in which learners make use
all four language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Unlike a
traditional e-leaning paradigm with pre-defined curriculum and standard
textbooks, social knowledge could be aggregated on demand, just in time, and in
context of engaging challenges from social networks, making learning more
exciting, social and, game-like experience. Social learning environment engages
the learners in discussion, collaboration, exploration, production, discovery
and creation. Schools should harness this to develop group collaboration skills
and even project based learning activities that span subjects and grade levels.
This paper focuses on technologies and avenues of using mobile phones in
supporting open social learning among undergraduate students in Nigeria."
"There is a multitude of licenses out there for a software developer to choose
from, but a lot of programmers would prefer to not have to have a legal degree
in order to understand them and would rather just have their code out in the
public being used. This paper examines a few of the more popular and common
software licenses available and compares their conditions from the perspective
that a developer wanted to scratch their proverbial itch, have their code be
used and maybe even get credit for it. This paper attempts to clarify which
license a developer would benefit from the most if they just want to have their
code used, have their name out there and not be sued if anything breaks."
"This paper is based on the study of existing literature, highlights the
current state of the work proposed to implement technically enhanced learning.
  Technology developments and network infrastructure improvements, specifically
the world wide web) are providing exciting opportunities for the use of
computers in all areas. These developments have fit together with an evolving
role for education as more students wish to study at a distance, part time, or
wish to integrate their education with their professional career. With the
market becoming increasingly mature, e learning has almost become a major plank
in both national and institutional strategies.
  At the same time, virtual learning system is also gaining its popularity
among its users. It has brought in a great revolution in itself. In the
advanced learning strategy, virtual learning systems depends on level and
sector of working, usage of functions, purpose of usage, required online
resources to perform computationally intensive operations such as information
sharing and collaborative work. Often the institutions prefer the latest and
the best technology which is cost effective and provide the best features which
meet up all requirements. Virtual learning environment enables operator
professional to bring together in one place a variety of prevailing resources,
suchlike tasks and formative feedback, and links to law reports, statutes and
journal articles, all intended at summing up value to student learning managing
learning experience without the burden of communication and providing
successful delivery of education and training with flexibility.
  In spite of the hype achieved by organizations in technically enhanced
learning, the growth of the virtual learning systems users is still below
expectations due to the risks associated with the implementation strategy and
provision of technical support."
"Education at all levels is facing several challenges in most countries, such
as low quality, high costs, lack of educators, and unsatisfied student demand.
Traditional approaches are becoming unable to deliver the required education.
Several causes for this inefficiency can be identified. I argue that beyond
specific causes, the lack of effective education is related to complexity.
However, information technology is helping us overcome this complexity."
"The research aims to develop an interactive instructional model using
augmented reality based on edutainment to enhance emotional quotient and
evaluate the model. Two phases of the research will be carried out: a
development and an evaluation of the model. Samples are experts in the field of

selected by purposive sampling method. The obtained data are analyzed using
mean and standard deviation. The research result demonstrates the following
findings: 1) The results of this research show that Model consists of 3
elements: IIAR, EduLA, and EQ. EQ is a means to assess EQ based on Time Series
Experimental Design using 2 kinds of tools; i.e. EQ Assessment by programs in
tablet computers, and EQ Assessment by behavioral observation. 2) The ten
experts have evaluated the model and commented that the developed model showed
high suitability."
"Reasons for contradictory findings regarding the gender moderate effect on
computer self-efficacy in the adoption of e-learning/mobile learning are
limited. Recognizing the multilevel nature of the computer self-efficacy (CSE),
this study attempts to explore gender differences in the adoption of mobile
learning, by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with general and
specific CSE. Data collected from 137 university students were tested against
the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results
suggest that there are significant gender differences in perceptions of general
CSE, perceived ease of use and behavioral intention to use but no significant
differences in specific CSE, perceived usefulness. Additionally, the findings
reveal that specific CSE is more salient than general CSE in influencing
perceived ease of use while general CSE seems to be the salient factor on
perceived usefulness for both female and male combined. Moreover, general CSE
was salient to determine the behavioral intention to use indirectly for female
despite lower perception of general CSE than male's, and specific CSE exhibited
stronger indirect effect on behavioral intention to use than general CSE for
female despite similar perception of specific CSE as males'. These findings
provide important implications for mobile learning adoption and usage."
"Much research has been conducted to investigate personality and daily
behavior of these only children ('Onlies') due to the Chinese

"The statistic of World Health Organization shows at one year about 287000
women died most of them during and following pregnancy and childbirth in Africa
and south Asia. This paper suggests system for serving pregnant women using
open source based on Android technology, the proposed system works based on
mobile GIS to select closest care centre or hospital maternity on Google map
for the pregnant woman, which completed an online registration by sending SMS
via GPRS network (or internet) contains her name and phone number and region
(Longitude and Latitude) and other required information the server will save
the information in server database then find the closest care centre and call
her for first review at the selected care centre, the proposed system allowed
the pregnant women from her location (home, market, etc) can send a help
request in emergency cases (via SMS by click one button) contains the ID for
this pregnant woman, and her coordinates (Longitude and Latitude) via GPRS
network, then the server will locate the pregnant on Google map and retrieve
the pregnant information from the database. This information will be used by
the server to send succoring to pregnant woman at her location and at the same
time notify the nearest hospital and moreover, the server will send SMS over IP
to inform her husband and the hospital doctors. Implement and applied this
proposed system of pregnant women shows more effective cost than other systems
because it works in economic mode (SMS), and the services of proposed system
are flexible (open source platform) as well as rapidly (mobile GIS based on

"The present article shows the results of a survey aimed at identifying the
informational abilities of Havana University students. Several methods such as
the survey, expert's interviews and content and document analysis are used. The
questionnaire has been structured base on three basic variables: information

identification of these abilities was a key element for guiding libraries in
the development of actions focused on their communities."
"Human brain activity collected in the form of Electroencephalography (EEG),
even with low number of sensors, is an extremely rich signal. Traces collected
from multiple channels and with high sampling rates capture many important
aspects of participants' brain activity and can be used as a unique personal
identifier. The motivation for sharing EEG signals is significant, as a mean to
understand the relation between brain activity and well-being, or for
communication with medical services. As the equipment for such data collection
becomes more available and widely used, the opportunities for using the data
are growing; at the same time however inherent privacy risks are mounting. The
same raw EEG signal can be used for example to diagnose mental diseases, find
traces of epilepsy, and decode personality traits. The current practice of the
informed consent of the participants for the use of the data either prevents
reuse of the raw signal or does not truly respect participants' right to
privacy by reusing the same raw data for purposes much different than
originally consented to. Here we propose an integration of a personal
neuroinformatics system, Smartphone Brain Scanner, with a general privacy
framework openPDS. We show how raw high-dimensionality data can be collected on
a mobile device, uploaded to a server, and subsequently operated on and
accessed by applications or researchers, without disclosing the raw signal.
Those extracted features of the raw signal, called answers, are of
significantly lower-dimensionality, and provide the full utility of the data in
given context, without the risk of disclosing sensitive raw signal. Such
architecture significantly mitigates a very serious privacy risk related to raw
EEG recordings floating around and being used and reused for various purposes."
"The transfer of the medical care services to the patient, rather than the
transport of the patient to the medical services providers is aim of the
project. This is achieved by using web-based applications including Modern
Medical Informatics Services which is easier, faster and less expensive. The
required system implements the suitable informatics and electronics solutions
efficiently for the Tele-medicine care. We proposed an approach to manage
different multimedia medical databases in the telemedicine system. In order to
be efficiently and effectively manage, search, and display database
information, we define an information package for both of doctor and patient as
a concise data set of their medical information from each visit. The
methodology for accessing various types of medical records will be provided,
also we will design two web-based interfaces, high-quality data and display for
many medical service purposes."
"Mobile applications have been rapidly changing the way business organizations
deliver their services to their customers and how customers can interact with
their service providers in order to satisfy their needs. The use of mobile
applications increases rapidly, and has been used in many segments including
banking segment. This research aims at extending the Technology Adoption Model
(TAM) to incorporate the role of factors in influencing customers perception
towards mobile banking adoption. Furthermore, the extended TAM model was
evaluated empirically to measure its impact on m-banking adoption in of
Bahrain. The model was evaluated using a sample survey of 372 customers. The
results reveal that the intention to adopt mobile banking is mainly affected by
specific factors which are: Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use. On the other
hand, some factors such as perceived cost and perceived risk did not show any
affect on the users' intention to use mobile banking. The result of this
research is beneficial for banking service managers to consider the factors
that can enforce the Mobile Banking services adoption and increase the take-up
of their mobile services."
"Remote home management is one of the developing areas in current technology.
In this paper we described how to manage and control home appliances using
mobile phone, people can use this system to do things in their home from a far
place before they reach home. For instance, user may start his/her room cooler
or heater so that before they reach home the condition in the room will be
conducive, also appliances like washing machine and cooker can be started and
if the time taken for this appliances to perform a task is known that can also
be set, so that if the time elapsed the appliance will automatically switch off
itself. To control an appliance the user sends a command in form of SMS from
his/her mobile phone to a computer which is connected to the appliance, once
the message is received the computer will send the command to a microcontroller
for controlling the appliance appropriately."
"In recent years, the amount of information collected about human beings has
increased dramatically. This development has been partially driven by
individuals posting and storing data about themselves and friends using online
social networks or collecting their data for self-tracking purposes
(quantified-self movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies
collecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale. Using computational
power combined with mathematical models, such rich datasets can be mined to
infer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature. Much
of the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most
individuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data
publicly. For this reason, the need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the
individuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection efforts.
Out of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts
directly instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the
privacy of participants is not sufficiently addressed. For example, study
purposes are often not explicit, informed consent is ill-defined, and security
and sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides a
survey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies
that collect detailed sensor data on human behavior. Reflections on the key
problems and recommendations for future work are included. We hope the overview
of the privacy-related practices in massive data collection studies can be used
as a frame of reference for practitioners in the field. Although focused on
data collection in an academic context, we believe that many of the challenges
and solutions we identify are also relevant and useful for other domains where
massive data collection takes place, including businesses and governments."

"Although Information Systems and Information Technology (IS & IT) has become
a major driving force for many of the current day organizations, the NGOs have
not been able to utilize the benefits up to a satisfactory level. Most
organizations use standard office tools to manage huge amount for field data
and never feel the need for a central repository of data. While many people
argue that an NGO should not spend too much money on information management, it
is a fact that organizing the information requires more of a mindset and an
organized behavior than a huge financial investment."
"Many people hold a vision that big data will provide big insights and have a
big impact in the future, and big-data-assisted scientific discovery is seen as
an emerging and promising scientific paradigm. However, how to turn big data
into deep insights with tremendous value still remains obscure. To meet the
challenge, universal knowledge discovery from big data (UKD) is proposed. The
new concept focuses on discovering universal knowledge, which exists in the
statistical analyses of big data and provides valuable insights into big data.
Universal knowledge comes in different forms, e.g., universal patterns, rules,
correlations, models and mechanisms. To accelerate big data assisted universal
knowledge discovery, a unified research paradigm should be built based on
techniques and paradigms from related research domains, especially big data
mining and complex systems science. Therefore, I propose an iBEST@SEE
methodology. This study lays a solid foundation for the future development of
universal knowledge discovery, and offers a pathway to the discovery of
""treasure-trove"" hidden in big data."
"This paper has a specific objective of being useful for showing how the
advances in mobile technologies can help for solving social and political
aspects involved in the reform of subsidies in developing countries. It
describes the work done to build a mobile-based supportive network that
integrates all subsidies partners: governmental, non-governmental
organizations, merchants, and beneficiaries. One main contribution of this work
is the setting of a framework for identifying the requirements of subsidies
distribution information systems. In the proposed approach, seven domains were
identified to build a Mobile Subsidizing Business Model (MSBM). Based on MSBM,
detailed requirements were gathered in three stages, with each having its
appropriate methodology. In this work, we focus on the layered architecture
implementation of the subsidizing mobile system to breakdown the complexities,
which are due to variations of mobile technologies, different business rules,
and multiple distribution scenarios."
"A rich body of work in recent years has advocated the use of cloud
technologies within a home environment, but nothing has materialized so far in
terms of real-world implementations. In this paper, we argue that this is due
to the fact that none of these proposals have addressed some of the practical
challenges of moving home applications to the cloud. Specifically, we discuss
the pragmatic implications of moving to the cloud including, data and
information security, increase in network traffic, and fault tolerance. To
elicit discussion, we take a clean-slate approach and introduce a
proof-of-concept smart home, dubbed Clome, that decouples non-trivial
computation from home applications and transfers it to the cloud. We also
discuss how a Clome-like smart home with decentralized processing and storage
can be enabled through OpenFlow programmable switches, home-centric programming
platforms, and thin-client computing."
"Persuasion is part and parcel of human interaction. The human persuaders in
society have been always exit, masters of rhetoric skilled of changing our
minds, or at least our behaviors. Leaders, mothers, salesmen, and teachers are
clear examples of persuaders. Persuaders often turn to technology and digital
media to amplify their persuasive ends. Besides, our lives and how we lead them
influenced by technologies and digital media,but for the most part, their
effects on our attitudes and behaviors have been incidental, even accidental.
Although, nowadays, the use of computers to sell products and services
considered as the most frequent application of persuasive technology. In this
short paper, based on an extensive review of literatures, we aim to give a
brief introduction to persuasive technology, and how it can play a role and
contribute to enhance and deliver the best practice of IT. Some challenges of
persuasive technology have been discussed. At the end, some recommendations and
steps should be taken place to empower IT professional practices have been
listed."
"The term knowledge management (KM) first came to prominence in the late
1990s. Although initially dismissed as a fad, KM continues to be featured in
articles concerning business productivity and innovation. And yet, clear-cut
examples that demonstrate the success of KM are few and far between. A brief
examination of the history of KM explores the reasons for this and looks at
some of the assumptions about what KM can achieve. A subsequent analysis of the
experiences of Infosys with KM shows that for KM to be successful,
organizational leaders need to engage in a continuous process of modification
and maintenance. Although KM initiatives can be made to yield worthwhile
returns over an extended period, there are often substantial ongoing costs
associated with them."
"Computer-based information systems feature in almost every aspect of our
lives, and yet most of us receive handwritten prescriptions when we visit our
doctors and rely on paper-based medical records in our healthcare. Although
electronic health record (EHR) systems have long been promoted as a
cost-effective and efficient alternative to this situation, clear-cut evidence
of their success has not been forthcoming. An examination of some of the
underlying problems that prevent EHR systems from delivering the benefits that
their proponents tout identifies four broad objectives - reducing cost,
reducing errors, improving coordination and improving adherence to standards -
and shows that they are not always met. The three possible causes for this
failure to deliver involve problems with the codification of knowledge, group
and tacit knowledge, and coordination and communication. There is, however,
reason to be optimistic that EHR systems can fulfil a healthy part, if not all,
of their potential."
"The ubiquity of technology in our daily lives and the economic stability of
the technology sector in recent years, especially in areas with a computer
science footing, has led to an increase in computer science enrollment in many
parts of the world. To keep up with this trend, the undergraduate computer
science curriculum has undergone many revisions, analysis, and discussion.
Unfortunately, the graduate level curriculum is lagging far behind in computer
science education literature and research. To remedy this, we present the
blueprint and execution of a graduate level course in programming, designed
specifically to cater to the needs of graduate students with a diverse
background both in CS and other fields. To this end, the course is divided into
two halves. In the first half, students are introduced to different programming
concepts, such as multi-paradigm programming, data structures, concurrency, and
security to bring them up to speed and provide a level playing field. In the
second half, all of these concepts are employed as building blocks to solve
real-world problems from data mining, natural language processing, computer
vision, and other fields. In addition, the paper also discusses in detail the
evaluation instruments employed for the course. Moreover, we also share
anecdotal information around student feedback, course design, and grading that
may be useful for others who wish to replicate our curriculum or sketch a
similar course."
"A number of recent efforts aim to bridge the global digital divide,
particularly with respect to Internet access. We take this endeavor one step
further and argue that Internet access and web security go hand in glove in the
developing world. To remedy the situation, we explore whether low-cost
platforms, such as Raspberry Pi (\$35) and Cubieboard (\$59), can be used to
implement security mechanisms. Using a firewall as a motivating security
application we benchmark its performance on these platforms to test our thesis.
Our results show that these platforms can indeed serve as enablers of security
functions for small sized deployments in the developing world, while only
consuming less than $2.5 worth of electricity per device per annum. In
addition, we argue that the use of these platforms also addresses maintenance
challenges such as update roll-out and distribution. Furthermore, a number of
additional network functions, such as caching and WAN acceleration can also be
implemented atop this simple infrastructure. Finally, we posit that this
deployment can be used for in-network monitoring to facilitate ICT4D research."
"It is a common phenomenon for many mature female international students
enrolled in high education overseas to experience strain from managing
conflicting roles of student and family, and difficulties of cross-cultural
adjustment. The purpose of this study is to examine perceptions and behavioral
intentions of international female students towards e-learning as a tool for
resolving overseas high education and family strain from a technology
acceptance standpoint. To achieve this goal, Davis's (1989) technology
acceptance model is used as the study's conceptual framework, to investigate
perceived usefulness, ease of use and behavioral intentions towards e-learning.
The research draws on face-to-face interviews with 21 female international
students enrolled in classroom taught degree programs at a university in Wuhan,
China. The data is analyzed through coding and transcribing. The findings
reveal that given its convenience, e-learning is generally perceived as
practical in balancing study with family as well as feasible in saving time,
money and energy. However, key concerns were raised over the issues of poor and
costly Internet connectivity in developing countries, as well as perceived
negative reputation, lack of face-to-face interaction and lack of motivation in
online environment. Important issues and recommendations are raised for
consideration when promoting e-learning programme. This study emphasis on the
need to revisit gender supporting policies and effective marketing to
re-position the prevailing image of e-learning as a reputable and reliable
education delivery method."
"One of the most significant developments in the history of human being is the
invention of a way of keeping records of human knowledge, thoughts and ideas.
In 1926, the work of several thinkers such as Edouard Le Roy, Vladimir
Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin led to the concept of noosphere, thus the
idea that human cognition and knowledge transforms the biosphere coming to be
something like the planet's thinking layer. At present, is commonly accepted by
some thinkers that the Internet is the medium that brings life to noosphere.
According to Vinge and Kurzweil's technological singularity hypothesis,
noosphere would be in the future the natural environment in which
'human-machine superintelligence' emerges after to reach the point of
technological singularity. In this paper we show by means of a numerical model
the impossibility that our civilization reaches the point of technological
singularity in the near future. We propose that this point may be reached when
Internet data centers are based on ""computer machines"" to be more effective in
terms of power consumption than current ones. We speculate about what we have
called 'Nooscomputer' or N-computer a hypothetical machine which would consume
far less power allowing our civilization to reach the point of technological
singularity."
"Career progression is a general concern of professional working mothers in
China. The purpose of this paper is to report a qualitative study of Chinese
professional working mothers that explored the perceptions of online Master's
of Business Administration (MBA) programmes as a tool for career progression
for working mothers balancing work and family in China. The objective was to
examine existing work-family and career progression conflicts, the perceived
usefulness of online MBA in balancing work-family and career aspirations, and
the perceived ease of use of e-learning. Using Davis's (1989) technology
acceptance model (TAM), the research drew on in-depth interviews with 10 female
part-time MBA students from a university in Wuhan. The data were analysed
through coding and transcribing. The findings showed that conflicts arose where
demanding work schedules competed with family obligations, studies, and caring
for children and the elderly. Online MBA programmes were viewed as a viable
tool for balancing work and family and studying, given its flexible time
management capabilities. However, consideration must be given to address
students' motivation issues, lack of networking, lack of face-to-face
interaction, and quality. The research findings emphasise the pragmatic need to
re-align higher education policy and practice to position higher education
e-learning as a trustable education delivery channel in China. By shedding
light on the prevailing work-family conflict experienced by women seeking
career advancement, this study suggests developing better gender-supporting
policies and innovative e-learning practices to champion online MBA programme
for this target niche."
"Dengue is a notifiable communicable disease in Sri Lanka since 1996. Dengue
fever spread rapidly among people living in most of the districts of Sri Lanka.
The present notification system of dengue communicable diseases which is
enforced by law is a passive surveillance system carried out by the public
health care professionals. The present notification of communicable disease
system is manual, slow, inefficient, and repetitive all of these lead to handle
the dengue related health problems ineffectively. Thus it is less effective in
preventing a spreading epidemic, public health care professionals and others
require an operational support system to help for managing day-to-day public
health responsibilities as well as a method to effectively detect and manage
health problems such as Dengue. On the other hand the Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) in medical world has been widely used. To give
the information technology touch, a complementary web based open source
software application environment has been developed with minimum implementation
and recurrent costs critical for developing countries like Sri Lanka and named
as eDCS: e Dengue Control System based on the same principles of manual disease
surveillance system while taking steps to provide timely, accurate information
in a reliable and useable manner. The eDCS helps to manage outbreaks through
early detection, rapid verification, and appropriate response to Dengue. It
allows health care professionals and citizens to get early awareness about the
dengue disease via Internet or mobile phone and bring them for performing
Dengue prevention and controlling operation through the social media
acceleration. The system is initially limited to dengue communicable disease.
It can be easily expanded to other communicable diseases, and non communicable
disease surveillance in future."
"A hard-fork reconfiguration of the peer to peer Bitcoin network is described
that substitutes tamper-evident logs and proof-of-stake consensus for
proof-of-work consensus. The block creation rewards and transaction fees are
reallocated to establish and staff a secure financial data network capable of
handling the world's transactions with subsecond response time. The new system
pays dividends to stake-offering bitcoin holders. In contrast to Satoshi
Nakamoto's mesh network consisting of competing peers, this system uses an
enterprise class network that is efficient, robust, and scalable, consisting of
cooperating peers. The network backbone nodes host trustless nomadic agents.
Thousands of distributed full nodes are paid to replicate a singleton
blockchain built upon every 10 minutes by a nomadic mint agent whose actions
are verified by its peers. This arrangement enables immediate acknowledgment to
an issuing node that its transaction has been accepted. Less effort means that
subsidized transaction costs will be lower. Network reconfiguration enables the
processing of numerous microtransactions. Stake-weighted distributed consensus
is achieved when necessary with less than one-half arbitrarily faulty nodes.
Important invariants of the Satoshi Social Contract between core developers and
users are maintained: The reward schedule, the blockchain format, the fixed
number of bitcoins, and the decentralized, trustless protocol are untouched.
The system remains a global distributed database, with additions to the
database by consent of the majority, based on a set of transparent rules they
follow."
"This article reports on an exploratory case study conducted to examine the
viability of Second Life (SL) as an environment for physical simulations and
microworlds. It begins by discussing specific features of the SL environment
relevant to its use as a support for microworlds and simulations as well as a
few differences found between SL and traditional simulators such as Modellus,
along with their implications to simulations, as a support for subsequent
analysis. Afterwards, we will use Narayanasamy et al. and Johnston and
Whitehead criteria to analyze the SL environment and determine into which of
training simulators, games, simulation games, or serious games categories SL
fits best. We conclude that SL shows itself as a huge and sophisticated
simulator of an entire Earthlike world used by thousands of users to simulate
real life in some sense and a viable and flexible platform for microworlds and
simulations."
"The study aims to identify the possibilities offered by academic studies in
Cuba for the training of information professionals as marketing managers. A
theoretical analysis is conducted of the basic functions of marketing and its
information dimension, the specific features of the work of the marketing
manager, and the competencies developed by Curriculum D in information science
graduates in the Cuban context. Based on the analysis of curricular contents
and interviews with ten information professionals working as marketing
managers, determination was made of some indispensable competencies which
should be developed during the training and later on during service practice."
"Speech therapy consists in a wide range of services whose aim is to prevent,
diagnose and treat different types of speech impairments. One of the most
important conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the
""immersing"" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at
home, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to
become habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of
human SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main
distinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based
Speech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The
inability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to
inadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this ""unresponsive"" behaviour is
perceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children,
leads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we
propose an original emotions recognition framework - named PhonEM - to be
integrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon. The originality consists
in both emotions representation (a fuzzy model) and detection (using only
subjects' speech stream). These exceptional restrictions along with the fuzzy
representation of emotions lie at the origin of our approach and make our task
a difficult and, in the same time, an innovative one. As far as we know, this
is the first attempt to combine these techniques in order to improve assisted
speech therapy and the obtained results encourage as to further develop our
CBST."
"In this paper we present a consistent set of exercises for children with
dyslalia (dyslalia is a speech disorder that affect pronunciation of one ore
many sounds). The achievement has gone from ""Therapeutic Guide"" made available
by the team of researchers led by Professor Mrs. Iolanda TOBOLCEA from the
""Alexandru Ioan Cuza"" University of Iasi. The specifications of the
""Therapeutic Guide"" have been fully complied with, such exercises being adapted
both age and level of children. To achieve these exercises were recorded,
processed and used more than 10000 voice production. They also have been made
over the 2000 corresponding recorded nouns. These exercises are being tested by
Interschool Regional Logopaedic Center of Suceava - Romania."
"The growth of Internet has led to new approaches for distance education. The
main mechanisms involved in this process are distance learning and distance
evaluation. Distance learning have multiple forms, from browsing and finding
information when needed or collecting information onto ready-to-use packages,
to interactive content where the learner is able to affect and control the
content in some way. From the teacher's point of view, evaluation of learning
aims to determine whether the students have achieved the goals set for a
particular topic or course. Typically this is tested somehow and based on the
test results, evaluation is performed. This kind of method is always restricted
to the test, however. Many times the students may actually learn something
completely different from those that are tested. Furthermore, testing does not
necessarily take the students' individual needs into account. However, when
properly designed, the testing method is a practical and even fairly reliable
way of evaluating learning."
"This article describes the recognition part of a system that will be used for
personalized therapy of dyslalia affecting pre scholars. Dyslalia is a speech
disorder that affect pronunciation of one ore many sounds. The full system
targets interdisciplinary research (computer science, psychology, electronics)
- having as main objective the development of methods, models, algorithms,
System on Chip architectures with regards to the elaboration and implementation
of a complete system addressing the therapy of dyslalia affecting pre scholars,
in a personalized and user centered manner. The system addresses the number of
10% of children with age between 4 and 7 that, according to the statistics,
present different variations of speech impairments. Although these impairments
do not create major difficulties concerning common communication, it has been
noticed that problems are likely to appear affecting negatively the child's
personality as well as his social environment."
"Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia is a leading producer of oil and natural
gas, a member of G-20, has the largest and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces
in the Arab region, and is very wealthy, online retailing activities are not
progressing at the same speed as its growing ICT marketplace. For this reason,
the attitudes of retailers in companies at different stages of e-commerce
maturity were investigated to determine what factors are causing this problem.
The data collection included two stages: first, interviews with 16 retailers
and, then, based on the outcomes of the interviews, a quantitative study
designed to test and further explore the qualitative interview findings with a
sample of 153 retailers in companies at different stages of e-commerce
maturity. The results showed striking differences between retailers as a
function of the stage of growth of their companies in regard to factors
relating to their perceptions of consumers and to organizational factors. At
the same time, the results showed agreement between retailers in companies at
different stages in relation to environmental factors. The investigation helped
to identify the incentives and barriers for each stage of maturity and makes
recommendations of what could be done to help companies move from one stage to
the next."
"This study is to investigate the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of the
Business to Customer (B2C) e-commerce system. These factors should be
considered comprehensively and expanded to all parties concerned to create and

to give an organized and inclusive view of the CSFs, an enterprise architecture
framework will be adopted to systemize this investigation."
"More than ever, social networks have become an important place in the
interaction and behaviour of humans in the last decade. This valuable position
makes it imperative to analyze different aspects of everyday life and science
in general. This paper illustrates the process of capturing and storing
information, the application of density-based clustering and improved nearest
neighbor, and a review of the results. The study also shows the elements used
in the identification of areas of interest through clusters, circumferences and
coverage radii obtained for a demographic segmentation analysis of the
information procured from Twitter, Flickr and the like. This results in more
profound conclusions about a predefined topic or theme. Finally, the need
arises to develop an application that makes all the defined process automatic,
allowing final users interested in those topics to have access to it and get
important results for their organizations or interest."
"Computer science enrollments have started to rise again, but the percentage
of women undergraduates in computer science is still low. Some studies indicate
this might be due to a lack of awareness of computer science at the high school
level. We present our experiences running a 5-year, high school outreach
program that introduces information about computer science within the context
of required chemistry courses. We developed interactive worksheets using
Molecular Workbench that help the students learn chemistry and computer science
concepts related to relevant events such as the gulf oil spill. Our evaluation
of the effectiveness of this approach indicates that the students do become
more aware of computer science as a discipline, but system support issues in
the classroom can make the approach difficult for teachers and discouraging for
the students."
"Today e-waste are becoming a major problem for the developing countries.
E-waste is defined something as a discarded parts of electronic devices which
contains most of the times, hazardous chemicals which is deadly for our
environment, example is computer components. Green Computing is the study and
practice of designing, using, disposing and manufacturing electronic components
in an eco-friendly manner and Green Computing is one of the solution to tackle
with this hazardous e-waste problem which is an emerging concern towards the
environment. The objective of this paper is to draw the attention towards the
lack of awareness about green computing or we can say how green computing
policies is being ignored by developing countries and how developed countries
are adopting green IT policies seriously. This paper also discusses the
analysis which has been done on how the amount of e-waste has been increased in
developing countries in past years"
"This paper reviews multi-disciplinary research on information systems
supporting the physical wellbeing of the elderly population. By taking a
systematic approach, it screens journals, conference proceedings and books on
how computer-based systems are used for improving both the health and wellbeing
of the most senior individuals. By using different Internet-databases indexing
academic publications and a set of conceptual keywords the authors searched for
and identified 62 major publications on the topic that were carefully reviewed.
Each publication item was classified according different category sets and the
aggregated data was then analyzed from different socio-technological
perspectives. Our findings suggest that research on the topic is very focused
on diseases over health and wellbeing, since most of the studied information
systems focused much more on the protective and curative medical procedures
over other important dimensions such as prevention, education and health
promotion. An overview on what and where the studied systems are used is
presented and a new information systems research agenda is proposed."
"This paper represents the overview of the influence of internet governance in
all the transactions, trading, business, social services, educational
activities, research etc. occurring through the internet. It is very essential
to implement laws and regulations in the field wherever the transaction takes
place, either in the form of money, material or services. To avoid any kind of
fraud and cheating and to establish a peaceful environment in physical as well
as virtual word, it is essential to have some organization which assures safety
and security. Here I-governance is the governing body that tries to take care
of all those requirements."
"Each month, more attacks are launched with the aim of making web users
believe that they are communicating with a trusted entity which compels them to
share their personal, financial information. Phishing costs Internet users
billions of dollars every year. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
created an anti-phishing landing page supported by Anti-Phishing Working Group
(APWG) with the aim to train users on how to prevent themselves from phishing
attacks. It is used by financial institutions, phish site take down vendors,
government organizations, and online merchants. When a potential victim clicks
on a phishing link that has been taken down, he / she is redirected to the
landing page. In this paper, we present the comparative analysis on two
datasets that we obtained from APWG's landing page log files; one, from
September 7, 2008 - November 11, 2009, and other from January 1, 2014 - April
30, 2014. We found that the landing page has been successful in training users
against phishing. Forty six percent users clicked lesser number of phishing
URLs from January 2014 to April 2014 which shows that training from the landing
page helped users not to fall for phishing attacks. Our analysis shows that
phishers have started to modify their techniques by creating more legitimate
looking URLs and buying large number of domains to increase their activity. We
observed that phishers are exploiting ICANN accredited registrars to launch
their attacks even after strict surveillance. We saw that phishers are trying
to exploit free subdomain registration services to carry out attacks. In this
paper, we also compared the phishing e-mails used by phishers to lure victims
in 2008 and 2014. We found that the phishing e-mails have changed considerably
over time. Phishers have adopted new techniques like sending promotional
e-mails and emotionally targeting users in clicking phishing URLs."
"Social media as a trend in the Internet is now used as a medium for political
campaigns. Author explores the advantages and social media implementation of

"Clustering is a powerful tool which has been used in several forecasting
works, such as time series forecasting, real time storm detection, flood
forecasting and so on. In this paper, a generic methodology for weather
forecasting is proposed by the help of incremental K-means clustering
algorithm. Weather forecasting plays an important role in day to day
applications.Weather forecasting of this paper is done based on the incremental
air pollution database of west Bengal in the years of 2009 and 2010. This paper
generally uses typical K-means clustering on the main air pollution database
and a list of weather category will be developed based on the maximum mean
values of the clusters.Now when the new data are coming, the incremental
K-means is used to group those data into those clusters whose weather category
has been already defined. Thus it builds up a strategy to predict the weather
of the upcoming data of the upcoming days. This forecasting database is totally
based on the weather of west Bengal and this forecasting methodology is
developed to mitigating the impacts of air pollutions and launch focused
modeling computations for prediction and forecasts of weather events. Here
accuracy of this approach is also measured."
"In this paper, we are proposing new web based Student Annual Review
Information System (SARIS) and prediction method for the success of scholar
students to China Scholarship Council(CSC). The main objective of developing
this system is to save the cost of paper, to reduce the risk of data loss, to
decrease the processing time, to reduce the delay in finding for the successful
students. The proposed system and prediction method is intended to be used by
China Scholarship Council; however SARIS and prediction method are quite
generic and can be used by other scholarship agencies."
"In this paper we present our researches regarding automat parsing of audio
recordings. These recordings are obtained from children with dyslalia and are
necessary for an accurate identification of speech problems. We develop the ADM
algorithm and we analyze the complexity of this solution. We utilize a digital
voice recorder in High Quality mode and with VCVA (Variable Control Voice
Actuator) activated. The record format is IMA-ADPCM, 16KHz and 4bits (16 bits
PCM). A microphone was placed at 10 cm from mouth in order to minimize
environment noise. A software set of classes (C#) was created for handling
audio stream (read, conversion between different format, write). We also
propose an original solution for placing markers in audio stream. These markers
are needed for a correct parsing af full recoding."
"The information technology applications in cyberspace (the internet) are
currently dominated by social media. The author investigates and explores the
advantages of social media implementation of any political party in Indonesian
general legislative elections 2014. There are twelve national political parties
participating in the election as contestants plus three local political parties
in Aceh. In this research, author focus on national political parties only. The
author visited, analyzed, and learnt the social media used by the contestants.
Those social media are : 1) Facebook, 2) Twitter, and 3) YouTube. Author also
compares the popularity of political parties on social media with the results
of a real count. Then Author can discuss : 1) the impact of social media on
political parties, 2) social media as a brand of political parties, 3) social
media as political presentation, and 4) social media as virtual society. The
results of this study indicate that Facebook is still a social media
application that received high attention by the voters on a campaign of
political parties. Indonesian's legislative elections won by parties that are
using social media as part of their campaigns."
"Smart city [1] planning is crucial as it should balance among resources and
the needs of the city .It allows to achieve good eco-friendly industries, there
by supporting both the nature and the stake holders. Setting up an industry is
a difficult problem, because it should optimize the resources and allocating it
in an effective manner. Weighted sum approach [2] uses the spatial data for
finding appropriate places to set up the industry based on the weight assigned
to each constraint. The user can predict the possible places in the search
space, where the industry can be set with low time complexity using spatial
data. Diversity being introduced by using multipoint crossover and mutation
operations. It will help to bring exploration in the search space, thereby
bring the diversity factor into the solution space. The prediction approach
will help to avoid the human exploitation on nature for resources. This in turn
helps the investors to maximize the Return on Investment (ROI)."
"This paper examines the state of Open Data in Latvia at the middle of 2014.
The study is divided into two parts: (i) a survey of open data situation and
(ii) an overview of available open data sets. The first part examines the
general open data climate in Latvia according to the guidelines of the OKFN
Open Data Index making the results comparable to those of other participants of
this index. The second part examines datasets made available on the Latvia Open
Data community catalogue, the only open data catalogue available in Latvia at
the moment. We conclude that Latvia public sector open data mostly fulfil the
basic criteria (e.g., data is available) of the Open Data Index but fail on
more advanced criteria: the majority of data considered in the study are not
published in machine-readable form, are not available for bulk download and
none of the data sources have open license statements."
"By the increasing spread of information technology and Internet improvements,
most of the large-scale companies are paying special attention to their
reputation on many types of the information and communication technology. The
increasing developments and penetration of new technologies into daily life,
brings out paradigm shift on the perception of reputation and creates new
concepts like esocieties, techno-culture and new media. Contemporary companies
are trying to control their reputation over the new communities who are mostly
interacting with social networks, web pages and electronic communication
technologies. In this study, the reputation of top 30 Turkish companies, quoted
to the Istanbul Stock Market, is studied, based on the information technology
interfaces between company and society, such as social networks, blogs, wikis
and web pages. The web reputation is gathered through 17 different parameters,
collected from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Bing, Alexa, etc. The reputation
index is calculated by z-index and fscoring formulations after the min-max
normalization of each web reputation parameter."
"This paper reports on the outcomes of a survey implemented in secondary
schools. The survey identified the types of access and use of computers by
students. It was found that the students had significant access to computers
but they were not skilled in many features of computer use. Computers were used
for a range of activities, some educational and others recreational by some
students. Gender differences in computer use were not seen. The study
highlights the changing scenario about uses of computer technology by students."
"Crisis Communication is an effective communication mechanism in the world.
The outbreak of the SARS disease and the way information on it was disseminated
has illustrated the importance of effective and efficient crisis communication
management. Consequently, we would like to highlight the viability of
incorporating an intelligent agent software robot into a crisis communication
portal (CCNet) to send the alert news to subscribed users via email and others
mobile services such as SMS, MMS and GPRS."
"Recently, it has been proposed to analyse the literary works, plays or
novels, using graphs to display the social network of their interacting
characters. In this approach, the timeline of the literary work is lost,
because the storyline is projected on a planar graph. However, timelines can be
used to build some time series and analyse the work by means of vectors and
matrices. These series can be used to describe the presence and relevance, not
only of words in the text, but also of persons and places portrayed in the
drama or novel. In this framework, we discuss here an approach with
co-occurrence matrices plotted over time, concerning the presence of characters
in the pages of a novel. These matrices are similar to those appearing in
recurrence plots."
"As the technology continuous to advance new technologies have emerged with
the capability to revolutionize knowledge sharing practices. Web 2.0
exemplifies such new technologies which provides dynamic way of interactions of
people and businesses. In learning environment Web 2.0 technologies support and
enhance teaching and learning of students. Therefore the main aim of this study
focuses on the determining the ways to encourage knowledge sharing through web
2.0 technologies from students' point of views. A total of 287 students
responded to the online questionnaire in International Islamic University
Malaysia. Descriptive statistics was used in data analysis. The results show
that students used web 2.0 technologies in learning and sharing knowledge among
them. In addition the study found eight items on ways to encourage and enhance
knowledge sharing among students in the University. These items include Create
Awareness Provide facilities Internet Accessibility Ease of use Encourage
Teamwork Materials Availability Improved Responses and Motivation."
"The focus of this article are issues related to the assessment of the
teacher, working in small schools. The author analyzes the educational
activities ungraded school teacher, as one of the factors increasing the
quality of teaching in a rural school. We have tried to consider other
resources to successfully solve the problem of increasing the quality of
education in rural schools. Teacher in a rural school is a key figure in the
training, development and education of children. From his profession,
qualification, ability to work with a small but different age student
population is entirely dependent and learning outcomes of students. Therefore,
the educational activities of teachers of small schools should be analyzed and
monitored not only for assessing his work, but with the aim to provide all
possible assistance in the specific conditions of ungraded schools."
"The principles of open collaboration for innovation (and production), once
distinctive to open source software, are now found in many other ventures. Some
of these ventures are internet-based: Wikipedia, online forums and communities.
Others are off-line: in medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures
have been affecting traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational
form. Despite the impact of such ventures, questions remain about their
operating principles and performance. Here we define open collaboration (OC),
the underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for
innovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify
four defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and
services of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other's work, they
labor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to
contribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other
organizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to
performance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational
model, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation.
We identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the
cooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree
to which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments,
we find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when
cooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or
goods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new
domains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms,
collaborative and communal."
"Many celebrate the Internet's ability to connect individuals and facilitate
collective action toward a common goal. While numerous systems have been
designed to support particular aspects of collective action, few systems
support participatory, end-to-end collective action in which a crowd or
community identifies opportunities, formulates goals, brainstorms ideas,
develops plans, mobilizes, and takes action. To explore the possibilities and
barriers in supporting such interactions, we have developed WeDo, a system
aimed at promoting simple forms of participatory, end-to-end collective action.
Pilot deployments of WeDo illustrate that sociotechnical systems can support
automated transitions through different phases of end-to-end collective action,
but that challenges, such as the elicitation of leadership and the
accommodation of existing group norms, remain."
"The concept of local e-Government has become a key factor for delivering
services in an efficient, cost effective, transparent and convenient way, in
circumstances where a) citizens do not have enough time available to
communicate with local authorities in order to perform their responsibilities
and needs, and b) information and communication technologies significantly
facilitate administrative procedures and citizens-government interaction. This
paper aims to identify e-services that local authorities provide, and to
investigate their readiness for delivering these services. A pilot research has
been conducted to identify the offer of e-services by local authorities, along
with e-readiness in municipalities of the Pelagonia region in the Republic of
Macedonia. The survey was carried out by means of structured interview
questions based on a modified model proposed by Partnership on Measuring ICT
for Development - web analysis of municipal websites in the region has been
conducted, as well. The study reveals uneven distribution according to the age
group of users, lack of reliability and confidence for processing the needs and
requests electronically by a large part of the population, and improperly
developed set of ICT tools by local governments for providing a variety of
services that can be fully processed electronically."
"In this work, we present a high-level computational model of IT-mediated
crowds for collective intelligence. We introduce the Crowd Capital perspective
as an organizational-level model of collective intelligence generation from
IT-mediated crowds, and specify a computational system including agents, forms
of IT, and organizational knowledge."
"The smart shower is an intelligent device that saves the water during the
shower. It uses the indicator lamps that inform the user of the amount of the
water. Like the traffic signal it has three sets of lamps, green, yellow and
red, each indicating the amount of time spent. This device brain is the Siemens

"In this paper; a comparison has been made among the Articles contained in the
ISO/IEC 27001 Standard and the Articles of the Civil Servants Law No 657, which
should essentially be complied with by the personnel employed within the bodies
of public institutions in Turkey; and efforts have been made in order to
emphasize the consistent Articles; and in addition, the matters, which should
be paid attention by the public institutions indenting to obtain the ISO/IEC
27001 certificate for the Articles of the Civil Servants Law No 657 which are
not consistent with the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process, have been
mentioned. Furthermore, solution offers have been presented in order to ensure
that the mentioned Articles become consistent with the ISO/IEC 27001
certification process."
"Strategic alignment is a conviction that is considered extremely important in
understanding how organizations can apply their arrangement of information
technology (IT) into substantial boosts in achievement. To attain alignment
advantage, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) prepares a
framework of best practice approach for IT Service Management in all countries
and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) is an IT
governance framework and aiding toolset that permits managers to stretch the
gap between control prerequisites, technical matters and business risks. The
purpose of this paper is to recognize how COBIT can complement ITIL to attain
Business-IT Alignment."
"The advancement of e-learning technologies has made it viable for
developments in education and technology to be combined in order to fulfil
educational needs worldwide. E-learning consists of informal learning
approaches and emerging technologies to support the delivery of learning
skills, materials, collaboration and knowledge sharing. E-learning is a
holistic approach that covers a wide range of courses, technologies and
infrastructures to provide an effective learning environment. The Learning
Management System (LMS) is the core of the entire e-learning process along with
technology, content, and services. This paper investigates the role of
model-driven personalisation support modalities in providing enhanced levels of
learning and trusted assimilation in an e-learning delivery context. We present
an analysis of the impact of an integrated learning path that an e-learning
system may employ to track activities and evaluate the performance of learners."
"The realities of climate change are gradually dawning on everyone including
children. The need for a disaster reduction education requires the use of
mobile technologies to identify some of the impact of climate change within an
environment and create awareness on the dangers associated with climate change.
Since the pre service teachers will teach the primary school pupils, it is apt
that the use of mobile technologies should constitute part of their preparation
while in training. This paper examined pre service teachers perception of using
mobile technologies in teaching climate change in the primary school. One
hundred and fifty (150) pre service teachers in two Colleges of Education in
the erosion disaster zones of Anambra and Imo States in the south eastern state
of Nigeria were used for the study. Three research questions guided the study.
The study utilized a survey approach to collect and analyze the data. The
results from the study show that the pre-service teachers were confident that
the use of mobile devices will create significant climate change awareness.
However, the pre service teachers saw the need for using mobile devices fin
their preparation. Suggestions were made towards ensuring the integration of
mobile technology literacy in the pre service teacher education curriculum."
"We examine the process of engineering features for developing models that
improve our understanding of learners' online behavior in MOOCs. Because
feature engineering relies so heavily on human insight, we argue that extra
effort should be made to engage the crowd for feature proposals and even their
operationalization. We show two approaches where we have started to engage the
crowd. We also show how features can be evaluated for their relevance in
predictive accuracy. When we examined crowd-sourced features in the context of
predicting stopout, not only were they nuanced, but they also considered more
than one interaction mode between the learner and platform and how the learner
was relatively performing. We were able to identify different influential
features for stop out prediction that depended on whether a learner was in 1 of
4 cohorts defined by their level of engagement with the course discussion forum
or wiki. This report is part of a compendium which considers different aspects
of MOOC data science and stop out prediction."
"Studies have shown that the application of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)
increases the effectiveness of education. However, this is quite challenging to
be facilitated with learning technologies like Learning Management Systems
(LMS) that lack an individualised approach as well as a right balance between
the learner's freedom and guidance. Personalisation and adaptive technologies
have a high potential to support SRL in Personal Learning Environments (PLE),
which enable customisation and guidance of various strengths and at various
levels with SRL widgets. The main contribution of our paper is a framework that
integrates guidance and reflection support for SRL in PLEs. Therefore, we have
elaborated an operational SRL model. On that basis we have implemented a system
with a learner model, SRL widgets, monitoring and analytic tools, as well as
recommendation functionalities. We present concrete examples from both informal
and formal learning settings. Moreover, we present analytic results from our
SRL system - lab experiments and a public installation. With such a complex
setting we are coming close to the realisation of Responsive Open Learning
Environments (ROLE)."
"Several researches in psychology and science of education affirm the impact
of learning style on the learning process and encourage its taking into account
in the teaching strategies in order to facilitate the task for learners and
improve their results. This article deals with the relationship between the
characteristics of the learner, the teaching materials and the context in which
takes place the learning in order to allow a better adaptivity. The latter is
ensured thanks to the most important element of our system, which is the
generator of course, the latter allows you to offer a hypermedia virtual,
therefore the pages and the links will be built dynamically, taking into
account the learning style and the cognitive status of the learner. As well and
after having completed a first filter on the fragments, in order to select
those corresponding to the course, there will be applied a second filter to
select the fragments corresponding to the learning style of the learner to
retain only those in accordance with responsive to the level of knowledge
required."
"A significant portion of the radio frequency spectrum remains underutilized
due to exclusive and static allocation of spectrum. Provisioning secondary
access to the underutilized spectrum could be beneficial to the incumbents if
they could gain significant value out of the fallow spectrum while ensuring
protection of their primary services. From an incumbent perspective, the
spectrum sharing approach needs to be non-harmful as well as efficient. In
order to make spectrum sharing efficient, it is necessary to maximize the
spectrum available for secondary access as well as maximize its exploitation.
We examine the impact of the conservative assumptions that lead to lesser
availability of spectrum for secondary access. The problem of joint scheduling
and spectrum-access footprint allocation is at the heart of maximizing the
exploitation. This problem is NP-hard and we present a suboptimal approach
based on the minimal spectrum consumption cost of a spectrum-access request. In
order to improve the spectrum sharing potential, we investigate the impact of
the various design choices for a spectrum access mechanism. The experiments
demonstrate the significance of the active role of the incumbents, the benefits
of fine granular spectrum access, and the need for transceiver standards for
accomplishing efficient usage of the spectrum."
"The purpose of this study is to reflect on some questions concerning the
evaluation in information literacy. It is discussed some elements such as
scenarios, objects and methods in the evaluation of information literacy
programs. It is highlighted the need to influence in the context of such
programs as the result of student learning. Some notions emerged from the
educational field are taken into account to solidify the ideas presented here.
It is argued the implications of this type of assessment practices for
information professionals, who serve as trainers of information skills."
"Our proposal for selective subjects especially those involving intensive
problem-solving assignments and/or tutorials, such as Introduction to
Algorithms and Data structures, Discrete Mathematics, Coding Theory, Number
theory, Combinatorics and Graph Theory (CGT), Automata theory, is to supplement
lectures with a moderated online forum against an intranet portal. By way of
illustration we take the example of a restricted view of OEIS
(http://oeis.org). The restriction can be w.r.t. sequences in OEIS that are
directly relevant to say CGT. N.J.A.Sloane's OEIS is a collection of over
2,39,147 integer sequences and their properties. In particular OEIS contains
definitions of many combinatorial structures, dense range of interpretations,
generating functions and conjectured ones, cross references within OEIS and to
outside resources, references to texts and technical articles, codes in Maple,
Mathematica etc. For organizing courses such as the above mentioned, a first
task is to partially create an OEIS-like instructor-moderated portal in a
university intranet. During the course of lectures and tutorials students are
invited to contribute to the portal and these may be augmented/approved by
instructors suitably, to find a place in the portal. By this many concepts can
be conveyed to the students in an interesting way with the desired results. In
the arguments presented, examples related to CGT are given."
"Model of active and collaborative learning applied in training specific
subject makes clear advantage due to the goals of knowledge, skills that
students got to develop successful future job. The author exploits the learning
management system of Hanoi National University of Education to establish a
learning environment in the Introductory Physics course Part 2, which supports
to the blended learning, for the 1st year student. The method of pattern
languages is taken to redesign learning content in the framework of ACLM, which
focused on analysing real-life application and doing exercises, with the
support of information and communication technology. Both formative and
summative assessments were used to evaluate competency of students."
"The problem of improving the efficiency of the teaching department through
the development of teaching department work area is described. Development of
an automated workplace of a teaching department who allows to realize
monitoring of progress of students, monitoring of mastering of disciplines by
students, is synchronized with an automated workplace of the teacher of the
higher school and autocompletes the report of movement of the contingent.
Besides, the designed system allows to increase efficiency and efficiency of
activities of employees of a teaching department."
"Having observed low success rates among first-year university students in
both Belgium and France, we develop prediction models in this paper in order to
identify, at the earliest possible stage, those students who are at risk of
failing at the end of the academic year. We applied different data mining
techniques to predict the students' academic success. We find that it is very
difficult to predict success by only considering the variables related to
behavior during classes, and that it is necessary to add variables related to
personal history, involvement in and behavior during their studies, and
perceptions of academic life, to obtain good-quality results."
"Electronic (E) learning management system is not a novel idea in the
educational domain. Learning management systems are used to deal with academic
activities such as course syllabi, time table scheduling, assessments and
project discussion forums. Almost, all the top universities of world are using
general purpose/customized solutions to manage learning management systems like
SAP, Oracle, Moodle and Blackboard. The aim of this paper i.e., Mobile (M)
Learning System (MLS) is not to substitute the traditional web based E learning
applications but to enhance it by amalgamating both web and mobile
technologies. This idea justifies the proposal of M learning system to use some
of the services of E learning system from mobiles. MLS will use
state-of-the-art IP Multimedia Sub System technology. The emphasis in this
research will be on the technical implementation of the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) using IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) to develop an MLS not only
for the students of the King Abdulaziz University but it will be beneficial for
the students of other universities at Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A customized CBD
is proposed as per the nature of MLS project. MLS case study is used as a
research design to validate the customized CBD model. Multi-tier applications
architecture (client, web, and business) will be adopted during the development
of MLS case study. An MLS will be developed and tested using IMS platform to
check its practicality for the students of King Abdulaziz University. It is
anticipated that the proposed system will significantly facilitate to both the
students and teachers of KAU during their off campus activities."
"In this paper we consider two social organizations -- service-oriented
communities and fractal organizations -- and discuss how their main
characteristics provide an answer to several shortcomings of traditional
organizations. In particular, we highlight their ability to tap into the vast
basins of ""social energy"" of our societies. This is done through the
establishing of mutualistic relationships among the organizational components.
The paper also introduces a mathematical model of said mutualistic processes as
well as its translation in terms of semantic service description and matching.
Preliminary investigations of the resilience of fractal social organizations
are reported. Simulations show that fractal organizations outperform
non-fractal organizations and are able to quickly recover from disruptions and
changes characterizing dynamic environments."
"By increase of culture and knowledge of the people, request for visiting
museums has increased and made the management of these places more complex.
Valuable things in a museum or ancient place must be maintained well and also
it need to managing visitors. To maintain things we should prevent them from
theft, as well as environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, PH,
chemical factors and mechanical events should be monitored. And if the
conditions are damaging, appropriate alerts or reports to managers and experts
should be announced. Visitors should also be monitored, as well as visitors
need to be guided and getting information in the environment. By utilizing RFID
technology and short-distance network tools, technical solutions for more
efficient management and more effective retention in museums can be
implemented."
"Quality of service in cellular communication system is a topic that recently
has raised much interest for many researchers. This paper presents the findings
obtained from the study on factors affecting QoS in Tanzania cellular networks.
The study was carried out in Dodoma Municipal, Tanzania. The study employed
cross sectional research design. Information was gathered from structured
questionnaire of 240 subscribers during the study of quality of service for the
four leading cellular networks in Tanzania. Both qualitative and quantitative
data from field survey were collected and analyzed using Statistical Package
for Social Sciences and Excel software. The study findings show that the major
factors that degrade QoS in Tanzania cellular networks are inadequate network
infrastructure, lack of fairness from service providers and little efforts
taken by the government in enforcing the national agreed standards. Other
factors are lack of reliable end to end systems, geographical terrain, low
quality handsets, poor government monitoring on standards and lack of
subscriber skills and training."
"The lack of data regarding Information and Communications Technology sector
alumni data is a known problem in several countries including Egypt. It is not
clear what entry and senior jobs are occupied by alumni and which countries
attract them. This affects the planning, design and execution of both the ICT
sector and the Education sector. In this research, a joint team is formulated
from the Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center TIEC and the
Ministry of Higher Education. This team is undertaking extensive analysis of
the structure, distribution and development of the ICT skills and employment."
"This study aimed at identifying the issue, challenges and opportunities from
the health consumers in Tanzania towards interoperability of electronic health
records. Recognizing that we conducted a study to identify the challenges,
issues and opportunities towards health information exchange. The study was
conducted in three major cities of Tanzania. This was in order to come up with
a clear picture of how to implement some EHRs that will be trusted by health
consumers. The participants (n=240) were surveyed on computer usage, EHRs
knowledge, demographics, security and privacy issues. A total of 200 surveys
were completed and returned (83.3% response rate). 67.5% were women, 62.6% had
not heard of EHRs, 73% highly concerned about privacy and security of their
information. 75% believed that introduction of various security mechanisms will
make EHRs more secure. A number of chi-square tests (p<0.05) showed there was a
strong relationship among the variable of age, computer use, EHRs knowledge and
concerns for privacy and security. The study showed that there was a small
difference of 8.5% between those who think EHRs are safer than paper records
and those who think otherwise. The general observation of the study was that in
order to make EHRs successful, then the issue of security, and health consumer
involvement were two key towards the road of successful EHRs in our hospitals
practices and that will make consumers more willing to allow their records to
be shared."
"Interest has been revived in the creation of a ""bill of rights"" for Internet
users. This paper analyzes users' rights into ten broad principles, as a basis
for assessing what users regard as important and for comparing different
multi-issue Internet policy proposals. Stability of the principles is
demonstrated in an experimental survey, which also shows that freedoms of users
to participate in the design and coding of platforms appear to be viewed as
inessential relative to other rights. An analysis of users' rights frameworks
that have emerged over the past twenty years similarly shows that such
proposals tend to leave out freedoms related to software platforms, as opposed
to user data or public networks. Evaluating policy frameworks in a comparative
analysis based on prior principles may help people to see what is missing and
what is important as the future of the Internet continues to be debated."
"S.A.T.E.P. means Synchronous Asynchronous Tele education Platform is a
software application for educational purposes, with a lot of parametrizing
features written entirely from scratch. It aims at the training and examination
of computer skills, a platform that can be adjusted to the needs of each
lesson. In the application the trainer and the administrator can define the
number of the lectures and upload files for each one of them. Furthermore, he
can insert, modify and delete questions which are used for evaluation tests but
also for the trainees examinations. The trainee can read and download the files
of each lesson and also test his knowledge on what he has studied through a
series of questions. A chat module where registered users as well as system
administrator can discuss and solve questions is also developed."
"The purpose of this study is to establish whether the use of information
technology (IT) by elected municipal representatives, for constituency work,
emboldens the adoption of e-service in municipals of a developing country. The
research data was obtained through the completion of a questionnaire by a
sample of respondents who serve as authorities of IT in South African
municipals. The findings from both descriptive and inferential data analysis of
collected data confirm that the use of IT by elected municipal representatives
for constituency work impacts the adoption of e-service in municipals.
Furthermore, the use of IT by elected municipal representatives for
constituency work correlated with both e-service laws and e-service security.
This study contributes to a better understanding of choices needed when
planning for the adoption of e-service initiatives in municipals of developing
countries. Given that 87.2% of respondents are aware of a high access to
telephone mobile, a further research is needed to clarify why most elected
municipal representatives of a developing country choose not to exploit IT for
their constituency work, and similarly why municipals of a developing country
do not exploit IT to provide services."
"Given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence,
web-based education systems have became complementary and, in some cases,
viable alternatives to traditional classroom teaching. The popularity of these
systems stems from their ability to make education available to a large
demographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of
the personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:
they continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first
systematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.
Personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided
personalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes
already taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific
context, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching
materials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be
adapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,
likes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor,
is able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching
methodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a
student) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the
time spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We
illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor
platform which is used for remedial training for a Digital Signal Processing
(DSP) course."
"The article analyzes the humanistic basis of expo-design in conjunction with
the ideological problems of modern design and the causes of their occurrence.
It reveals the potential of mobile exhibition for social transformation in
terms of its structural and ideological aesthetic content. It substantiates the
effectiveness of expo-design expression's artistic and aesthetic means in
viewer personality moral education. It investigates the features of social

components features of mobile exhibition."
"Several ICT studies give anecdotal evidences showing privacy to be an area of
concern that can influence adoption of technology in the developing world.
However, in-depth understanding of end users' privacy attitudes and awareness
is largely unexplored in developing countries such as India. We conducted a
survey with 10,427 Indian citizens to bring forth various insights on privacy
expectations and perceptions of end users. Our study explores end-users'
privacy expectations on three ICT platforms - mobile phones, OSN (Online Social
Network), and government projects. Our results, though preliminary, show that
users disproportionately consider financial details as personal information in
comparison to medical records. Users heavily use mobile phones to store
personal details and show high trust in mobile service providers for protecting
the private data. However, users show concerns that mobile service provider may
allow improper access of their personal information to third parties and
government. We also find that female participants in the study were marginally
more conscious of their privacy than males. To the best of our knowledge, this
work presents the largest privacy study which benchmarks privacy perceptions
among Indian citizens. Understanding users' privacy perceptions can help
improve technology adoption and develop policies and laws for improving
technology experience and enabling development for a better life in India."
"In this paper, we have proposed a new smartphone based system for health
care, monitoring and diagnosis, which is specially designed to efficiently
increase the public health care system in the distant, rural, unreached areas
of the underdeveloped and developing countries. In this all-in-one system, we
have digitized the health monitoring and diagnostic devices in a way so that
each device works as a minimum `plug and play' sensor module of the total
system, reducing the cost radically. Besides, the easy-to-use smartphone
application for operating the whole system reduces the necessity of skilled and
trained manpower, making it a perfect toolbox for the government health workers
in the unreached rural areas."
"The usage of mobile devices for mobile learning is becoming increasingly
popular. There is a new brand of students in the universities now-a-days who
are easily connected to technology and innovative mobile devices. We attempt to
do an analysis on a survey done with university students on mobile device usage
for mobile learning purposes. This is to find the learning trends within the
student community so that some of these popular practices could be encouraged
to enhance learning among the student community. Both the quantitative and
qualitative approaches are adopted in the analysis. The results are discussed
and conclusions drawn in the end."
"Mobile learning through wireless enabled laptops (say, within a university
campus) can make use of the learning management system that is already
available through internet or intranet. Without restrictions within the four
walls of computer labs or library, students can now access the learning
resources anywhere in the campus where wireless access points or hotspots are
located. We briefly investigate on the mobile learning benefits and eventually
an analysis of the student perceptions on mobile learning is presented through
a survey, to validate the m-learning benefits."
"Innovation in assessment is no more a choice in a tech-savvy instant age. The
purpose of this study was to get more insight into the implementation of
formative assessment through the e-learning tool called Black Board Learning
System in our University. The proposal is to implement a series of weekly or
fortnightly tests on the BB. These would have options to provide sufficient
feedback as a follow up to the attempt of students. Responses from
questionnaires were used to discover the important concerns in the perceptions
of students on the proposed concept of continuous assessment and the BB Online
test implementation. The results indicate that students support the idea mainly
because they find the disintegration into small topic assessments as useful,
coupled with the availability of immediate teacher feedback. What we intend is
a culture of success, backed by a belief that all pupils can achieve the same."
"In an era where learning is considered a problem, we decided to go for
problems for the sake of learning! The purpose of this study was to throw light
on the issues involved in two forms of PBL viz., Case Study Based PBL and
Research Based PBL The influence of course and subject on the learning method
was investigated. Students perceptions and concerns were analyzed using
questionnaires. A slight variation was found among the different courses of
Engineering, Business and IT, as also among the sample subjects considered. It
is concluded that careful and systematic introduction to the case study based
learning can be progressively led to the Research based learning as the student
progresses from the first semester to the final semester of a graduate degree
course or from graduate degree course to post graduate degree course."
"The use of modern technology in Education is the key to an increased drive
for learning which shape learners critical and analytic competencies with
respect to disciplinary knowledge. Distance education (DE) is a system of
learning driven by computer linked to internet. The flexible nature of DE avail
students who are unable to attend full time education due to age, social or
religious barriers. However, in Nigeria, the University of Lagos distance
learning Institute has its shortfalls traced to poor student support system,
which affects the service delivery to students. The study examined Influence of
Information Support on ICT use by distance learners."
"In this paper, we discuss a new contact way for exchanging personal
information using mobile phones. The idea of this invention depends on
allocating a special code called Gharibi Code (GC) for each personal mobile and
creating a personal information file called Gharibi Face Card (GFC), which has
all specified personal data of the mobile phone user. When you request
someone's GC code, the other party's phone will send you the GFC of that
person. We think that this approach will facilitate the process of
communication and exchanging the specified personal data easily, especially
when acquaintance. Mobile number, phone and e-mail address, for example, will
be sent in a few seconds using a simple code that does not exceed six
characters long to transfer a huge amount of personal data through mobile
devices rather than using traditional business or visiting cards."
"With the advent of Web 2.0, an increasing number of web sites has started
offering their data over the web in standard formats and exposed their
functionality as APIs. A new type of applications has taken advantage of the
new data and services available by mixing them, in order to generate new
applications fast and efficiently, getting its name from its own architectural
style: mashups. A set of applications that aims to help a user create, deploy
and manage his mashups has also emerged, using various approaches. In this
paper we discuss the key factors that should be taken into consideration when
designing a mashup creator, along with the most important challenges that offer
a field for research."
"For the past decade, 3D printing (3DP) has become popular due to availability
of low-cost 3D printers such as RepRap and Fab@Home; and better software, which
offers a broad range of manufacturing platform that enables users to create
customizable products. 3DP offers everybody with the power to convert a digital
design into a three dimensional physical object. While the application of 3DP
in developing countries is still at an early stage, the technology application
promises vast solutions to existing problems. This paper presents a critical
review of the current state of art of 3DP with a particular focus on developing
countries. Moreover, it discusses the challenges, opportunities and future
insights of 3DP in developing countries. This paper will serve as a basis for
discussion and further research on this area."
"This paper introduces the Solar Lab Notebook (SLN), an electronic lab
notebook for improving the process of recording and sharing solar related
digital information in an organized manner. SLN is a pure web-based application
(available online: http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/sln) that runs client-side
only, employing a clean and very friendly graphical user interface design, and
thus providing a true cross-platform user experience. Furthermore, SLN
leverages unique technologies offered by modern web browsers, such as the
FileReader API, the Blob interface and Local Storage mechanism; it is coded
entirely using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and powered by the extremely well
documented XML file format. For high-security labs, it can be utilized as an
ultra-portable and secure digital notebook solution, since it is functionally
self-contained, and does not require any server-side process running on either
the local or a remote system. Finally, the W3C XML Schema language is used to
define a list of rules, namely a data standard, that an SLN file must conform
to in order to be valid. In this way, developers are able to implement their
own validation functions in their projects, or use one of the freely available
tools to check if a data file is properly structured. Similarly, scientific
groups at different labs can easily share information, being confident about
the integrity of the exchanged data."
"A vast amount of OpenCourseWare (OCW) is meanwhile being published online to
make educational content accessible to larger audiences. The awareness of such
courses among users and the popularity of systems providing such courses are
increasing. However, from a subjective experience, OCW is frequently cursory,
outdated or non-reusable. In order to obtain a better understanding of the
quality of OCW, we assess the quality in terms of fitness for use. Based on
three OCW use case scenarios, we define a range of dimensions according to
which the quality of courses can be measured. From the definition of each
dimension a comprehensive list of quality metrics is derived. In order to
obtain a representative overview of the quality of OCW, we performed a quality
assessment on a set of 100 randomly selected courses obtained from 20 different
OCW repositories. Based on this assessment we identify crucial areas in which
OCW needs to improve in order to deliver up to its promises."
"What would a human hundreds or thousands times more intelligent than the
brightest human ever born be like? We must admit we can hardly guess. A human
being of such intelligence will be so radically different from us that it can
hardly, if at all, be recognized as human. If we had to go back along the
evolutionary tree to identify a creature 1000 times less intelligent than the
average contemporary human, we will have to go really far back. Would it be a
kind of a lizard? An insect perhaps? Considering this, how can we possibly
aspire to have a grasp of something a thousand times more intelligent than us?
When it comes to intelligence, even the very attempt to quantify it is highly
misleading. Now if we attend to a seemingly adjacent question, what would a
machine with such capacity for intelligence be like? Just coming up with an
approximate metaphor requires a huge stretch of the imagination, meaning that
almost anything goes... What would a society of such super intelligent agents,
be they human, machines or an amalgam of both, be like? Well, here we are
transported into the realm of pure speculation. Technological Singularity is
referred to as the event of artificial intelligence surpassing the intelligence
of humans and shortly after augmenting itself far beyond that. It is no wonder
that the mathematical concept of singularity has become the symbol of an event
so disruptive and so far reaching that it is impossible to conceptually or even
metaphorically grasp, much less to predict."
"The modern engineering landscape increasingly requires a range of skills to
successfully integrate complex systems. Project-based learning is used to help
students build professional skills. However, it is typically applied to small
teams and small efforts. This paper describes an experience in engaging a large
number of students in research projects within a multi-year interdisciplinary
research effort. The projects expose the students to various disciplines in
Computer Science (embedded systems, algorithm design, networking), Electrical
Engineering (circuit design, wireless communications, hardware prototyping),
and Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication). While a
student project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires
interaction with at least two other areas. Over 5 years, 180 semester-long
projects have been completed. The students were a diverse group of high school,
undergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical
Engineering students. Some of the approaches that were taken to facilitate
student learning are real-world system development constraints, regular
cross-group meetings, and extensive involvement of Ph.D. students in student
mentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess the approaches, a survey was
conducted among the participating students. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approaches. For example, 70% of the students surveyed
indicated that working on their research project improved their ability to
function on multidisciplinary teams more than coursework, internships, or any
other activity."
"Data will soon become one of the most precious treasures we have ever had, 43
trillion gigabytes of data will be created by 2020 according to a study made by
Mckinsey Global Institute, it is estimated that 2.3 trillion gigabytes of data
is created each day and most companies in the US have 100.000 gigabytes of data
stored. Data is recorded, stored and analyzed to enable technology and services
that the world relies on every day, this technology is getting smarter and we
will be soon living in a world of smart services or what is called smart
cities. This article presents an overview of the topic pointing to its actual
status and forecasting the crucial roles it will play in the future, we will
define big data analytics and smart cities and talk about their potential
contributions in changing our way of living and finally we will discuss the
possible down side of this upcoming technologies and how it can fool us,
violate our privacy and turn us into puppets or technology slaves."
"The Internet has become the new battle ground between authoritarian regimes
and ordinary individuals who want unimpeded access to information. The immense
popularity of online activism and citizen journalism enabled by social media
has instigated state level players to partially or completely block access to
the Internet. In return, individuals and organizations have been employing
various anti-censorship tools to circumvent these restrictions. In this paper,
we claim that censorship is futile as not only has it been ineffective in
restricting access, it has also had the side-effect of popularising blocked
content. Using data from Alexa Web Rankings, Google Trends, and YouTube
Statistics, we quantify the ineffectiveness of state level censorship in
Pakistan and Turkey and highlight the emergence of the Streisand Effect. We
hope that our findings will, a) prove to governments and other players the
futility of their actions, and b) aid citizens around the world in using legal
measures to counteract censorship by showing its ineffectiveness."
"Now-a-days Health Care industry is well equipped with Medical Equipments to
provide accurate and timely reports of investigation and examination results.
Medical Equipments available in market are made for specific tests suited for a
particular laboratory leading to a wide variety of devices. The result viewing
experience on console of these devices is not only cumborsome for medical staff
but inefficient. Therefore, Medical Equipment Interfaces act as backbone of any
Hospital Management Information System assisting in better management and
delivery of test results. It also acts as a mode to collect data for further
research and analysis. These equipments communicate via a fixed data format but
compatibility among these formats is a major issue being faced in modern and
legacy medical equipments. In this paper, we present a case study of designing
and implementing a cloud based Generic Medical Equipment Interface(GMEI) along
with the state of the art in such systems. This solution removes the burden of
reentry of patient details into the Electronic Health Record(EHR) and thrives
for accelerating EMR initiative in the country"
"Pervasive healthcare is an emerging technology that aims to provide
round-the-clock monitoring of several vital signs of patients using various
health sensors, specialized communication protocols, and intelligent
context-aware applications. Pervasive healthcare applications proactively
contact the caregiver provided any abnormality arises in the health condition
of a monitored patient. It has been a boon to the patients suffering from
different diseases and requiring continuous monitoring and care, such as,
disabled individuals, elderly and weak persons living alone, children of
different ages, and adults who are susceptible to near-fatal falls or sudden
increases in blood pressure, heart rates, stress level, etc. Existing surveys
on pervasive healthcare cover generic techniques or a particular application,
like fall detection. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive coverage of
several common disorders addressed by pervasive healthcare in recent years. We
roughly classify different diseases by age groups of patients and then discuss
various hardware and software tools and techniques to detect or treat them. We
have also included detailed tabular classification of a large selection of
significant research articles in pervasive healthcare."
"The Government of India is transcending from traditional modus operandi of
governance towards technological involvement in the process of governance.
Currently, the Government of India is in the transition phase and seamlessly
unleashing the power of ICT in governance. The government is spending an
enormous amount of finances in deployment of e-governance, but, are these
efforts are going in the appropriate direction and leads towards intended
results? What do the people percept from the concept of e-governance? What is
the global perspective about perception of e-governance? What are the major
challenges confronting the deployment of e-governance? In this attempt the
authors have made an attempt to riposte aforesaid issues. Moreover, the authors
have also suggested some plausible suggestions which may help in successful and
sustainable deployment of e-governance in India."
"Educational Data Mining is a growing trend in case of higher education. The
quality of the Educational Institute may be enhanced through discovering hidden
knowledge from the student databases/ data warehouses. Present paper is
designed to carry out a comparative study with the TDC (Three Year Degree)
Course students of different colleges affiliated to Dibrugarh University. The
study is conducted with major subject wise, gender wise and category/caste

Plot, Fit Y by X, Run Chart, Control Chart etc. of the SAS JMP Software."
"In todays fast pacing, highly competing,volatile and challenging world,
companies highly rely on data analysis obtained from both offline as well as
online way to make their future strategy, to sustain in the market. This paper
reviews the regression technique analysis on a real time web data to analyse
different attributes of interest and to predict possible growth factors for the
company, so as to enable the company to make possible strategic decisions for
the growth of the company."
"This study is about harvesting point of interest from GPS trajectories.
Trajectories are the paths that moving objects move by follow through space in
a function of time while GPS trajectories generally are point-sequences with
geographic coordinates, time stamp, speed and heading. User can get information
from GPS enable device. For example, user can acquire present location, search
the information around them and design driving routes to a destination and thus
design travel itineraries. By sharing GPS logs among each other, people are
able to find some places that attract them from other people's travel route.
Analysis on the GPS logs can get the point of interest that is popular. By
present the point of interest, user can choose travel place easily and the
travel itineraries is plan based on the user preferences."
"This article discusses the difficulties that arose when attempting to specify
and design a large scale digital learning environment for Scottish schools.
This had a potential user base of about 1 million users and was intended to
replace an existing, under-used system. We found that the potential system
users were not interested in engaging with the project and that there were
immense problems with system governance. The only technique that we found to be
useful were user stories, presenting scenarios of how the system might be used
by students and their teachers. The designed architecture was based around a
layered set of replaceable services."
"Mobile technologies are growing significantly in past few years. Many new
features and enhancement have implemented in mobile technologies in both
software and hardware aspects. Nowadays, cell phones are not just only use for
making calls or sending text messages, however, technologies behind mobile
phones expanded vastly which facilitate them to offer various types of
services. Location-based service is one of the most popular mobile technologies
which equipped in new generation of hand phones. The main focus of this paper
is to review various strategic location-based applications on mobile networks
and devices."
"The online learning tools and management also known as Learning Management
System (LMS) have been adopted by higher education as it allows convenient and
flexibility in learning process between students and instructors or tutors with
minimal cost. The adoption of online learning tools in university has allowed
users (students and instructors) to interact, share and discuss
anytime-anywhere conveniently. Many students nowadays rely on online resources
based using their mobile devices, substituting traditional learning
interactions. Universities need strategy to sustain in providing intensive
interactions and spreading word out mouth of good services through online
learning tools by focusing on niche markets and creating close relationship
with their stakeholders. The study presented in this paper analyses how
universities design best practices in adopting LMS and evaluate its current
state for future improvement. In fact, with proper strategies of LMS,
universities have opportunities to sustain their business by offering
interesting packages and to improve their services through intensive
interactions with their users. In this study, we deploy Transaction Cost
Economics (TCE) to understand the change business environment and to construct
a model for higher institution to regulate their scenario on online learning
strategies in fast changing and threatening business environment."
"This paper aims to present an online placement test. It is based on the Item
Response Theory to provide relevant estimates of learner competences. The
proposed test is the entry point of our e-Learning system. It gathers the
learner response to a set of questions and uses a specific developed algorithm
to estimate its level. This algorithm identifies learning gaps, which allows
tutors to conceive sequence of courses and remediation adapted to each case of
learner, in order to achieve a competence."
"Online Behavioural targeted Advertising (OBA) has risen in prominence as a
method to increase the effectiveness of online advertising. OBA operates by
associating tags or labels to users based on their online activity and then
using these labels to target them. This rise has been accompanied by privacy
concerns from researchers, regulators and the press. In this paper, we present
a novel methodology for measuring and understanding OBA in the online
advertising market. We rely on training artificial online personas representing
behavioural traits like 'cooking', 'movies', 'motor sports', etc. and build a
measurement system that is automated, scalable and supports testing of multiple
configurations. We observe that OBA is a frequent practice and notice that
categories valued more by advertisers are more intensely targeted. In addition,
we provide evidences showing that the advertising market targets sensitive
topics (e.g, religion or health) despite the existence of regulation that bans
such practices. We also compare the volume of OBA advertising for our personas
in two different geographical locations (US and Spain) and see little
geographic bias in terms of intensity of OBA targeting. Finally, we check for
targeting with do-not-track (DNT) enabled and discovered that DNT is not yet
enforced in the web."
"Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every year.
Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,
such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The
analysis of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from
the mobile phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize
human behavior during critical events. In this work, we investigate the
viability of using CDR data combined with other sources of information to
characterize the floods that occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map
has been reconstructed using Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within
this frame, the underlying communication activity signals in the CDR data have
been analyzed and compared against rainfall levels extracted from data of the
NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number of active phones connected to
each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns in the most affected
locations during and after the floods that could be used as signatures of the
floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment and population
information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has been assessed
using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using
cell tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency
management mechanisms."
"Although computer scientists are generally familiar with the achievements of
computer vision technology in art history, these accomplishments are little
known and often misunderstood by scholars in the humanities. To clarify the
parameters of this seeming disjuncture, we have addressed the concerns that one
example of the digitization of the humanities poses on social, philosophical,
and practical levels. In support of our assessment of the perceptions held by
computer scientists and art historians about the use of computer vision
technology to examine art, we based our interpretations on two surveys that
were distributed in August 2014. In this paper, the development of these
surveys and their results are discussed in the context of the major
philosophical conclusions of our research in this area to date."
"The Information Systems around patents are complex, their study coupled with
a creative vision of ""out of the box"", overcomes the strict basic functions of
the patent. We have, on several occasions, guiding research around the patent
solely-based on information, since the writing of new patents ; invalidation of
existing patents, the creation of value-added information and their links to
other Information Systems. The traditional R&D based on heavy investments is
one type of technology transfer. But, patent information is also, another
powerful tool of technology transfer, innovation and creativity. Indeed,
conduct research on the patent, from an academic viewpoint, although not always
focusing only on financial revenue, can be considered as a form of ""Non
Practicing Entities"" (NPE) activity, called rightly or wrongly ""Patent Trolls"".
We'll see why the term ""patent troll"" for this activity is controversial and
inappropriate. The research we will describe in this paper falls within this
context. We show two case studies of efficient use of patent information in
Emerging countries, the first concern the pharmaceutical industry in Brazil and
the second, the oil industry in Algeria."
"An undergraduate compilers course poses significant challenges to students,
in both the conceptual richness of the major components and in the programming
effort necessary to implement them. In this paper, I argue that a related
architecture, the interpreter, serves as an effective conceptual framework in
which to teach some of the later stages of the compiler pipeline. This
framework can serve both to unify some of the major concepts that are taught in
a typical undergraduate course and to structure the implementation of a
semester-long compiler project."
"""Big Data is the oil of the new economy"" is the most famous citation during
the three last years. It has even been adopted by the World Economic Forum in
2011. In fact, Big Data is like crude! It's valuable, but if unrefined it
cannot be used. It must be broken down, analyzed for it to have value. But what
about Big Data generated by the Petroleum Industry and particularly its
upstream segment?
  Upstream is no stranger to Big Data. Understanding and leveraging data in the
upstream segment enables firms to remain competitive throughout planning,
exploration, delineation, and field development. Oil & Gas Companies conduct
advanced geophysics modeling and simulation to support operations where 2D, 3D
& 4D Seismic generate significant data during exploration phases. They closely
monitor the performance of their operational assets. To do this, they use
thousands sensors in subsurface wells and surface facilities to provide
continuous and real-time monitoring of assets and environmental conditions.
Unfortunately, this information comes in various and increasingly complex
forms, making it a challenge to collect, interpret, and leverage the disparate
data.
  Big Data technologies integrate common and disparate data sets to deliver the
right information at the appropriate time to the correct decision-maker. These
capabilities help firms act on large volumes of data, transforming
decision-making from reactive to proactive and optimizing all phases of
exploration, development and production. Furthermore, Big Data offers multiple
opportunities to ensure safer, more responsible operations. Another invaluable
effect of that would be shared learning.
  The aim of this paper is to explain how to use Big Data technologies to
optimize operations. How can Big Data help experts to decision-making leading
the desired outcomes?"
"The paper analyzes the socio-economic impacts of dropshipping - a new form of
organization of sales, is rapidly gaining the Russian market. Dropshipping
opens up tremendous prospects not only for ordinary people, but also for the
Russian manufacturers, which if used properly can dropshipping opportunities
with minimal direct access to the world market."
"People treat smartphones as a second skin, having them around nearly 24/7 and
constantly interacting with them. Although smartphones are used mainly for
personal communication, social networking and web browsing, they have many
connectivity capabilities, and are at the same time equipped with a wide range
of embedded sensors. Additionally, bluetooth connectivity can be leveraged to
collect data from external sensors, greatly extending the sensing capabilities.
However, massive data-gathering using smartphones still poses many
architectural challenges, such as limited battery and processing power, and
possibly connectivity costs.
  This article describes SenseMyCity (SMC), an Internet of Things mobile urban
sensor that is extensible and fully configurable. The platform consists of an
app, a backoffice and a frontoffice. The SMC app can collect data from embedded
sensors, like GPS, wifi, accelerometer, magnetometer, etc, as well as from
external bluetooth sensors, ranging from On-Board Diagnostics gathering data
from vehicles, to wearable cardiac sensors. Adding support for new internal or
external sensors is straightforward due to the modular architecture. Data
transmission to our servers can occur either on-demand or in real-time, while
keeping costs down by only using the configured type of Internet connectivity.
We discuss our experience implementing the platform and using it to make
longitudinal studies with many users. Further, we present results on bandwidth
utilization and energy consumption for different sensors and sampling rates.
Finally, we show two use cases: mapping fuel consumption and user stress
extracted from cardiac sensors."
"Daring predictions of the proximate future can establish shared discursive
frameworks, mobilize capital, and steer complex processes. Among the prophetic
visions that encouraged and accompanied the development of new communication
technologies was the ""Digital Earth,"" described in a 1998 speech by Al Gore as
a high-resolution representation of the planet to share and analyze detailed
information about its state. This article traces a genealogy of the Digital
Earth as a techno-scientific myth, locating it in a constellation of media
futures, arguing that a common subtext of these envisionments consists of a
dream of wholeness, an afflatus to overcome perceived fragmentation among
humans, and between humans and the Earth."
"Location and mobility patterns of individuals are important to environmental
planning, societal resilience, public health, and a host of commercial
applications. Mining telecommunication traffic and transactions data for such
purposes is controversial, in particular raising issues of privacy. However,
our hypothesis is that privacy-sensitive uses are possible and often beneficial
enough to warrant considerable research and development efforts. Our work
contends that peoples behavior can yield patterns of both significant
commercial, and research, value. For such purposes, methods and algorithms for
mining telecommunication data to extract commonly used routes and locations,
articulated through time-geographical constructs, are described in a case study
within the area of transportation planning and analysis. From the outset, these
were designed to balance the privacy of subscribers and the added value of
mobility patterns derived from their mobile communication traffic and
transactions data. Our work directly contrasts the current, commonly held
notion that value can only be added to services by directly monitoring the
behavior of individuals, such as in current attempts at location-based
services. We position our work within relevant legal frameworks for privacy and
data protection, and show that our methods comply with such requirements and
also follow best-practices"
"Cloud computing in eHealth is an emerging area for only few years. There
needs to identify the state of the art and pinpoint challenges and possible
directions for researchers and applications developers. Based on this need, we
have conducted a systematic review of cloud computing in eHealth. We searched
ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Inspec, ISI Web of Science and Springer as
well as relevant open-access journals for relevant articles. A total of 237
studies were first searched, of which 44 papers met the Include Criteria. The
studies identified three types of studied areas about cloud computing in
eHealth, namely (1) cloud-based eHealth framework design (n=13); (2)
applications of cloud computing (n=17); and (3) security or privacy control
mechanisms of healthcare data in the cloud (n=14). Most of the studies in the
review were about designs and concept-proof. Only very few studies have
evaluated their research in the real world, which may indicate that the
application of cloud computing in eHealth is still very immature. However, our
presented review could pinpoint that a hybrid cloud platform with mixed access
control and security protection mechanisms will be a main research area for
developing citizen centred home-based healthcare applications."
"Today's lectures are often talks following a straight line of slides. In many
lectures the process of content teaching is not as efficient as it could be.
Technologies, such as smart-phones and wireless communication, enable a new
level of interaction between lecturer, content and audience. We describe how
current lecture material can be semantically enhanced, to interactively assist
the audience during and after a lecture."
"In open collaborative projects like Wikipedia, interactions among users can
produce tension and misunderstandings. Complex disputes require more
sophisticated mechanisms of conflict resolution. In this paper, we examine the
case of the Spanish Wikipedia and its Arbitration Committee, known as CRC, over
its two years of activity. We postulate that the high percentage of rejections
of cases presented by non-administrators, the lack of diversity inside the
committee (composed only by administrators), and the high number of cases
involving administrators played a central role in its eventual downfall. We
conclude that mechanisms that fail to acknowledge the ecosystem they are part
of cannot succceed. Therefore, further research is needed to determine if
granting more decision-making power to non-administrators may lead to more
effective conflict resolution mechanisms."
"The controllability of a factory is highly dependent on the capability of a
given enterprise planning system to interact with the shop floor, and the
capability of any authorized user to review the operation plans, as well as the
status of any sales order on the shop floor. We have called the concept
E-manufacturing, which is a concept to improve the controllability of a factory
by connecting the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to the shop floor
control (SFC) system through the Internet. Business systems and plant systems
must be coupled to reduce decision cycle times and increase plant productivity,
as well as eliminating human intervention to improve accuracy and data
availability speed. This paper is the output of a project funded by the
Egyptian Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology, through the Electronic
Research Institute. The overall objective of the ministerial program is
bridging the gap between R&D and manufacturing to fulfill the immediate
technological needs of the Egyptian industry and economy, and building a
national technology know-how expertise. This is achieved, in this project, by
addressing the development of an E-Manufacturing system using available RFID
state-of-the-art technology. The specific objective is developing an end
product for Egyptian industry that manages real-time interaction with back end
ERP systems to correct delays on the shop floor, improving real-time operation,
reducing cost, and allow real-time visibility, through the intelligent usage of
the RFID.The end product is a fully working system tested in the factory of the
manufacturing partner MOBICA. This report addresses the logical and technical
structure,as well as the technology constraints that should be considered in
such systems, and the implementation stages of the project"
"Human and artificial organizations may be described as networks of
interacting parts. Those parts exchange data and control information and, as a
result of these interactions, organizations produce emergent behaviors and
purposes -- traits the characterize ""the whole"" as ""greater than the sum of its
parts"". In this chapter it is argued that, rather than a static and immutable
property, emergence should be interpreted as the result of dynamic interactions
between forces of opposite sign: centripetal (positive) forces strengthening
emergence by consolidating the whole and centrifugal (negative) forces that
weaken the social persona and as such are detrimental to emergence. The result
of this interaction is called in this chapter as ""quality of emergence"". This
problem is discussed in the context of a particular class of organizations:
conventional hierarchies. We highlight how traditional designs produce
behaviors that may severely impact the quality of emergence. Finally we discuss
a particular class of organizations that do not suffer from the limitations
typical of strict hierarchies and result in greater quality of emergence. In
some case, however, these enhancements are counterweighted by a reduced degree
of controllability and verifiability."
"Blood Donation and Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) are crucial for saving
people lives. Recently, worldwide efforts have been undertaken to utilize
social media and smartphone applications to make the blood donation process
more convenient, offer additional services, and create communities around blood
donation centers. Blood banks suffer frequent shortage of blood; hence,
advertisements are frequently seen on social networks urging healthy
individuals to donate blood for patients who urgently require blood
transfusion. The blood donation process usually consumes a lot of time and
effort from both donors and medical staff since there is no concrete
information system that allows donors and blood donation centers communicate
efficiently and coordinate with each other to minimize time and effort required
for blood donation process. Moreover, most blood banks work in isolation and
are not integrated with other blood donation centers and health organizations
which affect the blood donation and blood transfusion services quality. This
work aims at developing a Blood Donation System (BDS) based on the cutting-edge
information technologies of cloud computing and mobile computing."
"The focus of this research was to use Educational Data Mining (EDM)
techniques to conduct a quantitative analysis of students interaction with an
e-learning system through instructor-led non-graded and graded courses. This
exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short
courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning
system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means
clustering method according to their course access log records. The results
explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners
in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the
difference in the learning environments could change the online access
behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into
five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups,
the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9%
and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from
the rest of the groups."
"The idea to unite smartphones used as personal environmental sensors and
health indicators into a scalable network for data collection and processing by
the internet-cloud is proposed. Access to the sensors, which are available in
every smartphone, will provide the appropriate software. Such a monitoring at
the global level would reveal the impact of the electromagnetic radiation,
environmental pollution and weather factors on human health. Participation of
students in these measurements increases their educational and social
activities."
"This paper describes an immersive and interactive visualization environment
that uses light as a metaphor for psychological phenomena. Creative life force
is portrayed as ambient light, and peoples' psyches are represented by spheres
that amplify and transform light. Personality characteristics, situations, and
relationships are systematically depicted using a systematic visual language
based on the properties of light and how it interacts with physical objects.
The technology enables users to visualize and creatively experiment with
light-based representations of themselves and others, including patterns of
interaction and how they have come about, and how they could change and unfold
in the future."
"In today's mobile application marketplace, the ability of consumers to make
informed choices regarding their privacy is extremely limited. Consumers
largely rely on privacy policies and app permission mechanisms, but these do an
inadequate job of conveying how information will be collected, used, stored,
and shared. Mobile application developers go largely unrewarded for making apps
more privacy conscious as it is difficult to communicate these features to
consumers while they are searching for a new app. This paper provides an
overview of a framework designed to help consumers make informed choices, and
an incentive mechanism to encourage app developers to implement it. This
framework includes machine readable privacy policies encouraged by mobile app
stores and enhanced by user software agents. Such a framework would provide the
foundation required for more advanced forms of privacy management to develop."
"The shallow and fragile knowledge on the Web does not examine in depth the
things: it behaves lightly. The conditions created by the Web makes our
attention labile and especially fickle, it's unable to concentrate for long as
we are trained to ""surf"" without going though never in depth. The Web also
brings with it the added advantage of a nearly availability infinite knowledge
but leads to a loss of the ability to retain and evaluate that knowledge within
us increasing forgetfulness of knowledge. In this paper we show how the
""function of forgetfulness"" appears linked to tedium and oblivion of knowledge
through the liquidity of ontology matching."
"This paper proposes a new method of data handling as well as implementation
of management system for an academic department. Management system is a proven
framework for managing and continually improving the organizations policies,
procedures and processes. Department of Sri Lankan Universities is a division
within a faculty comprising one subject area or a number of related subject
areas. The time consumption and error rate of producing information is
extremely high. This paper describes how to do the data handling in a
department of Sri Lankan Universities using the management system. The
efficiency of the management system measured with the amount of data handled by
the department. Experiment results shows that this method of data handling
increase the efficiency of the department in terms of processing information
and the reduction of risks involved with the department activities."
"Facebook is only an electronic communication between human but unfortunately
it has become an addiction for all. This paper examines the usage of Facebook
among university students and its influence in their academic performance. The
impact of Facebook can either be good or bad on university students and in
their academic activities. Even though a closer look on the real impact of
Facebook reveals that it leads to several problems in university students
academic performances. Today Facebook is somehow destroying the future and
academic carrier of university students. At the same time also intended to find
the significance of use of Facebook by University students in their academic
success with the help of a survey conducted to collect the data among more than
250 students of different Universities in Sri Lanka."
"Fires, lights at night and mobile phone activity have been separately used as
proxy indicators of human activity with high potential for measuring human
development. In this preliminary report, we develop some tools and
methodologies to identify and visualize relations among remote sensing datasets
containing fires and night lights information with mobile phone activity in
Cote D'Ivoire from December 2011 to April 2012."
"The integration of new technologies in the classrooms opens new possibilities
for the teaching and learning process. Technologies such as student response
system (e.g. Clicker) are getting popularity among teachers due to its effects
on student learning performance. In this study, our primary objective is to
investigate the effect of Socrative with combination of smartphones on student
learning performance. We also observed the benefits of interactivity between
the teacher and the students and among classmates, which positively influences
collaborative learning and engagement of students in the class. We test these
relationships experimentally in a community college class environment using
data from a survey answered by students in information technology associate
degree. The results of our study reveal that collaborative learning and
engagement of student in the class improves student learning performance. We
highly recommend these tools in educational settings to support the learning
process."
"The continuous increase of data generated provides enormous possibilities of
both public and private companies. The management of this mass of data or big
data will play a crucial role in the society of the future, as it finds
applications in different fields. There are so much potential and extremely
useful insights hidden in the huge volume of data. The advanced analysis
techniques available including predictive analytics, text mining, semantic
analysis are needed to enable organizations to create a competitive advantage
through data analyzed with different levels of sophistication, speed and
accuracy previously unavailable. Therefore, is it still possible to have that
level of sophistication with the ubiquitous numeric ocean that accompanies use
every day via connected devices that invade our lives? However, development of
big data requires a good understanding of the issues associated with it. And
this is the purpose of this paper, which focuses on giving a close-up view of
big data analysis, opportunities and challenges."
"This work is an implementation of a multifactor authentication SMS based
result checking system. The objectives of this work were to improve on the
available authentication methods and apply it on examination result checking
system. The work takes care of only course codes with their grades, the current
GPA and the overall CGPA. It employs the Pull SMS service, built on an
independent service and a modem. Examination results consist of sensitive
information, hence the need to further enhance the ones already in place so as
to ensure further privacy and integrity, In the course of this project, the
following assumptions were made: That a system that does the computation of
students' result, calculate of GPA and CGPA is already in place. The
implemented system was connected to the database of the existing system. A
database that contains the bio-data of each student admitted exists. That SMTP
(Simple Mail Transport Protocol) modem exists and should have been used but to
reduce cost, a modem that can act like a SIM browser is used with a standard
SIM card inserted in it and connected via cable to the application server. The
system showed that further security and privacy could be achieved when
multifactor authentication is employed. For further work, the system could be
developed and built as a dependent service which involves having the
application server connected to the service provider's SMS Center (SMSC).

"We propose there is a need for a technical platform enabling people to engage
with the collection, management and consumption of personal data; and that this
platform should itself be personal, under the direct control of the individual
whose data it holds. In what follows, we refer to this platform as the Databox,
a personal, networked service that collates personal data and can be used to
make those data available. While your Databox is likely to be a virtual
platform, in that it will involve multiple devices and services, at least one
instance of it will exist in physical form such as on a physical form-factor
computing device with associated storage and networking, such as a home hub."
"This study examines the use of Facebook Markup Language (FBML) to design an
e-learning model to facilitate teaching and learning in an academic setting.
The qualitative research study presents a case study on how, Facebook is used
to support collaborative activities in higher education. We used FBML to design
an e-learning model called processes for e-learning resources in the Specialist
Learning Resources Diploma (SLRD) program. Two groups drawn from the SLRD
program were used; First were the participants in the treatment group and
second in the control group. Statistical analysis in the form of a t-test was
used to compare the dependent variables between the two groups. The findings
show a difference in the mean score between the pre-test and the post-test for
the treatment group (achievement, the skill, trends). Our findings suggest that
the use of FBML can support collaborative knowledge creation and improved the
academic achievement of participatns. The findings are expected to provide
insights into promoting the use of Facebook in a learning management system
(LMS)."
"This research is endeavoring to design an e-learning web site on the internet
having the course name as ""Object Oriented Programming"" (OOP) for the students
of level four at Computer Science Department (CSD). This course is to be taught
online (through web) and then a programme is to be designed to evaluate
students performance electronically while introducing a comparison between
online teaching , e-evaluation and traditional methods of evaluation. The
research seeks to lay out a futuristic perception that how the future online
teaching and e-electronic evaluation should be the matter which highlights the
importance of this research."
"The Multi Agent Based programming, modeling and simulation environment of
NetLogo has been used extensively during the last fifteen years for educational
among other purposes. The learning subject, upon interacting with the Users
Interface of NetLogo, can easily study properties of the simulated natural
systems, as well as observe the latters response, when altering their
parameters. In this research, NetLogo was used under the perspective that the
learning subject (student or prospective teacher)interacts with the model in a
deeper way, obtaining the role of an agent. This is not achieved by obliging
the learner to program (write NetLogo code) but by interviewing them, together
with applying the choices that they make on the model. The scheme was carried
out, as part of a broader research, with interviews, and web page like
interface menu selections, in a sample of 17 University students in Athens
(prospective Primary School teachers) and the results were judged as
encouraging. At a further stage, the computers were set as a network, where all
the agents performed together. In this way the learners could watch onscreen
the overall outcome of their choices and actions on the modeled ecosystem. This
seems to open a new, small, area of research in NetLogo educational
applications."
"Electricity market mechanisms designed to steer sustainable generation of
electricity play an important role for the energy transition intended to
mitigate climate change. One of the major problems is to complement volatile
renewable energy sources by operationally flexible capacity reserves. In this
paper a proposal is given to determine prices on electricity markets taking
into account the operational flexibility of power plants, such that the costs
of long-term capacity reserves can be paid by short-term electricity spot
markets. For this purpose, a measure of operational flexibility is introduced
enabling to compute an inflexibility fee charging each individual power plant
on a wholesale electricity spot market. The total sum of inflexibility fees
accumulated on the spot markets then can be used to finance a capacity market
keeping the necessary reserves to warrant grid reliability. Here each reserve
power plant then gets a reliability payment depending on its operational
flexibility. The proposal is applied to a small exemplary grid, illustrating
its main idea and also revealing the caveat that too high fees paradoxically
could create incentives to employ highly flexible power plants on the spot
market rather than to run them as backup capacity."
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network
consisting of internet-connected objects, such as Radio-frequency
identification (RFIDs), sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and
smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the future
internet. Over the last decade, we have seen a large number of the IoT
solutions developed by start-ups, small and medium enterprises, large
corporations, academic research institutes (such as universities), and private
and public research organisations making their way into the market. In this
paper, we survey over one hundred IoT smart solutions in the marketplace and
examine them closely in order to identify the technologies used,
functionalities, and applications. More importantly, we identify the trends,
opportunities and open challenges in the industry-based the IoT solutions.
Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under
five different categories: smart wearable, smart home, smart, city, smart
environment, and smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a
guideline and conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to
motivate and inspire further developments. It also provides a systematic
exploration of existing research and suggests a number of potentially
significant research directions."

"The Internet of Things, or the IoT is a vision for a ubiquitous society
wherein people and ""Things"" are connected in an immersively networked computing
environment, with the connected ""Things"" providing utility to
people/enterprises and their digital shadows, through intelligent social and
commercial services. Translating this idea to a conceivable reality is a work
in progress for more than a decade. Current IoT architectures are predicated on
optimistic assumptions on the evolution and deployment of IoT technologies. We
believe many of these assumptions will not be met, consequently impeding the
practical and sustainable deployment of IoT. In this article, we explore
use-cases across different applications domains that can potentially benefit
from an IoT infrastructure, and analyze them in the context of an alternative
world-view that is more grounded in reality. Despite this more conservative
approach, we argue that adopting certain design paradigms when architecting an
IoT ecosystem can achieve much of the promised benefits in a practical and
sustainable manner."
"An area presenting new opportunities for both legitimate business, as well as
criminal organizations, is Cloud computing. This work gives a strong background
in current digital forensic science, as well as a basic understanding of the
goal of Law Enforcement when conducting digital forensic investigations. These
concepts are then applied to digital forensic investigation of cloud
environments in both theory and practice, and supplemented with current
literature on the subject. Finally, legal challenges with digital forensic
investigations in cloud environments are discussed."
"We are experiencing an abundance of Internet-of-Things (IoT) middleware
solutions that provide connectivity for sensors and actuators to the Internet.
To gain a widespread adoption, these middleware solutions, referred to as
platforms, have to meet the expectations of different players in the IoT
ecosystem, including device providers, application developers, and end-users,
among others. In this article, we evaluate a representative sample of these
platforms, both proprietary and open-source, on the basis of their ability to
meet the expectations of different IoT users. The evaluation is thus more
focused on how ready and usable these platforms are for IoT ecosystem players,
rather than on the peculiarities of the underlying technological layers. The
evaluation is carried out as a gap analysis of the current IoT landscape with
respect to (i) the support for heterogeneous sensing and actuating
technologies, (ii) the data ownership and its implications for security and
privacy, (iii) data processing and data sharing capabilities, (iv) the support
offered to application developers, (v) the completeness of an IoT ecosystem,
and (vi) the availability of dedicated IoT marketplaces. The gap analysis aims
to highlight the deficiencies of today's solutions to improve their integration
to tomorrow's ecosystems. In order to strengthen the finding of our analysis,
we conducted a survey among the partners of the Finnish IoT program, counting
over 350 experts, to evaluate the most critical issues for the development of
future IoT platforms. Based on the results of our analysis and our survey, we
conclude this article with a list of recommendations for extending these IoT
platforms in order to fill in the gaps."

conducted trough the results of an investigative study of information used as
basis for strategic decisions inside three different companies."
"Governments across the globe are facing challenging times to generate more
revenue because of the economic slowdown and to balance their budgets. There is
a growing need to find new ways of revenue generation as spending cuts and

during difficult economic times. Internet Today is seen more as a necessary
commodity and nobody can deny the fact that the Internet has improved peoples

transactions carried out are something thats not taxed."
"As digital goods and services become an integral part of modern day society,
the demand for a standardized and ubiquitous form of digital currency
increases. And it is not just about digital goods; the adoption of electronic
and mobile commerce has not reached its expected level at all parts of the
globe as expected. One of the main reasons behind that is the lack of a
universal digital as well as virtual currency. Many countries in the world have
failed to realize the potential of e-commerce, let alone m-commerce, because of
rigid financial regulations and apparent disorientation & gap between monetary
stakeholders across borders and continents. Digital currency which is
internet-based, non-banks issued and circulated within a certain range of
networks has brought a significant impact on the development of e-commerce. The
research and analysis of this paper would focus on the feasibility of the
operation of a digital currency and its economic implications."
"In this work we describe a simple MATLAB based language which allows to

"Teachable Agent (TA) is a special type of pedagogical agent which
instantiates the educational theory of Learning by Teaching. Soon after its
emergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over
scaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students
to take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA
design also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions
with students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of
believability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive
learning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA,
Affective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and
implement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with
students with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of
pedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory
to design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors
of students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to
learn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and
Affectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage
them to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can
interact with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the
agent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an
educator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent
can perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators
into the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system,
which can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a
natural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base."
"Current outdoor localization techniques fail to provide the required accuracy
for estimating the car's lane. In this paper, we present LaneQuest: a system
that leverages the ubiquitous and low-energy inertial sensors available in
commodity smart-phones to provide an accurate estimate of the car's current
lane. LaneQuest leverages hints from the phone sensors about the surrounding
environment to detect the car's lane. For example, a car making a right turn
most probably will be in the right-most lane, a car passing by a pothole will
be in a specific lane, and the car's angular velocity when driving through a
curve reflects its lane. Our investigation shows that there are amble
opportunities in the environment, i.e. lane ""anchors"", that provide cues about
the car's lane. To handle the ambiguous location, sensors noise, and fuzzy lane
anchors; LaneQuest employs a novel probabilistic lane estimation algorithm.
Furthermore, it uses an unsupervised crowd-sourcing approach to learn the
position and lane-span distribution of the different lane-level anchors.
  Our evaluation results from implementation on different android devices and
260Km driving traces by 13 drivers in different cities shows that LaneQuest can
detect the different lane-level anchors with an average precision and recall of
more than 90%. This leads to an accurate detection of the exact car's lane
position 80% of the time, increasing to 89% of the time to within one lane.
This comes with a low-energy footprint, allowing LaneQuest to be implemented on
the energy-constrained mobile devices."
"In this study we investigate how quantification of Wikipedia biographies can
shed light on worldwide longitudinal gender inequality trends. We present an
academic index allowing comparative study of gender inequality through space
and time, the Wikipedia Gender Index (WIGI), based on metadata available
through the Wikidata database. Our research confirms that gender inequality is
a phenomenon with a long history, but whose patterns can be analyzed and
quantified on a larger scale than previously thought possible. Through the use
of Inglehart- Welzel cultural clusters, we show that gender inequality can be
analyzed with regards to world's cultures. In the dimension studied (coverage
of females and other genders in reference works) we show a steadily improving
trend, through one with aspects that deserve careful follow up analysis (such
as the surprisingly high ranking of the Confucian and South Asian clusters).

"In transport modeling and prediction, trip purposes play an important role
since mobility choices (e.g. modes, routes, departure times) are made in order
to carry out specific activities. Activity based models, which have been
gaining popularity in recent years, are built from a large number of observed
trips and their purposes. However, data acquired through traditional
interview-based travel surveys lack the accuracy and quantity required by such
models. Smartphones and interactive web interfaces have emerged as an
attractive alternative to conventional travel surveys. A smartphone-based
travel survey, Future Mobility Survey (FMS), was developed and field-tested in
Singapore and collected travel data from more than 1000 participants for
multiple days. To provide a more intelligent interface, inferring the
activities of a user at a certain location is a crucial challenge. This paper
presents a learning model that infers the most likely activity associated to a
certain visited place. The data collected in FMS contain errors or noise due to
various reasons, so a robust approach via ensemble learning is used to improve
generalization performance. Our model takes advantage of cross-user historical
data as well as user-specific information, including socio-demographics. Our
empirical results using FMS data demonstrate that the proposed method
contributes significantly to our travel survey application."
"The synergy between Big Data and Open Data has the potential to revolutionize
information access in the developing world. Following this mantra, we present
the analysis of more than a decade worth of open judgements and orders from the
Supreme Court of Pakistan. Our overarching goal is to discern the presence of
judicial activism in the country in the wake of the Lawyers' Movement. Using
Apache Spark as the processing engine we analyze hundreds of unstructured PDF
documents to sketch the evolution and various organs of judicial activism in
Pakistan since 2009. Our results show that the judiciary has indeed been
pursuing matters of public interest, especially those that pertain to the
fundamental rights of the citizens. Furthermore, we show how the size of the
presiding bench in a case and citations of Articles from the Constitution and
prior judgements can aid in classifying legal judgements. Throughout the
analysis we also highlight the challenges that anyone who aims to apply Big
Data techniques to Open Data will face. We hope that this work will be one in a
series of community efforts to use Open Data as a lens to analyze real-world
events and phenomena in the developing world."
"Renewable energy systems are an increasingly popular way to generate
electricity. As with any new technological paradigm, new challenges have
emerged which are unique to the utilization of renewable energy systems. One of
these challenges in particular is the development of effective monitoring
technologies to compensate for the decentralized nature of remote power
generation. This project details the development of an open-source monitoring
system for remote solar power systems. The problem space that this project is
specifically concerned with deals with the reduction of cost and the use of
open platforms to make solar monitoring viable in developing countries where
both the resources and general knowledge required to undertake such efforts are
particularly scarce.
  Currently, solar monitoring technologies are expensive, limited in their
application, and for the most part proprietary. It is arguable that such
systems can be developed using non-customized hardware and open-source software
that can be obtained and run anywhere in the world. This project is one such
argument. This proof of concept is sufficient to show that solar remote
monitoring is neither expensive nor particularly cumbersome to implement and
thus warrants further investigation and development by the open source
community."
"In this paper, by characterizing the Leg Agility (LA) task, which contributes
to the evaluation of the degree of severity of the Parkinson's Disease (PD),
through kinematic variables (including the angular amplitude and speed of
thighs' motion), we investigate the link between these variables and Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. Our investigation relies on
the use of a few body-worn wireless inertial nodes and represents a first step
in the design of a portable system, amenable to be integrated in Internet of
Things (IoT) scenarios, for automatic detection of the degree of severity (in
terms of UPDRS score) of PD. The experimental investigation is carried out
considering 24 PD patients."
"Using time series of US patents per million inhabitants, knowledge-generating
cycles can be distinguished. These cycles partly coincide with Kondratieff long
waves. The changes in the slopes between them indicate discontinuities in the
knowledge-generating paradigms. The knowledge-generating paradigms can be
modeled in terms of interacting dimensions (for example, in
university-industry-government relations) that set limits to the maximal
efficiency of innovation systems. The maximum values of the parameters in the
model are of the same order as the regression coefficients of the empirical
waves. The mechanism of the increase in the dimensionality is specified as
self-organization which leads to the breaking of existing relations into the
more diversified structure of a fractal-like network. This breaking can be
modeled in analogy to 2D and 3D (Koch) snowflakes. The boost of knowledge
generation leads to newly emerging technologies that can be expected to be more
diversified and show shorter life cycles than before. Time spans of the
knowledge-generating cycles can also be analyzed in terms of Fibonacci numbers.
This perspective allows for forecasting expected dates of future possible
paradigm changes. In terms of policy implications, this suggests a shift in
focus from the manufacturing technologies to developing new organizational
technologies and formats of human interactions"
"This work presents a method for the measurement of the accuracy of evidential
artifact extraction and categorization tasks in digital forensic
investigations. Instead of focusing on the measurement of accuracy and errors
in the functions of digital forensic tools, this work proposes the application
of information retrieval measurement techniques that allow the incorporation of
errors introduced by tools and analysis processes. This method uses a `gold
standard' that is the collection of evidential objects determined by a digital
investigator from suspect data with an unknown ground truth. This work proposes
that the accuracy of tools and investigation processes can be evaluated
compared to the derived gold standard using common precision and recall values.
Two example case studies are presented showing the measurement of the accuracy
of automated analysis tools as compared to an in-depth analysis by an expert.
It is shown that such measurement can allow investigators to determine changes
in accuracy of their processes over time, and determine if such a change is
caused by their tools or knowledge."
"As more businesses and users adopt cloud computing services, security
vulnerabilities will be increasingly found and exploited. There are many
technological and political challenges where investigation of potentially
criminal incidents in the cloud are concerned. Security experts, however, must
still be able to acquire and analyze data in a methodical, rigorous and
forensically sound manner. This work applies the STRIDE asset-based risk
assessment method to cloud computing infrastructure for the purpose of
identifying and assessing an organization's ability to respond to and
investigate breaches in cloud computing environments. An extension to the
STRIDE risk assessment model is proposed to help organizations quickly respond
to incidents while ensuring acquisition and integrity of the largest amount of
digital evidence possible. Further, the proposed model allows organizations to
assess the needs and capacity of their incident responders before an incident
occurs."
"Sales pipeline analysis is fundamental to proactive management of an
enterprize's sales pipeline and critical for business success. In particular,
win propensity prediction, which involves quantitatively estimating the
likelihood that on-going sales opportunities will be won within a specified
time window, is a fundamental building block for sales management and lays the
foundation for many applications such as resource optimization and sales gap
analysis. With the proliferation of big data, the use of data-driven predictive
models as a means to drive better sales performance is increasingly widespread,
both in business-to-client (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets.
However, the relatively small number of B2B transactions (compared with the
volume of B2C transactions), noisy data, and the fast-changing market
environment pose challenges to effective predictive modeling. This paper
proposes a machine learning-based unified framework for sales opportunity win
propensity prediction, aimed at addressing these challenges. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed system using data from a top-500 enterprize in the
business-to-business market."
"The development of technologies of multimedia, linked to that of Internet and
democratization of high speed, has made henceforth E-learning possible for
learners being in virtual classes and geographically distributed. One benefit
to taking course online is that the online course structure is typically more
student focused than teacher centered and encouraging more active participation
by students in collaborative learning activities. The quality and quantity of
asynchronous and synchronous communications are the key elements for E-learning
success. A potential problem that has received little exploration is student's
feeling of isolation. It is important to have a propitious supervision to
breaking down learner feeling isolation in E learning environment. This feeling
of isolation is among the main causes of loss and high rates of dropout in
E-learning. It impacts on their levels of participation, satisfaction and
learning. To overcome this feeling of isolation, we aim, by this research, to
provide the trainer and each learner with an environment allowing them to
behave as if being face to face; in other words, to approach the pedagogy of
classroom teaching. Our contribution to reduce the feeling of isolation is to
ensure the presence of the teacher in the educational tools. These tools aim to
establish a real dialogue with the learner, forcing him to take an active part
in their learning. Among the tools we offer, video conference Openmeeting
integrated in Moodle providing the possibility of using the notion of class and
whiteboard, the indicator of motivation quantification tool based hand gesture
that we developed and finally social networks web 2. 0 like Facebook, youtube,
twitter to promote collaboration, sharing and communication of the learner with
his peers."
"The phenomenal success of certain crowdsourced online platforms, such as
Wikipedia, is accredited to their ability to tap the crowd's potential to
collaboratively build knowledge. While it is well known that the crowd's
collective wisdom surpasses the cumulative individual expertise, little is
understood on the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced environment.
A proper understanding of the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced
environment would enable one in the better designing of such environments to
solicit knowledge from the crowd. Our experiment on crowdsourced systems based
on annotations shows that an important reason for the rapid knowledge building
in such environments is due to variance in expertise. First, we used as our
test bed, a customized Crowdsourced Annotation System (CAS) which provides a
group of users the facility to annotate a given document while trying to
understand it. Our results showed the presence of different genres of
proficiency amongst the users of an annotation system. We observed that the
ecosystem in crowdsourced annotation system comprised of mainly four categories
of contributors, namely: Probers, Solvers, Articulators and Explorers. We
inferred from our experiment that the knowledge garnering mainly happens due to
the synergetic interaction across these categories. Further, we conducted an
analysis on the dataset of Wikipedia and Stack Overflow and noticed the
ecosystem presence in these portals as well. From this study, we claim that the
ecosystem is a universal characteristic of all crowdsourced portals."
"We present a DSP simulation environment that will enable students to perform
laboratory exercises using Android mobile devices and tablets. Due to the
pervasive nature of the mobile technology, education applications designed for
mobile devices have the potential to stimulate student interest in addition to
offering convenient access and interaction capabilities. This paper describes a
portable signal processing laboratory for the Android platform. This software
is intended to be an educational tool for students and instructors in DSP, and
signals and systems courses. The development of Android JDSP (A-JDSP) is
carried out using the Android SDK, which is a Java-based open source
development platform. The proposed application contains basic DSP functions for
convolution, sampling, FFT, filtering and frequency domain analysis, with a
convenient graphical user interface. A description of the architecture,
functions and planned assessments are presented in this paper."
"Renewable energy systems are an increasingly popular way to generate
electricity around the world. As wind and solar technologies gradually begin to
supplant the use of fossil fuels as preferred means of energy production, new
challenges are emerging which are unique to the experience of decentralized
power generation. One such challenge is the development of effective monitoring
technologies to relay diagnostic information from remote energy systems to data
analysis centers. The ability to easily obtain, synthesize, and evaluate data
pertaining to the behavior of a potentially vast number of individual power
sources is of critical importance to the maintainability of the next generation
of intelligent grid infrastructure. However, the application space of remote
monitoring extends well beyond this. This paper details the development and
implementation of an open-source monitoring framework for remote solar energy
systems. The necessity for such a framework to be open is much better
understood when considered through the lens of the theoretical potential for
remote monitoring technologies in developing countries. The United States and
other industrialized nations in the so-called 'first world' are likely to be
slow to seriously adopt renewable energy on account of the massive investment
and infrastructural changes required for its integration into the existing
electrical grid. In countries where grid infrastructure is generally inadequate
or nonexistent, this barrier is far less of a concern, and renewable energy
technologies are viewed more as an enabling tool for progress than as a
disruptive and expensive technological tangent. In this context as well, remote
monitoring has a role to play."
"The continued amalgamation of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) into everyday
activities stimulates the idea that these devices will increasingly contribute
evidential importance in digital forensics cases. This study investigates the
extent to which GPS devices are being used in criminal and civil court cases in
the United Kingdom through the inspection of Lexis Nexis, Westlaw, and the
British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII) legal databases. The
research identified 83 cases which involved GPS evidence from within the United
Kingdom and Europe for the time period from 01 June 1993 to 01 June 2013. The
initial empirical analysis indicates that GPS evidence in court cases is rising
over time and the majority of those court cases are criminal cases."
"All over the world, the population in rural and semi-urban areas is a major
concern for policy makers as they require technology enablement most to get
elevated from their living conditions. Financial Inclusion projects are meant
to work in this area as well. However the reach of financial institutions in
those areas is much lesser than in urban areas in general. New policies and
strategies are being made towards making banking services more accessible to
the people in rural and semi-urban area. Technology, in particular Internet of
Things (IoT) and Mobility can play a major role in this context as an enabler
and multiplier. This paper discusses about an IoT and Mobility driven approach,
which the Financial Institutions may consider while trying to work on financial
inclusion projects."
"The outpatients department in a developing country is typically understaffed
and inadequately equipped to handle a large numbers of patients filing through
on an average day. The use of electronic medical record (EMR) systems can
resolve some of the longstanding medical inefficiencies common in developing
countries. This paper presents the design and implementation of a proposed
outpatient management system that enables efficient management of a patient's
medical details. We present a system to create appointments with medical
practitioners by integrating a proposed Android-based mobile application with a
selected open source EMR system. The application allows both the patient and
the medical practitioners to manage appointments and make use of the electronic
messaging facility to send reminders when the appointed time is approaching in
real-time. A mobile application prototype is developed and the road map for
implementation is also discussed."
"The 2013 outbreak of Dengue in Fiji resulted in an alarming number of deaths
and has been is a matter of serious concern. Dengue fever is a disease caused
by the four types of the Dengue virus serotypes and transmitted mostly from
mosquito bites. In Fiji, dengue diagnosis is only done in hospitals which are
slow and time consuming. It is also important to monitor the spread of Dengue.
Fiji needs an convenient method of monitoring the spread of Dengue. With
increase in affordable smartphones and better Internet coverage, there is scope
for a mobile application for Dengue fever monitoring and tracking. This paper
proposes a mobile application for Dengue monitoring based on global positioning
system (GPS) enabled mobile phone technology. It also provides an information
network that shows the spread of dengue which will allow health authorities to
quickly identify dengue infected areas in Fiji. A mobile application prototype
is developed and tested and the scope for further testing and implementation is
also given."
"Many creativity methods follow similar structures and principles. Design
Patterns capture such invariants of proven good practices and discuss why, when
and how creative thinking methods match various situations of collaboration.
Moreover patterns connect different forms with each other. Once we understand
the underlying structures of creative thinking processes we can facilitate
digital tools to support them. While such tools can foster the effective
application of established methods and even change their properties, tools can
also enable new patterns of collaboration."
"This paper analyzes peer-based learning and the concept of Scaffolding
represented in ethnographic case studies of ten female informants aged 20-25
participating in the cosplay community. Cosplay is a female-dominated niche
subculture of extreme fans and mavens, who are devoted to dressing up as
characters from manga, games, and anime. Cosplayers are highly conscious of
quality standards for costumes, makeup, and accessories. Cosplay events and
dedicated SNSs for cosplayers are a valuable venue for exchanging information
about costume making. First we frame this work as an effort to think about
their learning environment using the concept of connected learning by Ito et
al(2013). Then we share an overview of cosplay culture in Japan and our
methodologies based on interviews and fieldwork. The interview transcripts were
analyzed according to the Steps for coding and Theorization method, a
qualitative data analysis technique by Otani (2008). In this study, We focus on
their reciprocal learning and expanding the concept of Scaffolding."
"This paper presents a method for understanding personal ways of thinking and
doing in daily lives among different countries by mining their ways as patterns
in a sense of pattern language. Pattern language is a methodology of describing
tacit practical knowledge, where each pattern consists of context, problem, and
solution. In this paper, patterns mined from the workshops we held in the
following three countries: Japan, Korea, and the United States, are analysed.
The results demonstrate similarities and reflect characteristics of the
patterns of each country. We anticipate that this workshop can be used as a
method for better understanding of cultural similarities and features in the
light of practical knowledge in daily lives."
"The business model represents an increasingly important management concept.
However, progress in research related to the concept is currently inhibited
from inconsistencies in terms of formalizing and therewith also empirically
measuring the business model concept. Taking this as a starting point, this
paper offers a conceptualization for building a scalable database to rigorously
capture large samples of business models. The following contributions are made:
First, we suggest a concept for dimensions to be modeled in the database.
Second, we discuss issues critical to the scalability of such an endeavor.
Third, we point to empirical and simulation-based studies enabled by the

"We present a large-scale analysis of Instagram pictures taken at 164,753
restaurants by millions of users. Motivated by the obesity epidemic in the
United States, our aim is three-fold: (i) to assess the relationship between
fast food and chain restaurants and obesity, (ii) to better understand people's
thoughts on and perceptions of their daily dining experiences, and (iii) to
reveal the nature of social reinforcement and approval in the context of
dietary health on social media. When we correlate the prominence of fast food
restaurants in US counties with obesity, we find the Foursquare data to show a
greater correlation at 0.424 than official survey data from the County Health
Rankings would show. Our analysis further reveals a relationship between small
businesses and local foods with better dietary health, with such restaurants
getting more attention in areas of lower obesity. However, even in such areas,
social approval favors the unhealthy foods high in sugar, with donut shops
producing the most liked photos. Thus, the dietary landscape our study reveals
is a complex ecosystem, with fast food playing a role alongside social
interactions and personal perceptions, which often may be at odds."
"Purpose - To qualify the significance of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations
theory with regard to Virtual Learning Environments. To apply an existing
Diffusion of Innovations instrument on a case organisation, the Royal
University of Bhutan (RUB), in order to compare its results with previous
findings. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were deployed
to analyze adopter group memberships and predictor significance in Virtual
Learning Environment adoption and use. Findings - The Diffusion of Innovations
theory is not stable across organizations when it comes to predicting different
user categories or the distribution of users. However, it was possible to
achieve reliable results for virtual learning environments within a particular
organization. Research limitations ND implications - The study questions
scholarly attempts to establish models of this type across organizations.
Practical implications - Professionals should be aware that
cross-organizational generalizations from Diffusion Of Innovation findings
within the domain of virtual learning environments may be very unreliable.
Originality and value - The study challenges the massively cited Diffusion of
Innovation literature. It provides data from Bhutan, which is underrepresented
in empirical investigations."
"A prerequisite for integrated land and water resources management (ILWRM) is
a holistic river basin assessment. The latter requires information and data
from different scientific disciplines but also appropriate data management
systems to store and manage historical and real time data, set up protocols
that facilitate data and information access and sharing among different
stakeholders, and triggering further collaboration among different institutions
in support of watershed-based assessment, management and planning. In West
Africa in general and especially in the transboundary Volta River basin where
different environmental data are collected and managed by different agencies in
different countries and also where data access and dissemination are very
challenging and difficult tasks, comprehensive river basin information systems
are required. This paper presents the Oti River Basin Information System
(OtiRBIS), a web-based data storage, management andanalysis platform that
addresses these needs and facilitates ILWRM implementation in the Kara river
basin."
"Film and television play an important role in popular culture, however
studies that require watching and annotating video are time-consuming and
expensive to run at scale. We explore information mined from media database
cast lists to explore onscreen gender depictions and how they change over time.
We find differences between web-mediated onscreen gender proportions and those
from US Census data. We propose these methodologies are a useful adjunct to
traditional analysis that allow researchers to explore the relationship between
online and onscreen gender depictions."
"In our project we have designed an Android application to obtain mobility
data of the citizens in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Our implementation
synchronously obtains in background on the one hand, periodic location updates
and, on the other hand, the type of activity citizens are doing. At the end of
the day, all this data is processed and sent to a server where are stored to
obtain mobility patterns from citizens that could help to improve the current
transportation infrastructure. MobilitApp is fully functional and stable
although the results can be improved in some situations. In future releases we
will implement machine learning technics to obtain significant improvements,
especially in the activity recognition modules."
"Managing health-care records and information is an imperative necessity. Most
patient health records are stored in separate systems and there are still huge
paper trails of records that health-care providers must keep to comply with
different regulations. This paper proposes an RFID-based system, named SIMOPAC,
that integrate RFID technology in health care in order to make patient
emergency care as efficient and risk-free as possible, by providing doctors
with as much information about a patient as quickly as possible. Every hospital
could use SIMOPAC with their existing system in order to promote patient safety
and optimize hospital workflow. We will concentrate on the RFID technology and
how it could be used in emergency care. We describe a general purpose
architecture and data model that is designed for collecting ambulatory data
from various existing devices and systems, as well as for storing and
presenting clinically significant information to the emergency care physician."
"The aim of this paper consists in defining the hardware and software
architecture of an embedded system, based on RFID technology, in order to
identify patients and to achieve real time information concerning the patients
biometric data, which might be used in different points of the health system
(laboratory, family physician, etc.)."
"The paper summarizes our preliminary findings regarding the development and
implementation of a newly proposed system based on ICT and RFID (Radio
Frequency Identification) technologies for campus access and facility usage. It
is generally acknowledged that any educational environment is highly dependent
upon a wide range of resources or variables such as teaching staff, research
and study areas, meeting and accommodation facilities, library services,
restaurant and leisure facilities, etc. The system we have devised using ICT
and RFID technologies supports not only authentic transactions among all
university departments, but also interconnects all levels of academic life and
activity. Thus, the utility of the system ranges from access control (student/
staff/ visitor identification), attendance tracking, library check-out services
and voting to grade book consulting, inventory, cashless vending, parking,
laundry and copying services. Physically, the system consists of several RFID
gates/readers, a data server and some network stations, all of them requiring
specific structuring and integration solutions. The system is quite different
from already existing ones in that it proposes an innovative access solution.
Thus, the search of the ID card holder in a database has been replaced by local
processing. Since one and the same card is employed to perform a variety of
operations, the system has immediate and numerous utilizations."
"Todays students are encouraged to study and develop expertise in more than
one national academic environment. As a matter of fact, their educational
activities inevitably occur in a variety of academic settings and even span
several years. Consequently students academic results and progress are expected
to be easily monitored and accessed nationally. The authors of the present
paper have devised a student gradebook information network to be nationally
employed by all public and private universities and colleges. The papers deals
with the architectural principles underlying the system and discusses aspects
related to data collection, data analysis and data storage across multiple
machines while providing a seamless view of entire infrastructure and service
delivery system from a single Web access point. The utility of the
architectural system is discussed in relationship with its major advantages:
user-friendliness, security access, flexibility, transparency, distributional
power, and scalability. The major beneficiary of the system is the Romanian
higher education system."
"E-Learning uses electronic media, information & communication technologies to
provide education to the masses. E-learning deliver hypertext, text, audio,
images, animation and videos using desktop standalone computer, local area
network based intranet and internet based contents. While producing an
e-learning content or course-ware, a major decision making factor is whether to
use audio for the benefit of the end users. Generally, three types of audio can
be used in e-learning: narration, music and sound effect. This paper shows that
the use of proper audio based on contents type and subject can make the content
more interesting as well as help the end users to better understand the
contents."
"Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs are very important for e-learning.
Generally, MCQs are used as a tool for the assessment of student performance at
the end of their learning sessions. Can MCQs become an important tool in the
process of knowledge acquisition while attending a course? This paper intends
to find out how MCQs could be used as a tool for the better understanding,
coverage as well as knowledge acquisition."
"This paper investigates how retailers at different stages of e-commerce
maturity evaluate their entry to e-commerce activities. The study was conducted
using qualitative approach interviewing 16 retailers in Saudi Arabia. It comes
up with 22 factors that are believed the most influencing factors for retailers
in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, there seem to be differences between retailers
in companies at different maturity stages in terms of having different
attitudes regarding the issues of using e-commerce. The businesses that have
reached a high stage of e-commerce maturity provide practical evidence of
positive and optimistic attitudes and practices regarding use of e-commerce,
whereas the businesses that have not reached higher levels of maturity provide
practical evidence of more negative and pessimistic attitudes and practices.
The study, therefore, should contribute to efforts leading to greater
e-commerce development in Saudi Arabia and other countries with similar
context."
"Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs are very important for e-learning. Many MCQ
Tools allow us to generate MCQs very easily. However, in most of the cases they
are not portable. That means MCQs generated for one system cannot be used for
other unless a common format is used. So, collaboration and/or up gradation
becomes a time consuming tedious task. In this paper, we will examine how tool
could be designed which can produce portable MCQs and that too generating in
the laptop and/or desktop without any need for going online."
"Advances in sensing and computing capabilities are making it possible to
embed increasing computing power in small devices. This has enabled the sensing
devices not just to passively capture data at very high resolution but also to
take sophisticated actions in response. Combined with advances in
communication, this is resulting in an ecosystem of highly interconnected
devices referred to as the Internet of Things - IoT. In conjunction, the
advances in machine learning have allowed building models on this ever
increasing amounts of data. Consequently, devices all the way from heavy assets
such as aircraft engines to wearables such as health monitors can all now not
only generate massive amounts of data but can draw back on aggregate analytics
to ""improve"" their performance over time. Big data analytics has been
identified as a key enabler for the IoT. In this chapter, we discuss various
avenues of the IoT where big data analytics either is already making a
significant impact or is on the cusp of doing so. We also discuss social
implications and areas of concern."
"The process of electronic approach to writing and sending medical
prescription promises to improve patient safety, health outcomes, maintaining
patients privacy, promoting clinician acceptance and prescription security when
compared with the customary paper method. Traditionally, medical prescriptions
are typically handwritten or printed on paper and hand-delivered to
pharmacists. Paper-based medical prescriptions are generating major concerns as
the incidences of prescription errors have been increasing and causing minor to
serious problems to patients, including deaths. In this paper, intelligent
eprescription model that comprises a knowledge base of drug details and an
inference engine that can help in decision making when writing a prescription
was developed. The research implements the e-prescription model with
multifactor authentication techniques which comprises password and biometric
technology. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, using C-Sharp programming language,
and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database were employed in developing the systems
front end and back end respectively. This work implements a knowledge base to
the e-prescription system which has added intelligence for validating doctors
prescription and also added security feature to the e-prescription system."
"Medical images require immediate access by several physicians in different
places within a medical facility and access to a critically injured persons
medical image, such as the x-ray, on time can be a key factor in the diagnosis
and treatment of the patient. The electronic medical image archive system can
help to solve the problem faced in previous physical medium archiving, thus
increasing productivity and time which patients are attended to. In this paper,
simple but functional electronic medical image archive architecture was
proposed and implemented. The system was further evaluated in a hospital
setting by medical experts using sample patient image data. Results of the
system evaluation shows that electronic medical image archiving systems can
actually promote efficiency, quality improvement, provide timely availability
of radiologic images, image consultation, and image interpretation in emergent
and no emergent clinical care areas among other benefits"
"In this paper, we present our approach, called SATIS (Semantically AnnotaTed
Intentions for Services), relying on intentional process modeling and semantic
web technologies and models, to assist collaboration among the members of a
neurosciences community. The main expected result of this work is to derive and
share semantic web service specifications from a neuro-scientists point of view
in order to operationalise image analysis pipelines with web services."
"Combining online classes with the traditional classes foster the advantages
of both learning environments.The aim of this study was to examine the effects
of integrating face to face classes in fully online courses.Forty eight
undergraduate students studying at the e-learning center of a public university
in Iran were the subjects of this study.They were required to provide their
feedback on the inclusion of face to face component in their e-learning
classes.Data collected through open ended questions indicated that the most
dominant outcome of such a hybrid course on the students was the perception on
the sense of community.The findings suggest that students' high satisfaction on
blended learning courses was due to the fact that it promoted their sense of
community.This supports another conclusion of the study that face to face
classes and online classes are complementary and provide a balanced pedagogical
role for each other."
"The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector represents one of the
fundamental pillars in the trade field. It contributes significantly to raising
the economies of countries by providing significant numbers of job
opportunities, which are beneficial to directly supporting national economies.
One of the most important obstacles facing this sector in the information
technology era is the lack of online trading channels with consumers, which
require more financial support than the their capabilities. Therefore, e-Malls
might be one of the best low-cost solutions to overcome this obstacle. Also,
they provide electronic platforms that include most SME requirements for sales
via electronic channels as well as offer essential technical support. According
to a report published in 2013 by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the
percentage of SMEs is equivalent to 90% of the total number of companies in
Saudi Arabia, which is numbered at 848,500. The e-Mall is a modern idea in
Saudi Arabia that requires the use of the Disunion Of Innovation (DOI) approach
to diffuse e-Malls through determining companies requirements and difficulties.
Therefore, this paper focuses on the factors that help SMEs to adopt e-Malls. A
quantitative questionnaire was conducted on 108 companies in Saudi Arabia to
find what obstacles and requirements they face to adopt an e-Mall and focus on
the factors affecting the implementation of this system, which are divided into
organizational, technical and cultural factors."
"Nowadays, the student community is growing up with mobile devices and it has
becomes an integral part of their life. Devices such as smartphones, tablets,
and e-book readers connect users to access information and enabling instant
communication with others. The enormous growth and affordability of mobile
devices influenced their learning practices. Mobile technologies are playing a
significant role in students' academic activities. The factors like
convenience, flexibility, engagement, interactivity and easy-to-use enable
mobile learning more attractive to students. With these trends in mind, it is
important for the educators to inherit the mobile technologies in effective
teaching and learning. Our study explores the challenges that exist in
implementing the m-learning technologies in the teaching and learning practices
of higher educational institutions of Oman. Our study also addressed various
issue like adoption of technology, transition to new technology and issues
related to engaging students. Based on the outcomes of the study, a framework
has been formulated to address all the challenges that are identified for the
successful implementation of m-learning."
"A nationally representative study of video game play among adolescents in the
United States showed that 97% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years play computer,
web, and portable (or console) video games (Lenhart et al., 2008). We
hypothesized that if people play games as a regular exercise regime, gaming
will correlate with an improvement in their cognitive skills. For this
experiment, a few games that tested the logical reasoning and critical analysis
skills under a given time constraint were coded in Python using Pygame and were
played by a group of 7th grade students. In order to test whether there is a
relationship between gaming and test performance, we divided the students into
two groups and gave them tests before and after the experimentation period in
order to measure their improvement. One group played the games while the other
did not. In the group of students that played the games, an average improvement
of 62.19% was seen (p < 0.0001). The group that did not play the games only
improved their performance by an average of 18.51% (p = 0.0882)."
"Math is the backbone of any field. Still its a night mare for many. Recent
survey proves that many students become dropouts from their higher education
due to math courses. ICT is an enchanted word in the contemporary educational
environment. It made the learning process more entertaining and almost made the
knowledge loss negligible. Adopting the ICT in math courses are still in the
infant level. Hence its a challenge placed in front of the IT and academic
professionals teaching math to make a suitable ICT tools for math courses to
make the learning an amusing experience. In this paper we have highlighted
three main concepts which make the math classes in a fascinating way. The first
method is introducing revolutionary hybrid ebooks which make the reading with
both audio and video facilities. The second method is facilitating the flip
class room so that student may have anywhere-anytime learning experience.
Finally the recent trends in m-learning are using apps for math courses. We
have highlighted the improvement showed by the students based on the survey
conducted with two groups of students with m-learning tools and without
m-learning tools. Even though there are good improvements showed by the
students, we the researchers feel that few more improvements are required in
these methodologies. The suggestions for the same are made in the
recommendations and conclusion section."
"The word E transformed everything is this world, as well as the whole globe
itself. To a great extend this helps for eco friendly green world. In
educational field, electronic medium has played a major role. It influenced and
changed almost every component of it to electronic medium like e-book, online
courses, etc. Throughout the world, leading universities are offering online
courses voluntarily. Generally we refer to it as Massive Online Open Courses
(MOOCs). There are many debates going on related to success and consequences of
MOOCs. Many are highlighting that these courses are self-paced, economical, and
provide quality training to all irrespective of geographical constraints. But
many other academic people go against these points and keep listing many other
disadvantages of MOOCs. This paper explores the basics of MOOCs at the initial
section. Following section will deal with advantages and disadvantages of MOOCs
in general. We the researchers collected the details about the awareness of
MOOCs among teachers and students in a higher education institution in Oman. We
have also collected the details about MOOCs implementation and usage within
Oman educational society. Based on the collected information, we have evaluated
and presented the findings about MOOCs impact in Oman higher education. We have
felt that doing appropriate improvements in MOOCs may become an imperative
medium in Oman educational institutions. The suggestions are listed in the
discussion and recommendation section."
"A potential objective of every financial organization is to retain existing
customers and attain new prospective customers for long-term. The economic
behaviour of customer and the nature of the organization are controlled by a
prescribed form called Know Your Customer (KYC) in manual banking. Depositor
customers in some sectors (business of Jewellery/Gold, Arms, Money exchanger
etc) are with high risk; whereas in some sectors (Transport Operators,
Auto-delear, religious) are with medium risk; and in remaining sectors (Retail,
Corporate, Service, Farmer etc) belongs to low risk. Presently, credit risk for
counterparty can be broadly categorized under quantitative and qualitative
factors. Although there are many existing systems on customer retention as well
as customer attrition systems in bank, these rigorous methods suffers clear and
defined approach to disburse loan in business sector. In the paper, we have
used records of business customers of a retail commercial bank in the city
including rural and urban area of (Tangail city) Bangladesh to analyse the
major transactional determinants of customers and predicting of a model for
prospective sectors in retail bank. To achieve this, data mining approach is
adopted for analysing the challenging issues, where pruned decision tree
classification technique has been used to develop the model and finally tested
its performance with Weka result. Moreover, this paper attempts to build up a
model to predict prospective business sectors in retail banking."
"Current challenges in Electronic Government initiatives include performance
management, effective and efficient means of sharing information between

institutions and proposes a framework that can be effectively used in
implementing workflow systems in public institutions"
"Books are the best friends of human beings and make them a rational animal.
In this E-world our traditional books are losing their values. Recent surveys
are proving that the younger generations are not much interested in visiting
libraries and reading books due to their addiction towards the electronic
gadgets. Many publishers are now changed their strategy by publishing and
promoting ebooks. Academicians are also badly affected by this trend and they
are forced to motivate the students to improve their reading habits for their
better performance in the institutions and to be responsible citizens of a
country.
  There are many difficulties faced by the ebook readers and it discourages the
people to read an ebook for long time like a normal printed book. The main
objective of this paper is to introduce a hybrid Ebook which is capable of
having audio and video files also in it. This makes the people to read the
e-book with modern electronic formats. This multimedia facility makes the
people to read or listen or watch the ebooks for long time. We have quoted the
survey results which prove that the students prefer to read hybrid books than
normal ebooks or the printed handouts in College of Applied Sciences, Oman.
Still we feel these books should have few more facilities, so that people who
like traditional books will also adopt these ebooks, without losing the
satisfaction of reading printed books. These things are listed in the
recommendations and conclusion section."
"Computer networking is an important specialization in Information and
Communication Technologies. However imparting the right knowledge to students
can be a challenging task due to the fact that there is not enough time to
deliver lengthy labs during normal lecture hours. Augmenting the use of
physical machines with software tools help the students to learn beyond the
limited lab sessions within the environment of higher Institutions of learning
throughout the world. The Institutions focus mostly on effective use of
available resources i.e. a lab may have few lab sessions scheduled within a day
for different courses. Hence a particular lab session must begin and end on
time. A slow student who did not complete his/her lab exercise must vacate the
lab because another class is about to commence. Hence using free software tools
such as OPNET IT guru, Packet trace and NS2 will help the student to learn
beyond the College time. A Student will gain an insight into Computer
networking field by repeatedly doing the same labs at the comfort of his laptop
or PC at home, hence increasing deeper understanding into the subject. The main
objective of this paper is to explore the software tools which will enhance the
networks practical skills among higher education students at College of Applied
Sciences Salalah. The paper also discusses the methodologies of implementing
and executing lab sessions after the normal college hours. The limitations and
suggestions for the improvements are also specified at the end of this paper."

"Making use of Information and Communication Technology resources is deemed
necessary for students. With this, they need to demonstrate their competence in
using various technologies such as Prezi and PowerPoint to communicate
effectively and efficiently. Hence, their experiences in using these
presentation tools is important to assist them in their needs. In this study,
all the fourth year Bachelor of Science in Technology Communication Management
students who have used the PowerPoint and Prezi were the respondents. Survey
instruments were given to determine the experiences of students of these
technologies based on their familiarity, skills, and effectiveness in
delivering the reports and presentations. It was found out that students were
generally good in using these tools. On the other hand, following the basic
rules to use these presentation tools effectively has to be reinforced in the
classroom to enhance and enrich their learning in sharpening their skills on
presentation tools."
"This research report undertakes an interdisciplinary review of the concept of
""control"" (i.e. the idea that people should have greater ""control"" over their
data), proposing an analysis of this con-cept in the field of law and computer
science. Despite the omnipresence of the notion of control in the EU policy
documents, scholarly literature and in the press, the very meaning of this
concept remains surprisingly vague and under-studied in the face of
contemporary socio-technical environments and practices. Beyond the current
fashionable rhetoric of empowerment of the data subject, this report attempts
to reorient the scholarly debates towards a more comprehensive and refined
understanding of the concept of control by questioning its legal and technical
implications on data subject\^as agency."
"Students' satisfaction plays a vital role in success of an educational
institute. Hence, many educational institutes continuously improve their
service to produce a supportive learning environment to satisfy the student
need. For this reason, educational institutions collect student satisfaction
data to make decision about institutional quality, but till now it cannot be
determined because student satisfaction is a complex matter which is influenced
by variety of characteristics of students and institutions. There are many
studies have been performed to inspect student satisfaction in the form of
college services, programs, student accommodation facility, student-faculty
interaction, consulting hours etc. So, still we cannot have a standard method
to know what is going on about satisfaction in the case of a core course. In
this research we determined the attributes that heavily affect student
satisfaction in a core course of computer science and the current status of
other attributes as well."
"Information and Communication Technology is a compendium of interrelated
applications, products and services that can either deepen or alter gender
equality. It has successfully transformed education, businesses, healthcare,
entertainment, politics and good governance within the Global North; providing
equitable access to developmental framework driven by ICTs. However, in
drafting the core developmental objectives of sustainable development, there
has been considerable gender digital divide limiting women access to resources
based on their gender, ethnicity, socio-cultural bias and the rights to utilize
such resources for development. In realization of the United Nation Millennium
Development Goals within the Global South specifically Nigeria, women are often
marginalized or excluded from ICT policy drafting and imbalance associated with
ICT. This paper identifies and evaluates gender issues and information
communication technology, with focus on the challenges and prospects for women
empowerment in Nigeria. The study critically examined research literatures and
conducted research survey on the prospects and challenges of promoting gender
equality and women empowerment through ICTs; and identifies policy implication
for Nigeria. The research survey used a random sampling technique with a target
sample size of eighty respondents. Data gathered from the questionnaire was
analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 19, and the
result was presented using ANOVA, and descriptive analysis. The study reveal
gender inclusiveness in policy drafting as a key driver for socio-economic
development, improved healthcare and women empowerment in Nigeria. We recommend
a deliberate ICT policy that attract and encourages women participation in ICT
developmental framework."
"The idea of modern urban systems and smart cities requires monitoring and
careful analysis of different signals. Such signals can originate from
different sources and one of the most promising is the BTS, i.e. base
transceiver station, an element of mobile carrier networks. This paper presents
the fundamental problems of elicitation, classification and understanding of
such signals so as to develop context-aware and pro-active systems in urban
areas. These systems are characterized by the omnipresence of computing which
is strongly focused on providing on-line support to users/inhabitants of smart
cities. A method of analyzing selected elements of mobile phone datasets
through understanding inhabitants' behavioral fingerprints to obtain smart
scenarios for public transport is proposed. Some scenarios are outlined. A
multi-agent system is proposed. A formalism based on graphs that allows
reasoning about inhabitant behaviors is also proposed."
"This paper discusses the general state of information technology in New
Zealand society, current issues, and policies. It is a qualitative study that
reviews recent scholarly articles, periodicals, and surveys in order to create
an understanding of some of the information technology issues and trends in New
Zealand. After reviewing previous research, it assesses the potential existence
and nature of a 'digital divide' in New Zealand society whilst also evaluating
possible strategic responses to the issue. New Zealand society has rapidly
accepted emerging online trends as well as achieving an overall high level of
Internet provision nationally. Through government policy and education, this
small island nation has remained at the forefront of information technology and
can be considered somewhat of an e-democracy. However, despite these positives,
there is a risk of low-income communities being left behind as New Zealand
society becomes increasingly dependent on IT in the workplace and in
governmental administration."
"For money-like informational commodities the notions of architectural
adequacy and evolutionary adequacy are proposed as the first two stages of a
moneyness maturity hierarchy. Then three classes of informational commodities
are distinguished: exclusively informational commodities, strictly
informational commodities, and ownable informational commodities. For each
class money-like instances of that commodity class, as well as monies of that
class may exist.
  With the help of these classifications and making use of previous assessments
of Bitcoin, it is argued that at this stage Bitcoin is unlikely ever to evolve
into a money. Assessing the evolutionary adequacy of Bitcoin is perceived in
terms of a search through its design hull for superior design alternatives.
  An extensive comparison is made between the search for superior design
alternatives to Bitcoin and the search for design alternatives to a specific
and unconventional view on the definition of fractions."
"With large student enrollment, MOOC instructors face the unique challenge in
deciding when to intervene in forum discussions with their limited bandwidth.
We study this problem of instructor intervention. Using a large sample of forum
data culled from 61 courses, we design a binary classifier to predict whether
an instructor should intervene in a discussion thread or not. By incorporating
novel information about a forum's type into the classification process, we
improve significantly over the previous state-of-the-art.
  We show how difficult this decision problem is in the real world by
validating against indicative human judgment, and empirically show the
problem's sensitivity to instructors' intervention preferences. We conclude
this paper with our take on the future research issues in intervention."
"People are facing a flood of data today. Data are being collected at
unprecedented scale in many areas, such as networking, image processing,
virtualization, scientific computation, and algorithms. The huge data nowadays
are called Big Data. Big data is an all encompassing term for any collection of
data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process them using
traditional data processing applications. In this article, the authors present
a unique way which uses network simulator and tools of image processing to
train students abilities to learn, analyze, manipulate, and apply Big Data.
Thus they develop students handson abilities on Big Data and their critical
thinking abilities. The authors used novel image based rendering algorithm with
user intervention to generate realistic 3D virtual world. The learning outcomes
are significant."

"Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our daily life. Their
improved sensing and computing capabilities bring new opportunities for human
behavior monitoring and analysis. Most work so far has been focused on
detecting correlation rather than causation among features extracted from
smartphone data. However, pure correlation analysis does not offer sufficient
understanding of human behavior. Moreover, causation analysis could allow
scientists to identify factors that have a causal effect on health and
well-being issues, such as obesity, stress, depression and so on and suggest
actions to deal with them. Finally, detecting causal relationships in this kind
of observational data is challenging since, in general, subjects cannot be
randomly exposed to an event.
  In this article, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of a
generic quasi-experimental framework for conducting causation studies on human
behavior from smartphone data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by investigating the causal impact of several factors such as exercise, social
interactions and work on stress level. Our results indicate that exercising and
spending time outside home and working environment have a positive effect on
participants stress level while reduced working hours only slightly impact
stress."
"Mobile health applications (or mHealth apps, as they are commonly known) are
increasingly popular with both individual end users and user groups such as
physicians. Due to their ability to access, store and transmit personally
identifiable and sensitive information (e.g. geolocation information and
personal details), they are potentially an important source of evidentiary
materials in digital investigations. In this paper, we examine 40 popular
Android mHealth apps. Based on our findings, we propose a taxonomy
incorporating artefacts of forensic interest to facilitate the timely
collection and analysis of evidentiary materials from mobile devices involving
the use of such apps. Artefacts of forensic interest recovered include user
details and email addresses, chronology of user locations and food habits. We
are also able to recover user credentials (e.g. user password and four-digit
app login PIN number), locate user profile pictures and identify timestamp
associated with the location of a user."
"Dating apps for mobile devices, one popular GeoSocial app category, are
growing increasingly popular. These apps encourage the sharing of more personal
information than conventional social media apps, including continuous location
data. However, recent high profile incidents have highlighted the privacy risks
inherent in using these apps. In this paper, we present a case study utilizing
forensic techniques on nine popular proximity-based dating apps in order to
determine the types of data that can be recovered from user devices. We recover
a number of data types from these apps that raise concerns about user privacy.
For example, we determine that chat messages could be recovered in at least
half of the apps examined and, in some cases, the details of any users that had
been discovered nearby could also be extracted."
"This study seeks to understand the factors influencing the adoption of an
incident handling strategy by organisational cloud service users. We propose a
conceptual model that draws upon the Situation Awareness (SA) model and
Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to guide this research. 40 organisational
cloud service users in Malaysia were surveyed. We also conduct face-to-face
interviews with participants from four of the organisations. Findings from the
study indicate that four PMT factors (Perceived Vulnerability, Self-Efficacy,
Response Efficacy, and Perceived Severity) have a significantly influence on
the adoption of cloud incident handling strategy within the organisations. We,
therefore, suggest a successful adoption cloud incident handling strategy by
organisational cloud service users involves the nexus between these four PMT
factors. We also outline future research required to validate the model."

"The Aldrich Archive is a collection of technical and marketing material
covering the period from 1977 to 2000; the physical documents are in the
process of being digitised and made available on the internet. The Aldrich
Archive includes contemporaneous case studies of end-user computer systems that
were used for marketing purposes. This paper analyses these case studies of
innovative information systems 1980 - 1990 using a quantitative and qualitative
content analysis. The major aim of this research paper is to find out how
innovative information systems were marketed in the decade from 1980 to 1990.
The paper uses a double-step content analysis and does not focus on one method
of content analysis only. The reason for choosing this approach is to combine
the advantages of both quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The
results of the quantitative content analysis indicated that the focus of the
marketing material would be on information management / information supply. But
the qualitative analysis revealed that the focus is on monetary advantages. The
strong focus on monetary advantages of information technology seems typical for
the 1980s and 1990s. In 1987, Robert Solow stated you can see the computer age
everywhere but in the productivity statistics. This paradox caused a lot of
discussion: since the introduction of the IT productivity paradox the business
value of information technology has been the topic of many debates by
practitioners as well as by academics."
"To bridge the digital divide between the urban and rural regions, the
government of Cameroon has launched the Multipurpose Community Telecentres
(MCT). But this project does not seems to sustain the local development. The
aim of this study is threefold: to determine the ICT penetration in rural
Cameroon and Internet adoption; to evaluate the impact of MCTs in rural region
and to provide some recommendations for both the network planning and the
development of suitable services. The study considers two rural communities in
Cameroon. The results show that despite low incomes, and MCTs that are missing
their goal, there is some readiness of local populations to welcome ICT
projects in order to improve their daily life and activities. To design
sustainable ICT projects for those regions, we provide some recommendations
from network design to business strategy."
"Under the background of the new media era with the rapid development of
interactive advertising, this paper used case study method based on the summary
of the research of the communication effect of interactive advertising from
both domestic and foreign academia. This paper divided interactive advertising
into three types to examine ---- interactive ads on official website,
interactive ads based on SNS and interactive ads based on mobile media.
Furthermore, this paper induced and summarized a self-enhanced dissemination
mechanism of the interactive advertising, including three parts which are micro
level, meso level and macro level mechanism, micro level embodies core
interaction, inner interaction and outer interaction which reveal the whole
process of interact with contents, with people and with computer, and the
communication approach and spread speed shown in meso level which is
self-fission-type spread, finally in macro level the communication effect of IA
achieved the spiral increasing. In a word, this article enriches research
procedure of the interactive advertising communication effects."
"We describe an exploratory study on the use of markers set during a
synchronous collaborative interaction (reflection-in-action) for later
construction of reflection reports upon the collaboration that occurred
(reflection-on-action). During two sessions, pairs of students used the Visu
videoconferencing tool for synchronous interaction and marker setting
(positive, negative or free) and then individual report building on the
interaction (using markers or not). A quantitative descriptive analysis was
conducted on the markers put in action, on their use to reflect on action and
on the reflection categories of the sentences in these reports. Results show
that the students (1) used the markers equally as a note-taking and reflection
means during the interaction, (2) used mainly positive markers both to reflect
in and on action; (3) paid more attention in identifying what worked in their
interaction (conservative direction) rather than in planning on how to improve
their group work (progressive direction); (4) used mainly their own markers to
reflect on action, with an increase in the use of their partners's markers in
the second reflection reports; (5) reflected mainly on their partner in the
first reflection reports and more on themselves in the second reports to
justify themselves and to express their satisfaction."
"Regional development classification is one way to look at differences in
levels of development outcomes. Some frequently used methods are the shift
share, Gain index, the Iindex Williamson and Klassen typology. The development
of science in the field of data mining, offers a new way for regional
development data classification. This study discusses how the decision tree is
used to classify the level of development based on indicators of regional gross
domestic product (GDP). GDP Data Central Java and Banten used in this study.
Before the data is entered into the decision tree forming algorithm, both the
provincial GDP data are classified using Klassen typology. Three decision tree
algorithms, namely J48, NBTRee and REPTree tested in this study using
cross-validation evaluation, then selected one of the best performing
algorithms. The results show that the J48 has a better accuracy rate which is
equal to 85.18% compared to the algorithm NBTRee and REPTree. Testing the model
is done to the six districts / municipalities in the province of Banten, and
shows that there are two districts / cities are still at the development of the
status quadrant relatively underdeveloped regions, namely Kota Tangerang and
Kabupaten Tangerang. As for the Central Java Province, Kendal, Magelang,
Pemalang, Rembang, Semarang and Wonosobo are an area with a quadrant of
development also on the status of the region is relatively underdeveloped.
Classification model that has been developed is able to classify the level of
development fast and easy to enter data directly into the decision tree is
formed. This study can be used as an alternative decision support for policy
makers in order to determine the future direction of development."
"Determination quadrant development has an important role in order to
determine the achievement of the development of a district, in terms of the
sector's gross regional domestic product (GDP). The process of determining the
quadrant development typically uses Klassen rules based on its sector GDP. This
study aims to provide a new approach in the conduct of regional development
quadrant clustering using cluster techniques. Clustering is performed based on
the average value of the growth and development of a district contribution
compared with the average value and contribution of the development of the
province based on data in comparison with a year of data to be compared.
Testing models of clustering, performed on a dataset of two provinces, namely
Banten (as a data testing) and Central Java (as the training data), to see the
accuracy of the classification model proposed. The proposed model consists of
two learning methods in it, namely unsupervised (Self Organizing Map / SOM-NN)
method and supervised (Naive Bayess). SOM-NN method is used as a learning
engine to generate training data for the target Class that will be used in the
machine learning Naive Bayess. The results showed the clustering accuracy rate
of the model was 98.1%, while the clustering accuracy rate of the model results
compared to manual analysis shows the accuracy of the typology Klassen smaller,
ie 29.63%. On one side, clustering results of the proposed model is influenced
by the number and keagaraman data sets used."
"Computer programming was once thought of as a skill required only by
professional software developers. But today, given the ubiquitous nature of
computation and data science it is quickly becoming necessary for all
scientists and engineers to have at least a basic knowledge of how to program.
Teaching how to program, particularly to those students with little or no
computing background, is well-known to be a difficult task. However, there is
also a wealth of evidence-based teaching practices for teaching programming
skills which can be applied to greatly improve learning outcomes and the
student experience. Adopting these practices naturally gives rise to greater
learning efficiency - this is critical if programming is to be integrated into
an already busy geoscience curriculum. This paper considers an undergraduate
computer programming course, run during the last 5 years in the Department of
Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. The teaching
methodologies that were used each year are discussed alongside the challenges
that were encountered, and how the methodologies affected student performance.
Anonymised student marks and feedback are used to highlight this, and also how
the adjustments made to the course eventually resulted in a highly effective
learning environment."
"High school and college graduates seemingly are often battling for the
courses they should major in order to achieve their target career. In this
paper, we worked on suggesting a career path to a graduate to reach his/her
dream career given the current educational status. Firstly, we collected the
career data of professionals and academicians from various career fields and
compiled the data set by using the necessary information from the data.
Further, this was used as the basis to suggest the most appropriate career path
for the person given his/her current educational status. Decision trees and
string matching algorithms were employed to suggest the appropriate career path
for a person. Finally, an analysis of the result has been done directing to
further improvements in the model."
"Hospitals and health care organizations collect large amounts of detailed
health care data that is in high demand by researchers. Thus, the possessors of
such data are in need of methods that allow for this data to be released
without compromising the confidentiality of the individuals to whom it
pertains. As the geographic aspect of this data is becoming increasingly
relevant for research being conducted, it is important for an
\emph{anonymization} process to pay due attention to the geographic attributes
of such data. In this paper, a novel system for health care data anonymization
is presented. At the core of the system is the aggregation of an initial
regionalization guided by the use of a Voronoi diagram. We conduct a comparison
with another geographic-based system of anonymization, GeoLeader. We show that
our system is capable of producing results of a comparable quality with a much
faster running time."
"A look at how big data is transforming telemedicine to provide better care by
tapping into a larger source of patient information. Telemedicine will have a
profound impact on patient care, increase access and quality, and represent an
opportunity to keep health care costs down. Data generated by smart devices
will enable the real-time monitoring of chronic diseases, allowing optimal
dosage of drugs and improve patient outcomes."
"The Web Geometry Laboratory, (WGL), is a blended-learning, collaborative and
adaptive, Web environment for geometry. It integrates a well known dynamic
geometry system. In a collaborative session, exchange of geometrical and
textual information between the user engaged in the session is possible. In a
normal work session (stand-alone mode), all the geometric steps done by the
students are recorded, alongside the navigation information, allowing, in a
latter stage, their teachers to ""play back"" the students sessions, using that
info to assert the students level and adjust the teaching strategies to each
individual student. Teachers can register and begin using one of the public
servers, defining students, preparing materials to be released to the students,
open collaborative sessions, etc. Using an action research methodology the WGL
system is being developed, validated through case-studies, and further
improved, in a cycle where the implementation steps are intertwined with case
studies."
"This paper compares the risk factors for becoming a victim of two types of
phishing: high-tech phishing (using malicious software) and low-tech phishing
(using e-mails and telephone calls). These risk factors are linked to
possibilities for situational crime prevention. Data from a cybercrime victim
survey in the Netherlands (n=10,316) is used. Based on routine activity theory,
the multivariate analyses include thirty variables. The findings show
situational crime prevention has to be aimed at groups other than just the
users themselves. Criminals are primarily interested in popular online places
and the onus is on the owners of these virtual places to protect their visitors
from getting infected."
"Data aggregators collect large amount of information about individual users
and create detailed online behavioral profiles of individuals. Behavioral
profiles benefit users by improving products and services. However, they have
also raised concerns regarding user privacy, transparency of collection
practices and accuracy of data in the profiles. To improve transparency, some
companies are allowing users to access their behavioral profiles. In this work,
we investigated behavioral profiles of users by utilizing these access
mechanisms. Using in-person interviews (n=8), we analyzed the data shown in the
profiles, elicited user concerns, and estimated accuracy of profiles. We
confirmed our interview findings via an online survey (n=100). To assess the
claim of improving transparency, we compared data shown in profiles with the
data that companies have about users. More than 70% of the participants
expressed concerns about collection of sensitive data such as credit and health
information, level of detail and how their data may be used. We found a large
gap between the data shown in profiles and the data possessed by companies. A
large number of profiles were inaccurate with as much as 80% inaccuracy. We
discuss implications for public policy management."
"Determination of major specialization is important to lead the student to
focus on areas of study that are of interest as well as in accordance with its
academic credentials. Currently, the determination of major specialization is
done by asking directly to students, regardless of academic outcomes that have
been achieved in the previo us semester. This study discusses the development
of a hybrid model from fuzzy Mamdani and C4.5 algorithm to analyze the
determination of major specialization in informatics engineering courses of
Universities Raya Serang, where C4.5 algorithm is used as a shaper rule (rule)
which is used in the inference stage. Establishment of rules (decision tree)
performed using Weka applications, while for the determination of the decision
support analysis specialization majors using Mamdani fuzzy concept, the
application is done using the help of MATLAB. The results showed that 17 of the
126 students who either choose according to variable concentrations used in
this study."
"The advancement of information and communication technologies (ICT) has
triggered many ICT-enabled services. Regarding this service, the complementary
ICT system involves with customers' devices, industry-wide ICT development and
nation-wide ICT infrastructure, which are difficult for any individual
organization to control. The ICT predicament is the phenomenon that the
complementary ICT system is inferior in delivering the promised service quality
of new ICT-enabled service. With the ICT predicament, companies face the
decision-making dilemma in launching the new service or postponing the launch.
This study proposes a process to resolve the decision-making dilemma regarding
the ICT predicament."
"The aim of this study was to investigate if participants of Software
Carpentry (SC) get more done in less time. We asked 32 questions to assess 24
former participants to analyse if SC gave them the computing skills to
accomplish this. Our research shows that time was already saved during the
workshop as it could shorten the learning process of new skills. A majority of
participants were able to use these new skills straight away and thus could
speed up their day to day work."
"In recent years, online education has been considered as one of the most
widely used IT services. Researchers in this field face many challenges in the
realm of Electronic learning services. Nowadays, many researchers in the field
of learning and eLearning study curriculum planning, considering its complexity
and the various numbers of effective parameters. The success of a curriculum is
a multifaceted issue which needs analytical modelling for precise simulations
of the different learning scenarios. In this paper, parameters involved in the
learning process will be identified and a curriculum will be propounded.
Furthermore, a Curriculum model will be proposed using the behavior of the
user, based on the logs of the server. This model will estimate the success
rate of the users while taking courses. Authentic Bayesian networks have been
used for modelling. In order to evaluate the proposed model, the data of three
consecutive semesters of 117 MS IT Students of E-Learning Center of Amirkabir
University of Technology has been used. The assessment clarifies the effects of
various parameters on the success of curriculum planning."
"Exeat is a generic term commonly used to describe a period of absence from a
centre of learning either for entire day, or parts of a day for appointments,
interviews, open days and other fixtures in privately owned academic
environment. The current method of monitoring students movement is inefficient
and brings difficulty to the University Halls management checking students exit
or entry into the halls of residence as well as impersonation. By using nexus
combination of Ubiquitous Mobile Computing Technology through Mobile Short
Message Service and biometric fingerprint approach exeat management and
monitoring is quick and easy. Result after testing of the designed and
simulated system shows that exeat monitoring systems is less prone to forgery
as stakeholders are carried along, capable of preventing impersonation among
students, and provide absolute electronic compliance to the policy of issuing
exeat to students in the University Halls of Residence."
"This paper presents BREW (Breakable Web Application), a tool for teaching IT
Security. BREWs main teaching targets are identification and exploitation of
vulnerabilities, using technologies and methodologies for software auditing and
testing, and bug detection, fixation, and writing of secure code. Main
advantages of BREW include that it is easy to apply in practice, it is a
perfect tool to create and retain motivation, it corresponds to the demands of
the psychology of learning, and it can be used for a heterogeneous group of
students. BREW has been success- fully used for teaching IT Security in Germany
as well as on an Erasmus Project with international student groups."
"Do today's communication technologies hold potential to alleviate poverty?
The mobile phone's accessibility and use allows us with an unprecedented volume
of data on social interactions, mobility and more. Can this data help us better
understand, characterize and alleviate poverty in one of the poorest nations in
the world. Our study is an attempt in this direction. We discuss two concepts,
which are both interconnected and immensely useful for securing the important
link between mobile accessibility and poverty.
  First, we use the cellular-communications data to construct virtual
connectivity maps for Senegal, which are then correlated with the poverty
indicators to learn a model. Our model predicts poverty index at any spatial
resolution. Thus, we generate Poverty Maps for Senegal at an unprecedented
finer resolution. Such maps are essential for understanding what characterizes
poverty in a certain region, and how it differentiates from other regions, for
targeted responses for the demographic of the population that is most needy. An
interesting fact, that is empirically proved by our methodology, is that a
large portion of all communication, and economic activity in Senegal is
concentrated in Dakar, leaving many other regions marginalized.
  Second, we study how user behavioral statistics, gathered from
cellular-communications, correlate with the poverty indicators. Can this
relationship be learnt as a model to generate poverty maps at a finer
resolution? Surprisingly, this relationship can give us an alternate poverty
map, that is solely based on the user behavior. Since poverty is a complex
phenomenon, poverty maps showcasing multiple perspectives, such as ours,
provide policymakers with better insights for effective responses for poverty
eradication."
"Knowledge Management (KM) is an approach to achieving strategic objectives by
visualizing, sharing, and using intangible resources of an organization and its
stakeholders. There are many studies that analyze specific factors for the
successful implementation of KM programs, and the evaluation of such factors is
considered a strategic tool for Public Organizations (POs) for efficiently
directing the implementation of a KM program. Nevertheless, there are cultural
problems such as weak trust, bad collaboration; technological problems as KM
systems difficult to use, nor interconnected or interoperable; and strategic
problems as political changes, not inter-administration continuity or lack of
political willingness. In this research we provide an overview of the key
factors for facilitating the implementation of KM programs. To this end, we
conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of success factors to create a
KM program for POs. Analyzing the twenty related studies we summarize benefits
and quality attributes of KM. Moreover, we obtained from an ongoing project
evaluation results of the KM factors ranked cultural, technological and
strategic. The results show that the Mexican POs have strategic and
technological issues such as: a misalignment between knowledge management and
organizational goals, it seems that POs are barely reusing their knowledge to
execute their daily activities or to take decisions, and is not possible to
know who and how a knowledge asset has been used. Finally, according to the
gaps and difficulties of the SLR, we provide strategies to successfully
implement KM programs in Mexico."
"Android devices continue to grow in popularity and capability meaning the
need for a forensically sound evidence collection methodology for these devices
also increases. This chapter proposes a methodology for evidence collection and
analysis for Android devices that is, as far as practical, device agnostic.
Android devices may contain a significant amount of evidential data that could
be essential to a forensic practitioner in their investigations. However, the
retrieval of this data requires that the practitioner understand and utilize
techniques to analyze information collected from the device. The major
contribution of this research is an in-depth evidence collection and analysis
methodology for forensic practitioners."
"A worldwide increase in proportions of older people in the population poses
the challenge of managing their increasing healthcare needs within limited
resources. To achieve this many countries are interested in adopting telehealth
technology. Several shortcomings of state-of-the-art telehealth technology
constrain widespread adoption of telehealth services. We present an
ensemble-sensing framework - wHealth (short form of wireless health) for
effective delivery of telehealth services. It extracts personal health
information using sensors embedded in everyday devices and allows effective and
seamless communication between patients and clinicians. Due to the
non-stigmatizing design, ease of maintenance, simplistic interaction and
seamless intervention, our wHealth platform has the potential to enable
widespread adoption of telehealth services for managing elderly healthcare. We
discuss the key barriers and potential solutions to make the wHealth platform a
reality."
"The creation of popular science web videos on the Internet has increased in
recent years. The diversity of formats, genres, and producers makes it
difficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not
every producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an
institutional sense, and professionalism and success on video platforms no
longer depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs.
Entertainment, content quality, and authenticity have become the keys to
community building and success. The democratization of science video production
allows a new variety of genres, styles, and forms. This article provides a
first overview of the typologies and characteristics of popular science web
videos. To avoid a misleading identification of science web videos with
institutionally produced videos, we steer clear of the term science
communication video, since many of the actual producers are not even familiar
with the academic discussion on science communication, and since the subject
matter does not depend on political or educational strategies. A content
analysis of 200 videos from 100 online video channels was conducted. Several
factors such as narrative strategies, video editing techniques, and design
tendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of
montage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to
an increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of
institutional or personal commitments: in general, it can be said that supposed
amateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. This
study represents an important step in understanding the essence of current
popular science web videos and provides an evidence-based definition as a
helpful cornerstone for further studies on science communication within this
kind of new media."
"Nairobi is one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities and a major
business and technology powerhouse in Africa. However, Nairobi currently lacks
monitoring technologies to obtain reliable data on traffic and road
infrastructure conditions. In this paper, we investigate the use of mobile
crowdsourcing as means to gather and document Nairobi's road quality
information. We first present the key findings of a city-wide road quality
survey about the perception of existing road quality conditions in Nairobi.
Based on the survey's findings, we then developed a mobile crowdsourcing
application, called CommuniSense, to collect road quality data. The application
serves as a tool for users to locate, describe, and photograph road hazards. We
tested our application through a two-week field study amongst 30 participants
to document various forms of road hazards from different areas in Nairobi. To
verify the authenticity of user-contributed reports from our field study, we
proposed to use online crowdsourcing using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to
verify whether submitted reports indeed depict road hazards. We found 92% of
user-submitted reports to match the MTurkers judgements. While our prototype
was designed and tested on a specific city, our methodology is applicable to
other developing cities."
"The Third Infoscape refers to the information and knowledge generated through
the myriads of micro-histories, through the progressive, emergent and
polyphonic sedimentation of the expressions of the daily lives of city
dwellers. To all effects, with the development of wireless sensors, of smart
dust1, and with the possibility to engage human beings in urban sensing
processes, the dimension of virtuality collapses. Heading towards a state which
is basically comparable to the one of telepathy (among human beings, human
beings and machines, machines and machines...), reconfiguring urban ecologies
so that mapping virtuality or physicality would not be needed anymore, and
replacing this need with the possibility to create recombinant inventories of
the telepathic migration of dusts, of the myriads of pulverized sensors which
are disseminated, diffused. We can imagine information mutating into landscape,
delineating an urban space which is not determined by distance and time, but
from the transformation of densities and presences."
"While teaching introductory programming courses for over a decade in reputed
institutions we have experienced that several factors play significant role in
developing problem solving skills and program development skills in students.
There are certain types of difficulties that are encountered by the beginners.
These difficulties vary in their nature. Beginners find difficulties with the
programming language that they use, the compilers that they use and so on.
These difficulties if not overcome proves detrimental to their career as
professional engineers at a later stage. This paper focuses on the various
types of difficulties that a novice programmer faces while learning programming
and tries to find out ways to overcome them."
"Although the basic application of Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) in the Tanzanian health care systems started years ago, still
fragmentation of Information Systems (IS) and limited interoperability remain
to be big challenges. In this paper, we present an analysis done on the present
health care delivery service, HIS and on some of existing eHealth solutions
focusing on interoperability and collaboration. Through interviews,
questionnaires and analysis on e-health implementations in relation to
interoperability and collaboration we have established that, the lack of
standard procedures to guide the lifecycle of eHealth systems across the health
sector and poor willingness to collaboration among health stakeholders are key
issues which hinders the manifestation of the benefit of ICT use in the health
sector of Tanzania. Based on the findings, we provide some recommendations with
a view to improve interoperability and collaboration."
"Although ICT have created hope for a shared pluralistic world, democratic
principles are far from being respected in the public digital environment, and
require a detailed knowledge of the laws by which they are governed. Von
Foerster's conjecture is one of the early theoretical results that could help
to understand these laws. Although neglected since a long time, the advent of
the overlying layer of recommendation and ranking mechanisms which is
progressively occupying the Web has given empirical evidences of this
conjecture, which predicts the consequences of increasing inter-individual
influences on social dynamics and the susceptibility of these latter to
manipulation. With both von Foerster's conjecture and the Snowden revelations
in the background, we analyse the impact of ICT on human societies and their
governance, in view of the fact that they have a massive impact on the way in
which people influence each other in their tastes and actions."
"An increasingly aging population and spiraling healthcare costs have made the
search for financially viable healthcare models an imperative of this century.
The careful and creative application of information technology can play a
significant role in meeting that challenge. Valuable lessons can be learned
from an analysis of ten innovative telemedicine and e-health initiatives.
Having proven their effectiveness in addressing a variety of medical needs,
they have progressed beyond small-scale implementations to become an
established part of healthcare delivery systems around the world."
"In addition to visiting high profile sites such as Facebook and Google, web
users often visit more modest sites, such as those operated by bloggers, or by
local organizations such as schools. Such sites, which we call ""Just Plain
Sites"" (JPSs) are likely to inadvertently represent greater privacy risks than
high profile sites by virtue of being unable to afford privacy expertise. To
assess the prevalence of the privacy risks to which JPSs may inadvertently be
exposing their visitors, we analyzed a number of easily observed privacy
practices of such sites. We found that many JPSs collect a great deal of
information from their visitors, share a great deal of information about their
visitors with third parties, permit a great deal of tracking of their visitors,
and use deprecated or unsafe security practices. Our goal in this work is not
to scold JPS operators, but to raise awareness of these facts among both JPS
operators and visitors, possibly encouraging the operators of such sites to
take greater care in their implementations, and visitors to take greater care
in how, when, and what they share."
"Approximately ten percent of newborns require some help with their breathing
at birth. About one percent require extensive assistance at birth which needs
to be administered by trained personnel. Neonatal resuscitation is taught
through a simulation based training program in North America. Such a training
methodology is cost and resource intensive which reduces its availability
thereby adversely impacting skill acquisition and retention. We implement and
present RETAIN (REsuscitation TrAIning for Neonatal residents) -- a video game
to complement the existing neonatal training. Being a video game, RETAIN runs
on ubiquitous off-the-shelf hardware and can be easily accessed by trainees
almost anywhere at their convenience. Thus we expect RETAIN to help trainees
retain and retrain their resuscitation skills. We also report on how RETAIN was
developed by an interdisciplinary team of six undergraduate students as a
three-month term project for a second year university course."
"Information Technology applications are growing significantly fast for the
past decade. Many Business organizations with emphasize on IT applications are
trying to gain competitive advantages. Empirical studies also demonstrate that
IT increases competitive advantage when it acts with human resources. In this
paper we analyzed and review how various IT applications can be utilized to to
provide a company with strategic advantages over the global marketplace
competitive forces."
"Advent of the Internet-of-Things will allow us to optimize equipment and
resource usage, enabling increased efficiencies in automation and enabling new
and more cost efficient business model. As tremendous growth opportunities
emerge, so do the challenges such as diverse devices spanning across multiple
networks, the need to manage the exponential growth of sensor generated data
and to make sense of the huge influx of data in meaningful ways. The multitude
of diversity can best be addressed by fundamentally opening up systems,
architecture and applications. To go the next step and truly exploit the value
of the sensor data would further require real-time analytics to gain
intelligence and respond to events as they happen. Historical analysis can be
used to look for trends, analyze collections of sensor data for correlation and
formulate hints and suggestions based on usage and patterns. In this paper, we
present a framework that overcomes diversity through its ability to flexibly
represent sensor data on the internet. Business goals-driven information
processing, information derived intelligence and information control as
elements of the framework can further enable creation of new and innovative
applications that enhance and exploit the value of Internet-of-Things."
"Despite having a number of benefits for healthcare settings, the successful
implementation of health information systems (HIS) continues to be a challenge
in many developing countries. This paper examines the current state of health
information systems in government hospitals in Fiji. It also investigates if
the general public as well as medical practitioners in Fiji have interest in
having web based electronic medical records systems that allow patients to
access their reports and make online bookings for their appointments. Nausori
Health Centre was used as a case study to examine the information systems in a
government hospital in Fiji."
"Researchers look for new virtual instruments that can improve and maximize
traditional forms of teaching and learning. In this paper, we present the ARG
system, a virtual tool developed to help the teaching/learning process in
argumentation theory, especially in the field of Law. ARG was developed based
on Araucaria by Reed and Rowe, Room 5 by Ronald P. Loui, as well on systems
such as Argue!-System and ArguMed by Bart Verheij. ARG is a platform for online
collaboration and applies the theory of Stephen Toulmin to produce arguments
that are more concise, precise, minimally structured and more resistant to
criticism."
"This paper focuses on services and applications provided to mobile users
using airborne computing infrastructure. We present concepts such as
drones-as-a-service and fly-in,fly-out infrastructure, and note data management
and system design issues that arise in these scenarios. Issues of Big Data
arising from such applications, optimising the configuration of airborne and
ground infrastructure to provide the best QoS and QoE, situation-awareness,
scalability, reliability, scheduling for efficiency, interaction with users and
drones using physical annotations are outlined."
"This is a short position paper drawing on experience working with the UK
banking industry and their disabled and ageing customers in the Business
Disability Forum, a UK non-profit member organisation funded by a large body of
UK private and public sector businesses. We describe some commonly reported
problems of disabled customers who use modern banking technologies, relating
them to UK law and best practice. We describe some of the recent banking
industry innovations and the hope they may offer for improved inclusive and
accessible multi-channel banking."
"A variety of Transparency-Enhancing Technologies has been presented during
the past years. However, investigation of frameworks for classification and
assessment of Transparency-Enhancing Technologies has lacked behind. The lack
of precise classification and categorization approaches poses an obstacle not
only to systematic requirements analysis for Transparency-Enhancing
Technologies but also to investigation and analysis of their capabilities and
their suitability to contribute to privacy protection. This paper addresses
this research gap. In particular, it presents a set of categorization
parameters for describing the properties and functionality of a
Transparency-Enhancing Technology on the one hand, and a categorization of
Transparency-Enhancing Technologies on the other hand."
"Over the years several studies have demonstrated the ability to identify
potential drug-drug interactions via data mining from the literature (MEDLINE),
electronic health records, public databases (Drugbank), etc. While each one of
these approaches is properly statistically validated, they do not take into
consideration the overlap between them as one of their decision making
variables. In this paper we present LInked Drug-Drug Interactions (LIDDI), a
public nanopublication-based RDF dataset with trusty URIs that encompasses some
of the most cited prediction methods and sources to provide researchers a
resource for leveraging the work of others into their prediction methods. As
one of the main issues to overcome the usage of external resources is their
mappings between drug names and identifiers used, we also provide the set of
mappings we curated to be able to compare the multiple sources we aggregate in
our dataset."
"Mobile learning (mLearning) is the cutting-edge learning platform to really
gain traction, driven mostly by the huge uptake in smartphones and their ever
increasing uses within the educational society. Education has long benefitted
from the proliferation of technology; however, mLearning adoption has not
proceeded at the pace one might expect. There is a disconnect between the rate
of adoption of the underlying platform (smartphones) and the use of that
technology within learning. The reasons behind this have been the subject of
several research studies. However, previous studies have mostly focused on
investigating the critical success factors (CSFs) from the student
perspectives. In this research, we have carried out an extensive study of the
six factors that impact the success of mLearning from instructors perspectives.
The results of the research showed that three factors: technical competence of
instructors, Instructors autonomy, and blended learning are the most important
elements that contribute to mLearning adoption from instructors perspectives."
"The population of elderly people keeps increasing rapidly, which becomes a
predominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and
cost-effective need to be sought. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a new
approach which promises to address the needs from elderly people. Ambient
Intelligence technologies are widely developed in this domain aiming to
construct safe environments around assisted peoples and help them maintain
independent living. However, there are still many fundamental issues in AAL
that remain open. Most of the current efforts still do not fully express the
power of human being, and the importance of social connections and social
activities is less noticed. Our conjecture is that such features are
fundamental prerequisites towards truly effective AAL services. This paper
reviews the current status of researches on AAL, discusses the promises and
possible advantages of AAL, and also indicates the challenges we must meet in
order to develop practical and efficient AAL systems for elderly people. In
this paper, we also propose an approach to construct effective home-care system
for the elderly people."
"The Web 2.0 has permeated academic life. The use of online information
services in post-secondary education has led to dramatic changes in faculty
teaching methods as well as in the learning and study behavior of students. At
the same time, traditional information media, such as textbooks and printed
handouts, still form the basic pillars of teaching and learning. This paper
reports the results of a survey about media usage in teaching and learning
conducted with Western University students and instructors, highlighting trends
in the usage of new and traditional media in higher education by instructors
and students. In addition, the survey comprises part of an international
research program in which 20 universities from 10 countries are currently
participating. Further, the study will hopefully become a part of the ongoing
discussion of practices and policies that purport to advance the effective use
of media in teaching and learning."
"Location-sharing services were built upon people's desire to share their
activities and locations with others. By ""checking-in"" to a place, such as a
restaurant, a park, gym, or train station, people disclose where they are,
thereby providing valuable information about land use and utilization of
services in urban areas. This information may, in turn, be used to design
smarter, happier, more equitable cities. We use data from Foursquare
location-sharing service to identify areas within a major US metropolitan area
with many check-ins, i.e., areas that people like to use. We then use data from
the Twitter microblogging platform to analyze the properties of these areas.
Specifically, we have extracted a large corpus of geo-tagged messages, called
tweets, from a major metropolitan area and linked them US Census data through
their locations. This allows us to measure the sentiment expressed in tweets
that are posted from a specific area, and also use that area's demographic
properties in analysis. Our results reveal that areas with many check-ins are
different from other areas within the metropolitan region. In particular, these
areas have happier tweets, which also encourage people from other areas to
commute longer distances to these places. These findings shed light on human
mobility patterns, as well as how physical environment influences human
emotions."
"We surveyed 237 undergraduate students who are enrolled in various subjects
and are members of software engineering teams. Their being a member in a team
is part of the requirements of the course. We found that each of task
visibility, distributive justice, and intrinsic task involvement were
negatively associated with social loafing. We also found out that dominance,
aggression and sucker effect each were positively correlated with social
loafing. We further found out that perception of social loafing exists among
members of software engineering teams."
"In this era of computers and communication technology where computers and
internet have made their ways to every sphere of life from offices to
residences, reservation counters to banks to post offices, small retail shops
to big organizations, health care units to entertainment industries etc., there
emerged numerous questions regarding the ethical and legal uses of Information
and Communication Technology (ICT). Like any other technological inventions ICT
too has created both positive and negative impacts on the society. This paper
aims at exploring some of these issues in brief."
"As we move towards more data intensive, device centric global communication
networks, our ability to usefully harvest these large datastores is degrading.
The widening asymmetry in the explosive growth of data versus our ability to
use it, is forcing us towards centralized analytics. This splintered
concentration of data further consolidates analytical capabilities in the hands
of the few and divides the network into the analysors and the analysed. The
fracturing of the system into opaque datastores and analytics blocks creates a
strong positive feedback loop and has a significant negative impact on the
stability, transparency and freedom of the network. This paper attempted to
identify problems associated with the internet, internet dependent business
models and reviewing available solutions and discuss possible solutions which
became necessary."
"In recent century, with developing of equipment, using of the internet and
things connected to the internet is growing. Therefore, the need for informing
in the process of expanding the scope of its application is very necessary and
important. These days, using intelligent and autonomous devices in our daily
lives has become commonplace and the Internet is the most important part of the
relationship between these tools and even at close distances also. Things
connected to the Internet that are currently in use and can be inclusive of all
the sciences as a step to develop and coordinate of them. In this paper we
investigate application and using of Internet of things from the perspective of
various sciences. We show that how this phenomenon can influence on future
health of people."
"While substantial effort has been devoted to understand fraudulent activity
in traditional online advertising (search and banner), more recent forms such
as video ads have received little attention. The understanding and
identification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for
advertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection
mechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development
of independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems
are missing today and needed by both industry and regulators.
  In this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. Using
our tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major
online video portals. Our results reveal that YouTube's detection system
significantly outperforms all the others. Despite this, a systematic evaluation
indicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. Furthermore, we
find that YouTube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters
differently, the former being more aggressive. This means that views identified
as fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. We
speculate that even though YouTube's policy puts in lots of effort to
compensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden
of the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed."
"Digital maps have become a part of our daily life with a number of commercial
and free map services. These services have still a huge potential for
enhancement with rich semantic information to support a large class of mapping
applications. In this paper, we present Map++, a system that leverages standard
cell-phone sensors in a crowdsensing approach to automatically enrich digital
maps with different road semantics like tunnels, bumps, bridges, footbridges,
crosswalks, road capacity, among others. Our analysis shows that cell-phones
sensors with humans in vehicles or walking get affected by the different road
features, which can be mined to extend the features of both free and commercial
mapping services. We present the design and implementation of Map++ and
evaluate it in a large city. Our evaluation shows that we can detect the
different semantics accurately with at most 3% false positive rate and 6% false
negative rate for both vehicle and pedestrian-based features. Moreover, we show
that Map++ has a small energy footprint on the cell-phones, highlighting its
promise as a ubiquitous digital maps enriching service."
"Recent developments in the use of technologies in education have provided
unique opportunities for teaching and learning. This paper describes the
results of a survey conducted at Western University (Canada) in 2013, regarding
the use of media by students and instructors. The results of this study support
the assumption that the media usage of students and instructors include a
mixture of traditional and new media. The main traditional media continue to be
important, and some new media have emerged as seemingly on equal footing or
even more important than the traditional forms of media. Some new media that
have recently been in the public spotlight do not seem to be as important as
expected. These new media may still be emerging but it is not possible to know
their ultimate importance at this point. There was some variation in media
usage across different Faculties but perhaps not as much variation as might
have been expected."
"The pervasiveness of online information services has led to substantial
changes in higher education including changes in faculty members teaching
methods and students study habits. This article presents the results of a
survey about media use for teaching and learning conducted at a large Canadian
university and highlights trends in the use of new and traditional media across
university Faculties. The results of this study support the assumption that
student media usage includes a mixture of traditional and new media."
"This paper provides an interdisciplinary perspective concerning the role of
prosumers on future Internet design based on the current trend of Internet user
empowerment. The paper debates the prosumer role, and addresses models to
develop a symmetric Internet architecture and supply-chain based on the
integration of social capital aspects. It has as goal to ignite the discussion
concerning a socially-driven Internet architectural design."
"The Facebook has become an essential part of almost every university students
daily life."
"We witnessed the low quality of IT solutions in Paris hospitals. The price
paid to private companies for these solutions and the cost incurred from their
inefficiency constitute a gross and appalling waste of public resources. We
propose to bootstrap a change in IT policy by having heads of department hire
IT workers ; we give advice to the central decision making body on how to
incentivize them. Easily measurable efficiency gains as well as
hard-to-quantify positive externalities will follow."
"The information era is the time when information is not only largely
generated, but also vastly processed in order to extract and generated more
information. The complex nature of modern living is represented by the various
kind of data. Data can be in the forms of signals, images, texts, or manifolds
resembling the horizon of observation. The task of the emerging data sciences
are to extract information from the data, for people gain new insights of the
complex world. The insights may came from the new way of the data
representation, be it a visualizations, mapping, or other. The insights may
also come from the implementation of mathematical analysis and or computational
processing giving new insights of what the states of the nature represented by
the data. Both ways implement the methodologies reducing the dimensionality of
the data. The relations between the two functions, representation and analysis
are the heart of how information in data is transformed mathematically and
computationally into new information. The paper discusses some practices, along
with various data coming from the social life in Indonesia to gain new insights
about Indonesia in the emerging data sciences. The data sciences in Indonesia
has made Indonesian Data Cartograms, Indonesian Celebrity Sentiment Mapping,
Ethno-Clustering Maps, social media community detection, and a lot more to
come, become possible. All of these are depicted as the exemplifications on how
Data Science has become integral part of the technology bringing data closer to
people."
"The paper reports the possibility of Indonesian traditional artisans of
weaving designs and crafts to explore the cellular automata, a dynamical model
in computation that may yield similar patterns. The reviews of the cellular
automata due to the perspective of weaving process reveals that the latter
would focus on macro-properties, i.e.: the strength of structural construction
beside the aesthetic patterns and designs. The meeting of traditional weaving
practice and the computational model is delivered and open the door for
interesting discourse of computer-aided designs for the traditional artists and
designers to come."
"The herein approach addresses the case when the user is part of the
communication channel. A purpose of the abstraction is to provide a framework
for the field of communications, with the user included in the system,
reckoning the current 7 Layer model allows safeguards for data only. Solid
grounds for application were identified as contribution to ensuring the need
for safety which becomes tight during emergency events where timely evacuation
is critical. One of the components of a communication system [1] as described
in information theory, is the communication channel. It allows the transmitter
signal representing the message, to reach the receiver. A hardware setup with
two different communication systems in a user-in-the-loop (UIL) [2]
configuration is described and assessed pertinent to the specific application."
"Based on the fact that management of nutrition information is still a problem
in many developing countries including Tanzania and nutrition information is
only verbally provided without emphasis, this study proposes mobile application
for enhancing management of nutrition information. The paper discusses the
implementation of an integrated mobile application for enhancing management of
nutrition information based on literature review and interviews, which were
conducted in Arusha region for the collection of key information and details
required for designing the mobile application. In this application, PHP
technique has been used to build the application logic and MySQL technology for
developing the back-end database. Using XML and Java, we have built an
application interface that provides easy interactive view."
"In this work, we design and develop a smart intruder detection and alert
system which aims to elevate the security as well as the likelihood of true
positive identification of trespassers and intruders as compared to other
commonly deployed electronic security systems. Using multiple sensors, this
system can gauge the extent of danger exhibited by a person or animal in or
around the home premises, and can forward various critical information
regarding the event to home owners as well as other specified entities, such as
relevant security authorities."
"Since the introduction of the Fortran programming language some 60 years ago,
there has been little progress in making error messages more user-friendly. A
first step in this direction is to translate them into the natural language of
the students. In this paper we propose a simple script for Linux systems which
gives word by word translations of error messages. It works for most
programming languages and for all natural languages. Understanding the error
messages generated by compilers is a major hurdle for students who are learning
programming, particularly for non-native English speakers. Not only may they
never become ""fluent"" in programming but many give up programming altogether.
Whereas programming is a tool which can be useful in many human activities,
e.g. history, genealogy, astronomy, entomology, in many countries the skill of
programming remains confined to a narrow fringe of professional programmers. In
all societies, besides professional violinists there are also amateurs. It
should be the same for programming. It is our hope that once translated and
explained the error messages will be seen by the students as an aid rather than
as an obstacle and that in this way more students will enjoy learning and
practising programming. They should see it as a funny game."
"Singapore, an urbanized and populated country with high penetration of
smartphones, provides an excellent base for citizen-centric participatory
sensing applications. Mobile participatory sensing applications offer an
efficient means of directing feedback to government agencies for timely
identifying and solving problems of citizens' concern. While real deployments
of such applications are on an uprising trend in Singapore, there is no
concerted effort that studies the {\em user experience} of these applications.
To fill this gap, we conduct a market study by analyzing the user reviews on
the Google Play and Apple App Store for six major mobile crowdsourcing
applications created by Singapore government agencies. This study was carried
out for a period of 4 months during which we collected and analyzed 592
customer reviews. This was also supplemented by our personal use of the
applications during the same period.
  This paper presents the methodology and findings of this study, as well as
our recommendations of what improvements that these applications could
incorporate. We classify user reviews into 8 major concerns, and recommend 9
features to enhance the applications' utility. The recommendations are
presented in terms of user interface, incentive, and publicity."
"Indonesian traditional villagers have a tradition for the sake of their own
social and economic security named 'nyumbang'. There are wide variations of the
traditions across the archipelago, and we revisit an observation to one in
Subang, West Java, Indonesia. The paper discusses and employs the evolutionary
game theoretic insights to see the process of 'gantangan', of the intertwining
social cohesion and economic expectation of the participation within the
traditional activities. The current development of the gantangan tradition is
approached and generalized to propose a view between the economic and social
sphere surrounding modern people. While some explanations due to the current
development of gantangan is drawn, some aspects related to traditional views
complying the modern life with social and economic expectations is outlined."
"We propose and implement a novel relative positioning system, WalkieLokie, to
enable more kinds of Augmented Reality applications, e.g., virtual shopping
guide, virtual business card sharing. WalkieLokie calculates the distance and
direction between an inquiring user and the corresponding target. It only
requires a dummy speaker binding to the target and broadcasting inaudible
acoustic signals. Then the user walking around can obtain the position using a
smart device. The key insight is that when a user walks, the distance between
the smart device and the speaker changes; and the pattern of displacement
(variance of distance) corresponds to the relative position. We use a
second-order phase locked loop to track the displacement and further estimate
the position. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of our strategy, we
propose a synchronization mechanism to synthesize all estimation results from
different timeslots. We show that the mean error of ranging and direction
estimation is 0.63m and 2.46 degrees respectively, which is accurate even in
case of virtual business card sharing. Furthermore, in the shopping mall where
the environment is quite severe, we still achieve high accuracy of positioning
one dummy speaker, and the mean position error is 1.28m."
"Information technology is widely used as a media monitor various activities.
In this study, the authors will utilize IT to monitor the Rural Infrastructure
Development Program (PPIP). PPIP is a program of community development at the
village level in the framework of the provision of basic infrastructure in
rural settlements carried out by the Directorate General of Human Settlements
Ministry of Public Works to support the policy of the Indonesian government.
PPIP Kab. Muba through the Department of Public Works and Human Settlement
Irrigation District Muba as actors in the process of distribution of program
development implementation, disbursement, monitoring (monitoring), and
reporting. In the implementation process of the realization of all the
monitoring data is processed in a conventional manner or format of diverse
reports from the field so often goes wrong, the late submission of reports and
inaccuracies among reports received by the condition of the field. The system
can manage employment targets, reporting a physical realization and financial
absorption, process data reporting information on a regular basis, timely,
complete and factual as the data obtained directly from implementing
supervisory officers in the field. This system is built with web-based
information technology using PHP and MySQL database."
"The paper presents a tool for the mapping of the performance of building
systems on European scale for different (future) time periods. The tool is to
use for users and be applicable for different building systems. Users should
also be able to use a broad range of climate parameters to assess the influence
of climate change on these climatic parameters. Also should the calculation
time be reasonable short. The mapping tool is developed in MATLAB, which can be
used by other users for their own studies."
"The usage of mobile phones is nearly 3.5 times more than that of personal
computers. Android has the largest share among its counter parts like IOS,
Windows and Symbian Android applications have a very few restrictions on them.
TTS systems on Android are available for many languages but a very few systems
of this type are available for Punjabi language. Our research work had the aim
to develop an application that will be able to produce synthetic Punjabi
speech. The paper examines the methodology used to develop speech synthesis TTS
system for the Punjabi content, which is written in Gurmukhi script. For the
development of this system, we use concatenative speech synthesis method with
phonemes as the basic units of concatenation. Some challenges like application
size, processing time, must be considered, while porting this TTS system to
resource-limited devices like mobile phones."
"Existing studies have extensively used temporal-spatial data to mining the
mobility patterns of different kinds of travelers. Smart Card Data (SCD)
collected by the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems can reflect a general
view of the mobility pattern of the whole bus and metro riders in urban area.
Since the mobility and stability are temporally and spatially dynamic and
therefore difficult to measure, few work focuses on the transition of their
travel pattern between a long time interval. In this paper, an overview of the
relation between stability and regularity of public transit riders based on SCD
of Beijing is presented first. To analyze the temporal travel pattern of urban
residents, travelers are classified into two categories, extreme and
non-extreme travelers. We have two lines for profiling all cardholders,
rule-based approach for extreme and improved density-based clustering method
for non-extreme. Similar clusters are aggregated according their features of
regularity and occasionality. By combining transition matrix of passenger's
temporal travel pattern and socioeconomic data of Beijing in the year of 2010
and 2014, several analyses about resident's temporal mobility and stability are
presented to shed lights on the interdependence between stability and mobility
in the time dimension. The results indicate that passengers's regularity is
hard to predict, extreme travel patterns are more vulnerable and overall
non-extreme travel patterns nearly stay the same."
"Are purely technological solutions the best answer we can get to the
shortcomings our organizations are often experiencing today? The results we
gathered in this work lead us to giving a negative answer to such question.
Science and technology are powerful boosters, though when they are applied to
the ""local, static organization of an obsolete yesterday"" they fail to
translate in the solutions we need to our problems. Our stance here is that
those boosters should be applied to novel, distributed, and dynamic models able
to allow us to escape from the local minima our societies are currently locked
in. One such model is simulated in this paper to demonstrate how it may be
possible to tap into the vast basins of social energy of our human societies to
realize ubiquitous computing sociotechnical services for the identification and
timely response to falls."
"Information technology (IT) is able to fulfill one of the main needs of an
organization, such as how the executive know and manage the performance of the
organization he leads, including the human resources (HR). Faculty of
Agriculture, University of Muhammadiyah Palembang (UMP) has had personnel
information system which is used to manage HR data both employees and
lecturers. However, the information system is to support the operational
activities only. Therefore it is necessary to build an executive information
system (SIE) in the faculty is the dean. By using the SIE, the dean can easily
access summary data visualization, namely the appearance of information in the
form of graphs making it easier for executives to make decisions."
"The paper considers the level of the extremely low-frequency magnetic field,
which is produced by laptop computers. The magnetic field, which is
characterized by extremely low frequencies up to 300 Hz is measured due to its
hazardous effects to the laptop user's health. The experiment consists of
testing 13 different laptop computers in normal operation conditions. The
measuring of the magnetic field is performed in the adjacent neighborhood of
the laptop computers. The measured data are presented and then classified. The
classification is performed by the K-Medians method in order to determine the
critical positions of the laptop. At the end, the measured magnetic field
values are compared with the critical values suggested by different safety
standards. It is shown that some of the laptop computers emit a very strong
magnetic field. Hence, they must be used with extreme caution."
"Wireless roaming is one way to improve the reliability of a network of
hotspots that are still using the topology Basic Service Set (BSS). When the
user walks away from one access point (AP) or one AP die then begins to lose
the signal, the mobile station (MS) is automatically connected with the AP to
another without reconfiguring. Devices that support wireless roaming is the AP
TP-Link TL-WR740N using DD-WRT firmware that supports DHCP forwarder. Wireless
roaming makes it easy for the user if there is more than one AP in an area."
"Uber has recently been introducing novel practices in urban taxi transport.
Journey prices can change dynamically in almost real time and also vary
geographically from one area to another in a city, a strategy known as surge
pricing. In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open
datasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies
that emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more
transparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price
comparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover
that Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher
fares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in
occurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone
application, OpenStreetCab, that offers a personalized consultation to mobile
users on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months
after its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a
single city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the
potential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a
highlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per
taxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive
experiments to show how Uber's surge pricing is the driving factor of higher
journey prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application's
users. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber's surge pricing is
occurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction
task where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area's tendency to surge.
Using exogenous to Uber datasets we show how it is possible to estimate
customer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high
accuracy."
"Medical training devices are becoming increasingly dependent on technology,
creating opportunities that are inherently conducive to security breaches.
Previous medical device research has focused on individual device security
breaches and the technical aspects involved with these breaches. This research
examines the viability of breaching a production-deployed medical training
mannequin. The results of the proof of concept research indicate that it is
possible to breach a medical training mannequin in a live environment. The
research contribution is an initial empirical analysis of the viability of
compromising a medical training mannequin along with providing the foundation
for future research."
"This paper presents DiffSum, a simple post-election risk-limiting
ballot-polling audit for two-candidate plurality elections. DiffSum
sequentially draws ballots (without replacement) until the numbers $a$, $b$, of
votes for candidates $A$, $B$ satisfies $a>b$ and $(a-b)^2 > c(a+b)$, where $A$
is the reported winner and $c$ is a suitably chosen constant. Bounds on the
error rate (chance of approving an incorrect election outcome) are obtained via
simulations. The method is compared with the Bravo method of Lindeman, Stark,
and Yates."
"The recent interest in Big Data has generated a broad range of new academic,
corporate, and policy practices along with an evolving debate amongst its
proponents, detractors, and skeptics. While the practices draw on a common set
of tools, techniques, and technologies, most contributions to the debate come
either from a particular disciplinary perspective or with an eye on a
domain-specific issue. A close examination of these contributions reveals a set
of common problematics that arise in various guises in different places. It
also demonstrates the need for a critical synthesis of the conceptual and
practical dilemmas surrounding Big Data. The purpose of this article is to
provide such a synthesis by drawing on relevant writings in the sciences,
humanities, policy, and trade literature. In bringing these diverse literatures
together, we aim to shed light on the common underlying issues that concern and
affect all of these areas. By contextualizing the phenomenon of Big Data within
larger socio-economic developments, we also seek to provide a broader
understanding of its drivers, barriers, and challenges. This approach allows us
to identify attributes of Big Data that need to receive more
attention--autonomy, opacity, and generativity, disparity, and
futurity--leading to questions and ideas for moving beyond dilemmas."
"Development of information technology in the field of spatial data processing
has helped many digital mapping. In the present study, the authors will empower
geographic information systems (GIS) for geographic data processing potential
Banyuasin district. The potential of the region are agriculture, farming, and
industry. The method used to develop the GIS is the waterfall approach models.
After conducting a series of activities starting from the analysis,
requirements, system design, coding, testing, then obtained an information
systems that can provide information about the geographical spread of the
potential of web-based Banyuasin district with the help of ArcGIS. This system
was built by using the waterfall model. The result is a GIS that provide
location information potential of the region."
"This study reviews the topic of big data management in the 21st-century.
There are various developments that have facilitated the extensive use of that
form of data in different organizations. The most prominent beneficiaries are
internet businesses and big companies that used vast volumes of data even
before the computational era. The research looks at the definitions of big data
and the factors that influence its access and use for different persons around
the globe. Most people consider the internet as the most significant source of
this data and more specifically on cloud computing and social networking
platforms. It requires sufficient and adequate management procedures to achieve
the efficient use of the big data. The study revisits some of the conventional
methods that companies use to attain this. There are different challenges such
as cost and security that limit the use of big data. Despite these problems,
there are various benefits that everyone can exploit by implementing it, and
they are the focus for most enterprises."
"China has experienced a spectacular economic growth in recent decades. Its
economy grew more than 48 times from 1980 to 2013. How are the other countries
reacting to China's rise? Do they see it as an economic opportunity or a
security threat? In this paper, we answer this question by analyzing online
news reports about China published in Australia, France, Germany, Japan,
Russia, South Korea, the UK and the US. More specifically, we first analyze the
frequency with which China has appeared in news headlines, which is a measure
of China's influence in the world. Second, we build a Naive Bayes classifier to
study the evolving nature of the news reports, i.e., whether they are economic
or political. We then evaluate the friendliness of the news coverage based on
sentiment analysis. Empirical results indicate that there has been increasing
news coverage of China in all the countries under study. We also find that the
emphasis of the reports is generally shifting towards China's economy. Here
Japan and South Korea are exceptions: they are reporting more on Chinese
politics. In terms of global sentiment, the picture is quite gloomy. With the
exception of Australia and, to some extent, France, all the other countries
under examination are becoming less positive towards China."
"Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer-based system used to store
and manipulate geographic information. In this study, GIS is used to obtain
information about ""open green space of urban areas"" (RTHKP). Office of street
lighting and Cemetery Palembang is one agency that regulates the green open
spaces but not using media such as websites that support the community to get
information about the open green space of urban areas in the city of Palembang,
so it was apparent from the author will build a system RTKHP with geographic
information system development methodology Rational Unified Process (RUP), the
programming language PHP and uses a MySQL database. With the GIS open green
space of urban areas that will be made later can help facilitate the public to
get information related to RTHKP and assist the Department of street lighting
and landscaping burial in managing and providing related information RTHKP in
Palembang so that delivery of information to be more effective."
"We describe a method of automatic feedback provision for students learning
programming and computational methods in Python. We have implemented, used and
refined this system since 2009 for growing student numbers, and summarise the
design and experience of using it. The core idea is to use a unit testing
framework: the teacher creates a set of unit tests, and the student code is
tested by running these tests. With our implementation, students typically
submit work for assessment, and receive feedback by email within a few minutes
after submission. The choice of tests and the reporting back to the student is
chosen to optimise the educational value for the students. The system very
significantly reduces the staff time required to establish whether a student's
solution is correct, and shifts the emphasis of computing laboratory student
contact time from assessing correctness to providing guidance. The self-paced
nature of the automatic feedback provision supports a student-centred learning
approach. Students can re-submit their work repeatedly and iteratively improve
their solution, and enjoy using the system. We include an evaluation of the
system and data from using it in a class of 425 students."
"Despite the large investments in the field of e-Government (e-Gov) around the
world, little is known about the impact such investment. This is due to the
lack of guidance evaluation, absence of appropriate tools to measure the impact
of e-Gov on the private sector, as well as the lack of effective management to
resolve or eliminate the barriers to e-Gov services that led to the failure or
delay of many projects. This paper is primarily concerned in determining the
impact of e-Gov services on the private sector. A combination of Modified
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), DeLone and McLean's of IS success will be
utilized as a research model and e-Gov Economics Project (eGEP) framework to
measure (Efficiency, Democracy & Effectiveness impact) for G2B services. The
research result will help e-Gov decision makers to recognize the critical
factors that are responsible for G2B success, specifically factors they need to
pay attention to gain the highest return on their technology investment, hence
enabling them to measure the impact for e-Gov on the private sector. The paper
has also demonstrated the usefulness of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in
analysis of small data sets and in exploratory research."
"STEM has attracted great consideration. The purpose of research is: (1) study
STEM education, (2) explore STEM education with the creative and experiential
activity, (3) suggest applying STEM education by designing technical toys for
the middle school student. This study used a qualitative approach to carry out
teaching integration for STEM education. The study applied to teaching the
technological field in Vietnamese middle schools. The design performed at the
Faculty of Technology Education, Hanoi National University of Education,
Vietnam in April 2015. This study used the integrated approach to design
subjects for STEM education. Two procedures for integration undertook with
analysis. A sample of producing technical toy was consistent with developing
students competencies. Integrated approach to STEM education through designing
technical toys is possible. Recently, there has been a booming interest in
Integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education,
but the approaches to STEM still remains controversial in diverse educational
contexts. This study addressed this issue by exploring STEM education with the
use of creative and experiential activities in a Vietnamese educational
context. It also proposed a practical model for integrating STEM into teaching
technology in secondary schools by designing technical toys. The implementation
of the practical model suggests the possibility in using the integrated
approach to STEM education through designing technical toys for middle school
students in Vietnam. By applying the subject knowledge domains to solve real
world problems and settings, the students can experience the benefits of a
concrete and active learning in a meaningful and practical context. The
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary integration approaches are consistent
with the development of the students competencies."
"(English title) Wikipedia entries on fiction: Under what terms is it possible
to report about non-propositional knowledge gained from reading?
  Given that Wikipedia entries are likely to extert a strong influence on how
literary texts are perceived - due to their preferential ranking in Google -
there is some demand that research dealing with the transfer of knowledge on
literature to the public be more concerned with looking into both the content
that is available for free on the Web and any aspect that may come with writing
about literature for free. This contribution argues from within Wikipedia's
multidisciplinary consensus-driven space in which propositional knowledge is
given priority that it would be essential for entries on fiction to present
non-propositional knowledge as being one of its hallmarks. For this aim, a
special concept is developed that is designed to function as the study's formal
object: ""Erlesnis"" (which in German is a pun that combines ""Erlebnis"" -
adventure experience - and ""lesen"" - reading). It is defined as
non-propositional knowledge that has been acquired in an individual reading
process. Writing about one's own Erlesnis in new ways is being tried out in
four essays, and on de.wikipedia.org an experiment is conducted to find out
what community members think about the idea of including, in entries on
fiction, sections specifically designed to report about what people felt like
when reading a certain text. Finally, a draft typology of Erlesnis-writing is
suggested. This contribution is the first of its kind internationally to deal
with Wikipedia from the point of view of transfer of knowledge on literature to
the public. For the theory of this field of research some new aspects are
offered for debate."
"Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport
planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high
quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure
and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the
right places, such as along 'desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates
the need for tools and methods to help answer the question 'where to build?'.
Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this
question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications
of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive
planning support system which was initially developed to explore and map
cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on
origin-destination data, it models and visualises cycling levels at area,
desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and
for scenario-based 'cycling futures'. Four scenarios are presented, including
'Go Dutch' and 'Ebikes', which explore what would happen if English people
cycled as much as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on
cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the
number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and
carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level
for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of
additional scenarios and its deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the
PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and
raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning."
"The paper describes user behavior as a result of introducing monetization in
the freemium educational online platform. Monetization resulted in alternative
system growth mechanisms causing viral increase in the number of users. System
metrics in terms of the $K$-factor was utilized as an indicator of the system
user base growth. The weekly $K$-factor doubled as a result of monetization
introduction."
"In this era of computerization, education has also revamped itself and is not
limited to old lecture method. The regular quest is on to find out new ways to
make it more effective and efficient for students. Nowadays, lots of data is
collected in educational databases, but it remains unutilized. In order to get
required benefits from such a big data, powerful tools are required. Data
mining is an emerging powerful tool for analysis and prediction. It is
successfully applied in the area of fraud detection, advertising, marketing,
loan assessment and prediction. But, it is in nascent stage in the field of
education. Considerable amount of work is done in this direction, but still
there are many untouched areas. Moreover, there is no unified approach among
these researches. This paper presents a comprehensive survey, a travelogue
(2002-2014) towards educational data mining and its scope in future."
"We surveyed 169 undergraduate students who are enrolled in various courses.
They were members of software engineering groups formed to solve various
real-world computational problems by implementing software projects as part of
the requirements of the course. This time, our analysis show that task
visibility is negatively associated with social loafing while contributions,
dominance, aggression and sucker effect are positively correlated.
  We further found out that perception of social loafing exists and still
persists among members of computer programming groups. Compared to our 2008
analysis, we provide in this paper detailed analysis based on demographic
parameters such as gender, course taken, age group, type of residence (urban or
rural), and region of residence. The implication of this result is that aside
from the usual problems that an instructor faces in teaching software
engineering-related courses, the presence of social loafing also adds to the
impediment of teaching effectiveness. Thus, it is imperative that instructors
and course designers consider the implications associated with social loafing
when designing group projects."
"We have collected and analysed prices for more than 1.4 million flight
tickets involving 63 destinations and 125 airlines and have found that common
sense violation i.e., discrepancies between what consumers would expect and
what truly holds for those prices, are far more frequent than one would think.
For example, oftentimes the price of a single leg flight is higher than two-leg
flights that include it under similar terms of travel (class, luggage
allowance, etc.). This happened for up to 24.5% of available fares on a
specific route in our dataset invalidating the common expectation that ""further
is more expensive"". Likewise, we found several two-leg fares where buying each
leg independently leads to lower overall cost than buying them together as a
single ticket. This happened for up to 37% of available fares on a specific
route invalidating the common expectation that ""bundling saves money"". Last,
several single stop tickets in which the two legs were separated by 1-5 days
(called multicity fares), were oftentimes found to be costing more than
corresponding back-to-back fares with a small transit time. This was found to
be occurring in up to 7.5% fares on a specific route invalidating that ""a short
transit is better than a longer one""."
"Cloud Computing services are increasingly being made available by the UK
Government through the Government digital marketplace to reduce costs and
improve IT efficiency; however, little is known about factors influencing the
decision-making process to adopt cloud services within the UK Government. This
research aims to develop a theoretical framework to understand risk perception
and risk acceptance of cloud computing services. Study subjects (N=24) were
recruited from three UK Government organizations to attend a semi- structured
interview. Transcribed texts were analyzed using the approach termed
interpretive phenomenological analysis. Results showed that the most important
factors influencing risk acceptance of cloud services are: perceived benefits
and opportunities, organization risk culture and perceived risks. We focused on
perceived risks and perceived security concerns. Based on these results, we
suggest a number of implications for risk managers, policy makers and cloud
service providers."
"Cloud computing is revolutionising the way software services are procured and
used by Government organizations and SMEs. Quantitative risk assessment of
Cloud services is complex and undermined by specific security concerns
regarding data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This study explores
how the gap between the quantitative risk assessment and the perception of the
risk can produce a bias in the decision-making process about Cloud computing
adoption. The risk perception of experts in Cloud computing (N=37) and
laypeople (N=81) about ten Cloud computing services was investigated using the
psychometric paradigm. Results suggest that the risk perception of Cloud
services can be represented by two components, called dread risk and unknown
risk, which may explain up to 46% of the variance. Other factors influencing
the risk perception were perceived benefits, trust in regulatory authorities
and technology attitude. This study suggests some implications that could
support Government and non-Government organizations in their strategies for
Cloud computing adoption."
"The feasibility of using microcontrollers in real life applications is
becoming more widespread. These applications have grown from do-it-yourself
(DIY) projects of computer enthusiasts or robotics projects to larger scale
efforts and deployments. This project developed and deployed a prototype
application that allows the public to interact with features of a model and
view videos from a first-person perspective on the train. Through testing the
microcontrollers and their usage in a public setting, it was demonstrated that
interactive features could be implemented in model train exhibits, which are
featured in traditional museum environments that lack technical infrastructure.
Specifically, the Arduino and Raspberry Pi provide the necessary linkages
between the Internet and hardware, allowing for a greater interactive
experience for museum visitors. These results provide an important use-case
scenario that cultural heritage institutions can utilize when implementing
microcontrollers on a larger scale, for the purpose of increasing visitors
experience through greater interaction and engagement."
"Even though it is unrealistic to expect citizens to pinpoint the policy
implementation that they prefer from the set of alternatives, it is still
possible to infer such information through an exercise of ranking the
importance of policy objectives according to their opinion. Assuming that the
mapping between policy options and objective evaluations is a priori known
(through models and simulations), this can be achieved either implicitly
through appropriate analysis of social media content related to the policy
objective in question or explicitly through the direct feedback provided in the
frame of a game. This document focuses on the presentation of a policy model,
which reduces the policy to a multi-objective optimization problem and
mitigates the shortcoming of the lack of social objective functions (public
opinion models) with a black-box, games-for-crowds approach."
"Increased use of social media by police to connect with citizens has
encouraged researchers to study different aspects of information exchange (e.g.
type of information, credibility and propagation) during emergency and crisis
situation. Research studies lack understanding of human behavior such as
engagement, emotions and social interaction between citizen and police
department on social media. Several social media studies explore and show
technological implications of human behavioral aspects in various contexts such
as workplace interaction and depression in young mothers. In this paper, we
study online interactions between citizens and Indian police in context of
day-to-day policing, including safety concerns, advisories, etc. Indian police
departments use Facebook to issue advisories, send alerts and receive citizen
complaints and suggestions regarding safety issues and day-to-day policing. We
explore how citizens express their emotions and social support on Facebook. Our
work discusses technological implications of behavioral aspects on social well
being of citizens."
"As the last years have shown a massive growth within the field of electronic
sports (eSports), several questions emerge, such as how much is it growing, and
will it continue to grow? This research thesis sees this as its statement of
problem, and further aims to define and measure the main factors that caused
the growth of eSports. To further enhance the growth, the benefits and
disbenefits of implementing Information Technology Management tools is
appraised, which additionally gives an understanding of the future of eSports.
  Through observation of the data collection, the themes games played, games
genre, and single-player or team-player was deemed most important. A
statistical analysis was additionally done on the numerical data, which showed
significant correlation between the themes prize pool, participants and
participating countries towards live audience. This indicates that the
mentioned themes affect how many people attends live eSport event. The analysis
also consists of a trend analysis, which presents that nearly every theme
analysed will continue to grow in a five-year period. The trend analysis
further expects a 305.51% growth in the live audience from 2014-2019, while the
virtual streaming audience is expected to experience a growth of 140.61%. To
enhance this growth, the research thesis recommends using the presented trends
and patterns found in the short-term, to conduct successful eSport events.
However, in the long-term an implementation of a Data-driven Decision Support
System can be done, which will periodically gather data to know the best
possible way to deliver eSport events to the eSport community."
"Cloud services today are increasingly built using functionality from other
running services. In this paper, we question whether legacy Quality of Services
(QoS) metrics and enforcement techniques are sufficient as they are producer
centric. We argue that, similar to customer rating systems found in banking
systems and many sharing economy apps (e.g., Uber and Airbnb), Quality of
Consumption (QoC) should be introduced to capture different metrics about
service consumers. We show how the combination of QoS and QoC, dubbed QoX, can
be used by consumers and providers to improve the security and management of
their infrastructure. In addition, we demonstrate how sharing information among
other consumers and providers increase the value of QoX. To address the main
challenge with sharing information, namely sybil attacks and mis-information,
we describe how we can leverage cloud providers as vouching authorities to
ensure the integrity of information. We present initial results in prototyping
the appropriate abstractions and interfaces in a cloud environment, focusing on
the design impact on both service providers and consumers."
"This work presents a smart trespasser detection and alert system which aims
to increase the amount of security as well as the likelihood of positively
identifying or stopping trespassers and intruders as compared to other commonly
deployed home security system. Using multiple sensors, this system can gauge
the extent of danger exhibited by a person or animal in or around the home
premises, and can forward certain critical information regarding the same to
home owners as well as other specified persons such as relevant security
authorities."
"Background: The Virtual Rehabilitation Environment (VRE) provides patients of
long term neurological conditions with a platform to review their previous
physiotherapy sessions, as well as see their goals and any treatments or
exercises that their clinician has set for them to practice before their next
session.
  Objective: The initial application implemented 21 of the 27 core features
using the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC stack. However, the two core, non-functional
requirements were negated from the project due to lack of experience and strict
time constraints. This project aimed to investigate whether the application
would be more suited to a non-relational solution.
  Method: The application was re-written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB,
ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), an open source, fully JavaScript stack and then
performance tests were carried out to compare the two applications. A
scalability review was also conducted to assess the benefits and drawbacks of
each technology in this aspect.
  Results: The investigation proved that the non-relational solution was much
more efficient and performed faster. However, the choice of database was only a
small part of the increase in efficiency and it was an all-round better design
that gave the new application its performance upper hand.
  Conclusion: A proposal for a new application design is given that follows the
microservice architecture used by companies such as Amazon and Netflix. The
application is to be split up into four parts; database, client application,
server application and content delivery network. These four, independently
scalable and manageable services offer the greatest flexibility for future
development at the low costs necessary for a start-up."
"The challenge of this paper is to underline the capability of an Event-Cloud
Platform to support efficiently an emergency situation. We chose to focus on a
nuclear crisis use case. The proposed approach consists in modeling the
business processes of crisis response on the one hand, and in supporting the
orchestration and execution of these processes by using an Event-Cloud Platform
on the other hand. This paper shows how the use of Event-Cloud techniques can
support crisis management stakeholders by automatizing non-value added tasks
and by directing decision- makers on what really requires their capabilities of
choice. If Event-Cloud technology is a very interesting and topical subject,
very few research works have considered this to improve emergency management.
This paper tries to fill this gap by considering and applying these
technologies on a nuclear crisis use-case."
"The Born In Bradford mobile application is an Android mobile application and

"In a world where traditional notions of privacy are increasingly challenged
by the myriad companies that collect and analyze our data, it is important that
decision-making entities are held accountable for unfair treatments arising
from irresponsible data usage. Unfortunately, a lack of appropriate
methodologies and tools means that even identifying unfair or discriminatory
effects can be a challenge in practice. We introduce the unwarranted
associations (UA) framework, a principled methodology for the discovery of
unfair, discriminatory, or offensive user treatment in data-driven
applications. The UA framework unifies and rationalizes a number of prior
attempts at formalizing algorithmic fairness. It uniquely combines multiple
investigative primitives and fairness metrics with broad applicability,
granular exploration of unfair treatment in user subgroups, and incorporation
of natural notions of utility that may account for observed disparities. We
instantiate the UA framework in FairTest, the first comprehensive tool that
helps developers check data-driven applications for unfair user treatment. It
enables scalable and statistically rigorous investigation of associations
between application outcomes (such as prices or premiums) and sensitive user
attributes (such as race or gender). Furthermore, FairTest provides debugging
capabilities that let programmers rule out potential confounders for observed
unfair effects. We report on use of FairTest to investigate and in some cases
address disparate impact, offensive labeling, and uneven rates of algorithmic
error in four data-driven applications. As examples, our results reveal subtle
biases against older populations in the distribution of error in a predictive
health application and offensive racial labeling in an image tagger."
"Learning and teaching experiment was designed to incorporate SRS Student
Response System to measure and assess student engagement in higher education
for level 5 engineering students. The SRS system was based on getting an
immediate student feedback to short quizzes lasting 10 to 15 minutes using
Socrative software. The structure of the questions was a blend of true or
false, multiple choice and short answer questions. The experiment was conducted
through semester 2 of yearlong engineering module. The outcome of the
experiment was analyzed quantitatively based on student performance and
qualitatively through student questionnaire. The results indicate that using
student paced assessments method using Socrative enhanced students performance.
The results showed that 53% of the students improved their performance while
23% neither improved nor underperformed. Qualitative data showed students felt
improvement in their learning experience. Overall results indicate positive
impact using this technology in teaching and learning for engineering modules
in higher education"
"Internet of Thing (IoT) is looking over to overhaul the business processes of

"Nowadays, mobile devices have become increasingly a part of education for
those who study or teach at the university level and school levels. The support
of electronic learning (elearning) is essential to making mobile learning
(m-learning) successful. This paper presents a study that applies mlearning to
a course at Qassim University, where 100 students attended during the academic
year 2014, including summer courses. The study aims to demonstrate that
m-learning provides students with the ability to engage in reflective thinking,
to share information among peers and to facilitate the construction of social
knowledge. 90 student questionnaires were filled correctly, remaining 10 had
various anomalies and thus were not considered. The study also aims to
demonstrate that learning provides methods for education strategies to be
easily and rapidly applied. Such strategies include team work, time management,
etc. In order to judge the feasibility of applying m-learning widely, a
questionnaire was developed. The results indicate that m-learning helps make
the process of education more convenient than in the past. A major disadvantage
of applying m-learning is inadequate wireless network bandwidth."
"The gerrymandering problem is a worldwide problem which sets great threat to
democracy and justice in district based elections. Thanks to partisan
redistricting commissions, district boundaries are often manipulated to benefit
incumbents. Since an independent commission is hard to come by, the possibility
of impartially generating districts with a computer is explored in this thesis.
We have developed an algorithm to randomly produce legal redistricting schemes
for Pennsylvania."
"An item of your personal information is inversely private if some party has
access to it but you do not. We analyze the provenance of inversely private
information and its rise to dominance over other kinds of personal information.
In a nutshell, the inverse privacy problem is unjustified inaccessibility to
you of your inversely private information. We argue that the inverse privacy
problem has a market-based solution."
"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) should reduce traffic accidents, but they will
sometimes have to choose between two evils-for example, running over
pedestrians or sacrificing itself and its passenger to save them. Defining the
algorithms that will help AVs make these moral decisions is a formidable
challenge. We found that participants to six MTurk studies approved of
utilitarian AVs (that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good), and
would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs
that protect their passengers at all costs. They would disapprove of enforcing
utilitarian AVs, and would be less willing to buy such a regulated AV.
Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase
casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology."
"Map matching has been used to reduce the noisiness of the location estimates
by aligning them to the road network on a digital map. A growing number of
applications, e.g. energy-efficient localization and cellular provider side
localization, depend on the availability of only sparse and coarse-grained
positioning data; leading to a challenging map matching process.
  In this paper, we present semMatch: a system that can provide accurate
HMM-based map matching for challenging positioning traces. semMatch leverages
the smartphone's inertial sensors to detect different road semantics; such as
speed bumps, tunnels, and turns; and uses them in a mathe-matically-principled
way as hints to overcome the sparse, noisy, and coarse-grained input
positioning data, improving the HMM map matching accuracy and efficiency. To do
that, semMatch applies a series of preprocessing modules to handle the noisy
locations. The filtered location data is then processed by the core of semMatch
system using a novel incremental HMM algorithm that combines a
semantics-enriched digital map and the car's ambient road semantics in its
estimation process.
  We have evaluated semMatch using traces collected from different cities
covering more than 150km under different harsh scenarios including
coarse-grained cellular-based positioning data, sparse GPS traces with
extremely low sampling rate, and noisy traces with a large number of
back-and-force transitions. The results show that semMatch significantly
outperforms traditional map matching algorithms under all scenarios, with an
enhancement of at least 416% and 894% in precision and recall respectively in
the most difficult cases. This highlights its promise as a next generation map
matching algorithm for challenging environments."
"In everyday life, the process of commuting to work from home happens every
now and then. And the research of commute characteristics is useful for urban
function planning. For humans, the commute of an individual seems revealing no
regular universal patterns, but it is true that people try to find a
satisfactory state of life regarding commute issues. Commute time and distance
are most important indicators to measure the degree of this satisfaction.
Marchetti states a certain regularity in human commute time distribution -
specifically, it states that no matter when, where and how far away people
live, they always tend to spend approximately the same average time for their
daily commute. However, will the rapid development of cities nowadays as well
as serious challenges brought by economic development affect this constant? If
there are novel characteristics? We revisit these problems using fine grained
communication data in two Chinese major cities during recent two years. The
results indicate that the commute time has been slightly increased from
Marchetti's constant with the development of society. People's overall travel
budgets have been increased, more concretely speaking, for medium and long
distance commuters, their endurance limit for commute time is enhanced during
the passing years, and fluctuates around a constant; for short distance
commuters, their commute time increases with the distance. Moreover, the
population distribution in every commute distance shows strong cross-city
similarity and does not change much over two years."
"This work discusses how the MPContribs framework in the Materials Project
(MP) allows user-contributed data to be shown and analyzed alongside the core
MP database. The Materials Project is a searchable database of electronic
structure properties of over 65,000 bulk solid materials that is accessible
through a web-based science-gateway. We describe the motivation for enabling
user contributions to the materials data and present the framework's features
and challenges in the context of two real applications. These use-cases
illustrate how scientific collaborations can build applications with their own
""user-contributed"" data using MPContribs. The Nanoporous Materials Explorer
application provides a unique search interface to a novel dataset of hundreds
of thousands of materials, each with tables of user-contributed values related
to material adsorption and density at varying temperature and pressure. The
Unified Theoretical and Experimental x-ray Spectroscopy application discusses a
full workflow for the association, dissemination and combined analyses of
experimental data from the Advanced Light Source with MP's theoretical core
data, using MPContribs tools for data formatting, management and exploration.
The capabilities being developed for these collaborations are serving as the
model for how new materials data can be incorporated into the Materials Project
website with minimal staff overhead while giving powerful tools for data search
and display to the user community."
"In an effort to foster learning by teaching, we propose the development of a
canvas system that makes composing e-learning modules intuitive. We try to
empower and liberate non-technical module users by lowering the bar for turning
them into module authors, a bar previously set far too high. In turn, this
stimulates learning through teaching. By making a damn fine piece of software,
we furthermore make module authoring more pleasant for experienced authors as
well. We propose a system that initially enables users to easily compose H5P
modules. These modules are successively easy to share and modify. Through
gamification we encourage authors to share their work, and to improve the works
of others."
"There is a marked lack of literature on user-submitted sexual videos from
Latin America. To start filling that gap, we present a formal statistical
testing of several hypotheses about the characteristics of 214 videos from
Nereliatube.com posted from the inauguration of the site until December 2010.
We found that in most cases the video was made consensually and the camera was
operated by the man. The most frequent practice shown was fellatio, followed by
vaginal penetration. The great majority of videos showed the sexual
interactions of one woman with one man; group sex was rare. Violence and
manifestations of power were rare and when there was violence it was mostly
simulated. Latin American user-submitted sexual videos in Nereliatube generally
reflect a society in which women and men have a variety of sexual practices
that are mostly consensual and that do not differ from the biologically and
anthropologically expected patterns."
"Big data is one of the most discussed, and possibly least understood, terms
in use in business today. Big data is said to offer not only unprecedented
levels of business intelligence concerning the habits of consumers and rivals,
but also to herald a revolution in the way in which business are organized and
run. However, big data is not as straightforward as it might seem, particularly
when it comes to the so-called dark data from social media. It is not simply
the quantity of data that has changed, it is also the speed and the variety of
formats with which it is delivered. This article sets out to look at big data
and debunk some of the myths that surround it. It focuses on the role of data
from social media in particular and highlights two common myths about big data.
The first is that because a data set contains billions of items, traditional
methodological issues no longer matter. The second is the belief that big data
is both a complete and unbiased source of data upon which to base decisions."
"The Project aims at improving the efficiency of hospitals and healthcare
centres using Big Data Analytics to evaluate identified KPIs (Key Performance
Indicators) of its various functions. The Dashboards designed using computer
technology serves as an interactive and dynamic tool for various stakeholders,
which helps in optimising performance of various functions and more so maximise
the financial returns. The Project entails improving performance of patient
servicing, operations and OPD departments, finance function, procurement
function, HR function, etc. I developed KPIs and drilldown KPIs for various
functions and assisted in designing and developing interactive Dashboards with
dynamic charts."
"Phishing is an online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive information
such as username, password and online banking details from its victims.
Phishing education needs to be considered as a means to combat this threat.
This paper reports on a design and development of a mobile game prototype as an
educational tool helping computer users to protect themselves against phishing
attacks. The elements of a game design framework for avoiding phishing attacks
were used to address the game design issues. Game design principles served as
guidelines for structuring and presenting information. Our mobile game design
aimed to enhance the users' avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect
themselves against phishing threats. A think-aloud study was conducted, along
with a pre- and post-test, to assess the game design framework though the
developed mobile game prototype. The study results showed a significant
improvement of participants' phishing avoidance behaviour in their post-test
assessment. Furthermore, the study findings suggest that participants' threat
perception, safeguard effectiveness, self-efficacy, perceived severity and
perceived susceptibility elements positively impact threat avoidance behaviour,
whereas safeguard cost had a negative impact on it."
"The aim of this paper is to study m-learning literature in order to propose
and develop a privacy-preserving framework which can be used to foster
sustainable deployment of mobile learning within open and distance education in
Kenya. Location-based privacy in mobile learning is essential to retain users
trust, key to influencing usage intention. Any risk on privacy can negatively
affect users perceptions of a systems reliability and trustworthiness. While
extant studies have proposed frameworks for mobile technologies adoption into
learning, few have integrated privacy aspects and their influence on m-learning
implementation. The framework would provide University management with informed
approach to consider privacy preserving aspects in m-learning implementation.
Also, it could provide enlightened guidance to mobile learning application
developers on the need to cater for learners privacy aspects."
"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder
that affects more that 6 million people worldwide. Motor dysfunction gradually
increases as the disease progress. It is usually mild in the early stages of
the disease but it relentlessly progresses to a severe or very severe
disability that is characterized by increasing degrees of bradykinesia,
hypokinesia, muscle rigidity, loss of postural reflexes and balance control as
well as freezing of gait. In addition to a line of treatment based on
dopaminergic PD-specific drugs, attending neurologists strongly recommend
regular exercise combined with physiotherapy. However, the routine of
traditional rehabilitation often create boredom and loss of interest.
Opportunities to liven up a daily exercise schedule may well take the form of
character-based virtual reality games which engage the player to physically
train in a non-linear and looser fashion, providing an experience that varies
from one game loop the next. Such ""exergames"", a word that results from the
amalgamation of the words ""exercise"" and ""game"" challenge patients into
performing movements of varying complexity in a playful and immersive virtual
environment. In fact, today's game consoles using controllers like Nintendo's
Wii, Sony PlayStation Eye and the Microsoft Kinect sensor present new
opportunities to infuse motivation and variety to an otherwise mundane
physiotherapy routine. But are these controllers and the games built for them
appropriate for PD patients? In this paper we present some of these approaches
and discuss their suitability for these patients mainly on the basis of demands
made on balance, agility and gesture precision."
"Two of the most popular game engines today, Unreal Engine v4.x and Unity Game
Engine v5.x have recently adopted competitive and very appealing pricing
structures for individual game developers and small teams. One may lean towards
one or the other game engine based on various criteria: existing
familiarization / vested interest, steepness of learning curve, quality,
richness, variability and pricing of add-on assets, initial cost of basic
ownership versus subscribing to updates and acquiring needed modules, etc. In
this paper we present complementary features of the Unreal and Unity game
engines that can be combined to enhance understanding game development and to
hone relevant skills. Such combinations of different game engine features can
increase the added value for our undergraduate informatics engineering students
taking a ""Game Technologies"" class."
"Within the context of a 3D interactive strategy game, the EViE platform
allows participants to unlock game features using their knowledge and skills in
various thematic areas such as physics, mathematics, etc. By answering
questions organized by Educational Objective in stratified levels of
difficulty, users gather points which grant them access to desired world
elements. Richer world components become increasingly more difficult to access,
so that a players' individual (or cumulative if in a group) knowledge, ability
and / or dexterity is directly reflected by the level of complication of their
virtual world. In the present article we report on the communication
architecture of the platform and focus on framework components that allow group
activities such as cooperation (within the group to facilitate e.g.,
collaboration on more difficult problems), (inter-group) competition as well as
practice and skill honing activities (in single or in multi-player mode)."
"The phenomenon of the use of a mobile learning (m-Learning) platform in
educational institutions is slowly gaining momentum. While this can be taken as
an encouraging sign, the perplexing part is that the fervor with which mobile
phones have been welcomed into every aspect of our lives does not seem to be
evident in the educational sector. In order to understand the reason, it is
important to understand user expectations of the system. This paper documents a
systematic review of various research studies seeking to find the success
factors for effective m-Learning. A total of 30 studies were included in the
research, which combined would give a true picture of user perceptions of the
factors they consider important for effective m-Learning implementation. Our
systematic review collates results from 30 studies conducted in 17 countries,
where 13 critical success factors (CSFs) were found to strongly impact
m-Learning."
"Game development is an interdisciplinary concept that embraces software
engineering, business, management, and artistic disciplines. This research
facilitates a better understanding of the business dimension of digital games.
The main objective of this research is to investigate empirically the effect of
business factors on the performance of digital games in the market and to
answer the research questions asked in this study. Game development
organizations are facing high pressure and competition in the digital game
industry. Business has become a crucial dimension, especially for game
development organizations. The main contribution of this paper is to
investigate empirically the influence of key business factors on the business
performance of games. This is the first study in the domain of game development
that demonstrates the interrelationship between key business factors and game
performance in the market. The results of the study provide evidence that game
development organizations must deal with multiple business key factors to
remain competitive and handle the high pressure in the digital game industry.
Furthermore, the results of the study support the theoretical assertion that
key business factors play an important role in game business performance."
"Cloud Computing is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in
servers on the Internet and temporarily stored on the user's computer (client)
including the desktop. This study aims to design an online sales application
based cloud computing technology to help the artisans Palembang songket and do
not rule out the possibility for other small medium enterprises (SMEs) to
manage assets and market their products online so it can be accessed anytime
and anywhere via personal computer, laptop, tabblet, mobile phone or
smartphone. Cloud infrastructure used in this study is a Software-as-a-service
(SaaS) that enables cloud users to exploit online sales application without
having to install on your local computer, set up a dedicated server, operator
labor, maintenance costs and other support resources that can make savings in
terms of cost."
"The election narrative is formed under the competitions of ideas among
critical players involving politicians, news media, public influentials, and
the general public. Untangling the complex process of narrative formation,
however, is no easy task due to implicit influences among the key players. This
paper outlines a conceptual framework to untangle this complex process. We
propose the problem of measuring ""responsiveness"" that quantifies a player's
influence on another given a specific election topic over time. In particular,
we make use of multivariate Hawkes Process to infer the influence network
between pairs of election players. We demonstrate an early version system of
analytic pipeline of online public sphere discussions from data ingestion,
influence inference, to visualization. The paper concludes by showcasing some
preliminary results based on Twitter and news media election-related contents
from July to October 2015 and discussing plans for future research."
"Managers regularly face a complex ethical dilemma over how to best govern
online communities by evaluating the effectiveness of different social or
technical strategies. What ethical considerations should guide researchers and
managers when they employ causal research methods that make different community
members bear different risks and benefits, under different levels of consent?
We introduce a structural framework for evaluating the flows of risks and
benefits in social systems with multiple interacting parties. This framework
has implications for understanding the governmentality of managing
socio-technical systems, for making research ethics discussions more
commensurable, and for enumerating alternative goals researchers might pursue
with interventions."
"Web intelligence can be considered as a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It
uses existing data in web to produce new data, knowledge and wisdom to support
decision making and new predictions for web users. Artificial Intelligence is
ever changing and evolving field of computer science and it is extensively used
in wide array of web based business applications. Although it is used
substantially in web based systems in developed countries, it is not examined
whether it is being substantially used in Sri Lanka. Every Sri Lankan citizen
depends on Public Service more or less throughout his/ her life time and at
least more than 3 times: at birth, marriage and death. So providing most of
these services to its citizen, Sri Lankan Government uses more or less of its
country web portal. This paper presents a model to evaluate web intelligence
capability based on weight to key functionalities with respect to web
intelligence. The government websites were checked by the proposed criteria to
show the potential of using web intelligent technology to provide website based
services. The result indicates that the use of web intelligence techniques
openly and publicly to provide web based services through government web portal
to its citizens is not satisfactory. It also indicates that lack of using the
technologies pertaining to web intelligence in the public service web hinders
the most of the advantages that citizen and government can gain from such
technological involvement."
"Dengue fever is a disease which is transmitted and caused by Aedes Aegypti
mosquitos. Dengue has become a serious health issue in all over the world
especially in those countries who are situated in tropical or subtropical
regions because rain is an important factor for growth and increase in the
population of dengue transmitting mosquitos. For a long time, data mining
algorithms have been used by the scientists for the diagnosis and prognosis of
different diseases which includes dengue as well. This was a study to analyses
the attack of dengue fever in different areas of district Jhelum, Pakistan in
2011. As per our knowledge, we are unaware of any kind of research study in the
area of district Jhelum for diagnosis or analysis of dengue fever. According to
our information, we are the first one researching and analyzing dengue fever in
this specific area. Dataset was obtained from the office of Executive District
Officer EDO (health) District Jhelum. We applied DBSCAN algorithm for the
clustering of dengue fever. First we showed overall behavior of dengue in the
district Jhelum. Then we explained dengue fever at tehsil level with the help
of geographical pictures. After that we have elaborated comparison of different
clustering algorithms with the help of graphs based on our dataset. Those
algorithms include k-means, K-mediods, DBSCAN and OPTICS."
"There has been a long standing tradition amongst developed nations of
influencing, both directly and indirectly, the activities of developing
economies. Behind this is one of a range of aims: building/improving living
standards, bettering the social status of recipient communities, etc. In some
cases, this has resulted in prosperous relations, yet often this has been seen
as the exploitation of a power position or a veneer for other activities (e.g.
to tap into new emerging markets). In this paper, we explore whether
initiatives to improve Internet connectivity in developing regions are always
ethical. We draw a list of issues that would aid in formulating Internet
initiatives that are ethical, effective, and sustainable."
"Numerous strategies have been adopted in order to make the process of
learning simple, efficient and within less amount of time.. Classroom learning
is slowly replaced by E-learning and M- learning. These techniques involve the
usage of computers, smart phones and tablets for the process of learning.
Learning from the internet has become popular among the e-learners where
learner tends to rely greatly upon information provided by the World Wide Web.
However, the e-learners have to go through a huge volume of data produced by
the first tier search engine, some of which are not suited to the interest of
the user. Various strategies, namely Statistical Learning and Adaptive
Learning, have been adopted to cater to the need of the user and produce data
best suited to the interest of the user. The authors have tried to present a
comparative study of Statistical Learning and Adaptive Learning based on
certain parameters, which arise from the characteristics of the learning
process. As a consequence of the comparative study, it has been concluded that
Adaptive learning is more efficient than Statistical learning."
"There is a growing relationship between academic libraries and cloud
computing. Therefore, understanding the beginnings and the current use of cloud
base services in libraries is important. This will help understand the factors
that libraries should consider in the future. The purpose of this paper is to
better understand the future implementation of the cloud based software in
academic settings. Using cloud based, web based, and other remote services may
bring both advantages and disadvantages, some of which this paper will bring
out. First, a brief literature review of the academic literature, and a review
of available general-purpose cloud-based library products are conducted. Next,
a real-life scenario for a mid-sized New Zealand institution of higher
education is evaluated. This case involves moving from a locally hosted version
of EZproxy to a cloud based version with support from the vendor. As this
information system decision is an important one, this paper makes a
contribution to the available literature and can be informative for librarians.
In conclusion, academic libraries will gradually involve more pervasive use of
cloud based systems. The examples of important factors to be considered in
future decisions include timing and staffing."
"Computer games play an important role in our society and motivate people to
learn computer science. Since artificial intelligence is integral to most
games, they can also be used to teach artificial intelligence. We introduce the
Game AI Game Engine (GAIGE), a Python game engine specifically designed to
teach about how AI is used in computer games. A progression of seven
assignments builds toward a complete, working Multi-User Battle Arena (MOBA)
game. We describe the engine, the assignments, and our experiences using it in
a class on Game Artificial Intelligence."
"Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050
to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion
people. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average
of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as
high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers
around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the
potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse
communities growing food. One potential application is the development of
mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Here we
announce the release of over 50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and
infected leaves of crops plants through the existing online platform
PlantVillage. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the
beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision
approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to
infectious diseases."
"In the era of m-Learning, it is found that educational institutions have onus
of incorporating the latest technological innovations that can be accepted and
understood widely. While investigating the important theme of fast-paced
development of emerging technologies in mobile communications, it is important
to recognize the extent influence of these innovations using which society can
communicate, learn, access information, and, additionally, interact. In
addition, the usage of mobile technology in higher education needs not only the
pervasive nature of the technology but also its disruptive nature that offers
several challenges while incorporation in the area of teaching and learning.
Therefore, recently, higher education institutions are looking at various ways
of implementing m-Learning strategies, in order to offer solutions, which, in
turn, can standardize the process of education and, additionally, replace those
traditional didactic courses, focusing on m-Learning endless benefits. Some of
the benefits are: the process of learning itself could be self-paced, whereas
information could be easier accessed, adding to independent, discovery-oriented
learning that becomes more engaging. Applying CMM successfully to design
effective incorporation strategies of m-Learning, this research targets
formulation of such a maturity model by which the process of m-Learning can be
more effective and efficient."
"As a result of the increased dependency on obtaining information and
connecting each computer together for ease of access or communication,
organizations risk being attacked and losing private information through
breaches or insecure business activities. To help protect organizations and
their assets, companies need to develop a strong understanding of the risks
imposed on their company and the security solutions designed to prevent or
minimize vulnerabilities. To reduce the impact threats have on a network,
organizations need to: design a defense layer system that provides multiple
instances of protection to prevent unauthorized access to core information,
implement a strong network hardware/intrusion prevention system, and create
all-inclusive network or security policies that detail user rules and company
rights. In order to enhance the overall security of a basic infrastructure,
this paper will provide a detailed look into gathering the organizational
requirements, designing and implementing a secure physical network layout, and
selecting the standards needed to prevent unauthorized access"
"Social media have become a significant venue for information sharing of live
updates. Users of social media are producing and sharing large amount of
personal data as a part of the live updates. A significant percentage of this
data contains location information that can be used by other people for many
purposes. Some of the social media users deliberately share their own location
information with other social network users. However, a large number of social
media users blindly or implicitly share their location without noticing it or
its possible consequences. Implicit location sharing is investigated in the
current paper. We perform a large scale study on implicit location sharing for
one of the most popular social media platform, namely Twitter. After a careful
study, we built a dataset of Turkish tweets and manually tagged them. Using
machine learning techniques we built classifiers that are able to classify
whether a given tweet contains implicit location sharing or not. The
classifiers are shown to be very accurate and efficient. Moreover, the best
classifier is employed as a browser add-on tool which warns the user whenever
an implicit location sharing is predicted from to be released tweet. The paper
provides the methodology and the technical analysis as well. Furthermore, it
discusses how these techniques can be extended to different social network
services and also to different languages."
"This work discusses an important issue in the area of human resource
management by proposing a novel model for creation and evaluation of software
teams. The model consists of several assessments, including a technical test, a
quality of life test and a psychological-sociological test. Since the technical
test requires particular organizational specifications and cannot be examined
without reference to a specific company, only the sociological test and the
quality of life tests are extensively discussed in this work. Two strategies
are discussed for assigning roles in a project. Initially, six software
projects were selected, and after extensive analysis of the projects, two
projects were chosen and correctives actions were applied. An empirical
evaluation was also conducted to assess the model effectiveness. The
experimental results demonstrate that the application of the model improved the
productivity of project teams."
"The focus of this paper is on wearable technologies which are increasingly
being employed in the medical field. From smart watches to smart glasses, from
electronic textile to data gloves; several gadgets are playing important roles
in diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions. The threats posed by
these technologies are another matter of concern that must be seriously taken
into account. Numerous threats ranging from data privacy to big data problems
are facing us as adverse effects of these technologies. The paper analyses the
application areas and challenges of wearable technologies from a technical and
ethical point of view and presents solutions to possible threats."
"The development of information technology and Internet has led to rapidly
progressed in e-commerce and online shopping, due to the convenience that they
provide consumers. E-commerce and online shopping are still not able to fully
replace onsite shopping. In contrast, conventional online shopping websites
often cannot provide enough information about a product for the customer to
make an informed decision before checkout. 3D virtual shopping environment show
great potential for enhancing e-commerce systems and provide customers
information about a product and real shopping environment. This paper presents
a new type of e-commerce system, which obviously brings virtual environment
online with an active 3D model that allows consumers to access products into
real physical environments for user interaction. Such system with easy process
can helps customers make better purchasing decisions that allows users to
manipulate 3D virtual models online. The stores participate in the 3D virtual
mall by communicating with a mall management. The 3D virtual mall allows
shoppers to perform actions across multiple stores simultaneously such as
viewing product availability. The mall management can authenticate clients on
all stores participating in the 3D virtual mall while only requiring clients to
provide authentication information once. 3D virtual shopping online mall
convenient and easy process allow consumers directly buy goods or services from
a seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. The
virtual mall with an active 3D model is implemented by using 3D Language (VRML)
and asp.net as the script language for shopping online pages"
"Now-a-days, people are getting more health conscious and tend to keep a check
on nutritional gain from the packed food products they consume. This
application christened 'healthWISE' helps a mobile user to scan/enter the
bar-code on the packed food product, know the nutritional information, and upon
entering the quantity to be consumed, it displays the energy the individual can
consume. If the user has exceeded the stipulated amount of calories, then it
suggests the exercise to burn the extra number of calories."
"Poor software quality can adversely affect application security by increasing
the potential for a malicious breach of a system. Because computer security and
cybersecurity are becoming such relevant topics for practicing software
engineers, the need for educational opportunities in this area is steadily
increasing. Universities and colleges have recognized this, and have started to
offer programs in cybersecurity. At face value, these new programs may not
appear controversial, but developing their curriculum requires answering a
complex ethical question: Should programs teach hacking to their students? Even
though there are different types of hackers, media reports of cybersecurity
incidents tend to reserve the ""hacker"" label for cyber criminals, which
overlooks the value in hacking (and, by extension, teaching students to hack).
This article examines the full spectrum of hacking behavior, as well as
arguments for and against including hacking in education programs, and
recommends that hacking skills be considered an essential component of an
education and practice in software quality assurance."
"So far, Google Trend data have been used for influenza surveillance in many
European and American countries; however, there are few attempts to apply the
low-cost surveillance method in Asian developing countries. To investigate the
correlation between the search trends and the influenza activity in Asia, we
examined the Google query data of four Asian developing countries."
"Bring Your Own Device, also known under the term BOYD refers to the trend in
employees bringing their personal mobile devices into organisations to use as a
primary device for their daily work activities. With the rapid development in
computing technology in smartphones and tablet computers and innovations in
mobile software and applications, mobile devices are becoming ever more
powerful tools for consumers to access information. Consumers are becoming more
inseparable from their personal mobile devices and development in mobile
technologies within the consumer space has led to the significance of
Consumerization. Enterprises everywhere want to introduce BYOD strategies to
improve mobility and productivity of their employees. However making the
necessary organizational changes to adopt BYOD may require a shift away from
centralized systems towards more open enterprise systems and this change can
present challenges to enterprises in particular over security, control,
technology and policy to the traditional IT model within organisations. This
paper explores some of the present challenges and solutions in relation to
mobile security, technology and policy that enterprise systems within
organisations can encounter. This paper also reviews real-life studies where
such changes were made in organisations aiming to implement BYOD. This paper
proposes a mobile enterprise model that aims to address security concerns and
the challenges of technology and policy change. This paper ends with looking
ahead to the future of mobile enterprise systems."
"Belarusian State University is currently developing the educational and
research web portal of nuclear knowledge BelNET (Belarusian Nuclear Education
and Training Portal). In the future, this specialized electronic portal could
grow into a national portal of nuclear knowledge. The concept, structure and
taxonomy of BelNET portal are developed. The requirements and conditions for
its functioning are analyzed. The information model and architecture of the
portal, as well as algorithms and methods of software are realized. At present,
BelNET software implemented all the basic functions of this portal, including
the ability to remotely (via the Internet) open content editing, sorting,
filtering, etc. Filling the BelNET by knowledge is at the beginning."
"The astronomical growth of data has necessitated the need for educating
well-qualified data scientists to derive deep insights from large and complex
data sets generated by organizations. In this paper, we present our
interdisciplinary approach and experiences in teaching a Data Science course,
the first of its kind offered at the Wright State University. Two faculty
members from the Management Information Systems (MIS) and Computer Science (CS)
departments designed and co-taught the course with perspectives from their
previous research and teaching experiences. Students in the class had mix
backgrounds with mainly MIS and CS majors. Students' learning outcomes and post
course survey responses suggested that the course delivered a broad overview of
data science as desired, and that students worked synergistically with those of
different majors in collaborative lab assignments and in a semester long
project. The interdisciplinary pedagogy helped build collaboration and create
satisfaction among learners."
"An important hypothesis in the study of media-defined as the means of mass
communication-is that media affect our historical records by biasing the types
of content that we can transmit (e.g. film or audio recordings) and the amount
of content we can record. Here we test this hypothesis by looking at data on
historical characters, and their occupations, as a proxy for the amount and
type of information we now remember from each historical period. We find that
changes in communication technologies, including the introduction of printing
and the maturity of shorter forms of printed media-such as newspapers,
journals, and pamphlets-were accompanied by sharp increases in the number of
memorable biographies from a time period that are present in current online and
offline sources. Moreover, we find that changes in media technology, such as
the introduction of printing, film, radio, and television, coincide with sharp
shifts in the occupations associated with the individuals present in both of
these biographical records. These findings suggest that communication
technologies shape our species historical records by constraining the amount
and types of information we can record."
"Emerging technologies, such as big data, Internet of things, cloud computing,
mobile Internet, and robotics, breed and expedite new applications and fields.
In the mean while, the long-term prosperity and happiness of human race demands
advanced technologies. In this paper, the aforementioned emerging technologies
are applied to management and governance for the long-term prosperity and
happiness of human race. The term ""machine ruling"" is coined, introduced, and
justified. Moreover, the framework and architecture of machine ruling are
proposed. Enabling technologies and challenges are discussed."
"The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a comprehensive environment that
consists of large number of sensors and mediators interconnecting heterogeneous
physical objects to the Internet. IoT applications can be found in many areas
such as smart city, smart workplace, smart plants, smart agriculture and
various ubiquitous computing areas. Meanwhile, Business Process Management
Systems (BPMS) has become a successful and efficient solution for coordinated
management and optimised utilisation of resources/entities. However, managing
large scale connected heterogeneous IoT entities in BPMS is facing many issues
that were not considered in the past BPMS. Without fully understanding the
behaviour, capability and state of the thing, the BPMS can fail to manage the
IoT integrated information systems. In this paper, we analyse existing BPMS for
IoT and identify the limitations and their drawbacks. Then, we try to improve
the existing works with the elastic mobile cloud resources. The aim of this
paper is to provide a guidance to Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) disciplines what
are the issues in BPMS for IoT and how MCC can be the promising solution to
address issues and overcome the challenges."
"The literature on well being measurement seems to suggest that ""asking"" for a
self-evaluation is the only way to estimate a complete and reliable measure of
well being. At the same time ""not asking"" is the only way to avoid biased
evaluations due to self-reporting. Here we propose a method for estimating the
welfare perception of a community simply ""listening"" to the conversations on
Social Network Sites. The Social Well Being Index (SWBI) and its components are
proposed through to an innovative technique of supervised sentiment analysis
called iSA which scales to any language and big data. As main methodological
advantages, this approach can estimate several aspects of social well being
directly from self-declared perceptions, instead of approximating it through
objective (but partial) quantitative variables like GDP; moreover
self-perceptions of welfare are spontaneous and not obtained as answers to
explicit questions that are proved to bias the result. As an application we
evaluate the SWBI in Italy through the period 2012-2015 through the analysis of
more than 143 millions of tweets."
"We describe the experimental methodology developed and employed in a series
of experiments within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

where integrated political-military-economic-social-infrastructure and
information (PMESII) considerations play decisive roles. As part of the
program, our team executed several broad-based experiments, involving dozens of
experts from several agencies simultaneously. The methodology evolved from one
experiment to another because of the lessons learned. The paper presents the
motivation, objectives, and structure of this interagency experiment series;
the methods we explored in the experiments; and the results, lessons learned
and recommendations for future efforts of such nature."
"The impact of MOOC courses in the processes of distance learning has been
extremely important from the very beginning. They offer an innovative model of
massive teaching, which exploits in a paradigmatic manner the potential and
relevance that ICT's currently have in modern society. The present article has
as its primary objective the analysis of the presence of these courses and the
role that they represent in teacher training, and their knowledge and influence
on the future teachers that are currently being formed at university level. A
case study has been carried out with descriptive not experimental methodology,
from a quantitative base. The sample study has been undertaken in Spain
(n=200). Its main result being the determination of the minimal impact that the
MOOC phenomenon has had on the students polled. Equally, a significant lack of
knowledge has been revealed in all its dimensions (professional, pedagogical,
structural, etc.), with only a minority of those in the sample group having
indicated that they have studied any of the courses, or know to some extent the
main platforms of the world in which they are offered. A large number of those
surveyed therefore are unaware of the existence of these courses. As a result,
it has been established that, regardless of the quality of the learning and the
didactic and methodological characteristics that the MOOC courses offer, their
study and analysis is considered necessary for future educational
professionals. It is imperative that at the level of Higher Education, and
especially in the faculties of teacher training, that the most recent advances
in the field of ICT's are introduced in the study plan and in the academic
programs, for they constitute the base of modern society."
"Really Simple Syndication (RSS) offers a means for university students to
receive timely updates from virtual learning environments. However, despite its
utility, only 21% of students surveyed at a Lebanese university claim to have
ever used the technology. To investigate whether a cultural influence is
affecting intention to use RSS, the survey was extended to the British context
to conduct a cross-cultural comparison. Using the Technology Adoption Model
(TAM) as a research framework, 437 students responded to a questionnaire
containing four constructs: intention to use (INT); attitude towards benefit
(ATT); perceived usefulness (PU); and perceived ease of use (PEOU). Principle
components analysis (PCA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to
explore the psychometric qualities of the scale. The results show that adoption
was significantly higher, but also modest, in the British context at 36%.
Configural and metric invariance were fully supported, while scalar and
factorial invariance were partially supported. Analysis reveals that, as a
potential consequence of culture, there are significant differences between PU
and PEOU across the two contexts studied, potentially as a consequence of
culture. It is recommended that faculty demonstrate to students how RSS can be
used effectively in order to increase awareness and emphasise usefulness."
"Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a smartphone-based
high-frequency remote monitoring platform, assess its feasibility for remote
monitoring of symptoms in Parkinson's disease, and demonstrate the value of
data collected using the platform by detecting dopaminergic medication
response. Methods: We have developed HopkinsPD, a novel smartphone-based
monitoring platform, which measures symptoms actively (i.e. data are collected
when a suite of tests is initiated by the individual at specific times during
the day), and passively (i.e. data are collected continuously in the
background). After data collection, we extract features to assess measures of
five key behaviors related to PD symptoms -- voice, balance, gait, dexterity,
and reaction time. A random forest classifier is used to discriminate
measurements taken after a dose of medication (treatment) versus before the
medication dose (baseline). Results: A worldwide study for remote PD monitoring
was established using HopkinsPD in July, 2014. This study used entirely remote,
online recruitment and installation, demonstrating highly cost-effective
scalability. In six months, 226 individuals (121 PD and 105 controls)
contributed over 46,000 hours of passive monitoring data and approximately
8,000 instances of structured tests of voice, balance, gait, reaction, and
dexterity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have
collected data at such a scale for remote PD monitoring. Moreover, we
demonstrate the initial ability to discriminate treatment from baseline with
71.0(+-0.4)% accuracy, which suggests medication response can be monitored
remotely via smartphone-based measures."
"Pervasive social computing is a promising approach that promises to empower
both the individual and the whole and thus candidates itself as a foundation to
the ""smarter"" social organizations that our new turbulent and resource-scarce
worlds so urgently requires. In this contribution we first identify those that
we consider as the major requirements to be fulfilled in order to realize an
effective pervasive social computing infrastructure. We then conjecture that
our service-oriented community and fractal social organization fulfill those
requirements and therefore constitute an effective strategy to design pervasive
social computing infrastructures. In order to motivate our conjecture, in this
paper we discuss a model of social translucence and discuss fractal social
organization as a referral service empowering a social system's parts and
whole."
"Small and Medium size Enterprises (SME) are considered as a backbone of many
developing and developed economies of the world; they are the driving force to
any major economy across the globe. Through Cloud Computing firms outsource
their entire information technology (IT) process while concentrating more on
their core business. It allows businesses to cut down heavy cost incurred over
IT infrastructure without losing focus on customer needs. However, Cloud
industry to an extent has struggled to grow among SMEs due to the reluctance
and concerns expressed by them. Throughout the course of this study several
interviews were conducted and the literature was reviewed to understand how
cloud providers offer services and what challenges SMEs are facing. The study
identified issues like cloud knowledge, interoperability, security and
contractual concerns to be hindering SMEs adoption of cloud services. From the
interviews common practices followed by cloud vendors and what concerns SMEs
have were identified as a basis for a cloud framework which will bridge gaps
between cloud vendors and SMEs. A stepwise framework for cloud adoption is
formulated which identifies and provides recommendation to four most
predominant challenges which are hurting cloud industry and taking SMEs away
from cloud computing, as well as guide SMEs aiding in successful cloud
adoption. Moreover, this framework streamlines the cloud adoption process for
SMEs by removing ambiguity in regards to fundamentals associated with their
organisation and cloud adoption process."
"Tweaking citizen participation is vital in promoting Smart City services.
However, conventional practices deficit sufficient realization of personal
traits despite socio-economic promise. The recent trend of IoT-enabled
smart-objects/things and personalized services pave the way for context-aware
services. Eventually, the aim of this paper is to develop a context-aware model
in predicting participation of smart city service. Hence, major requirements
are identified for citizen participation, namely (a) unwrapping of contexts,
which are relevant, (b) scaling up (over time) of participation. However,
paramount challenges are imposed on this stipulation, such as,
un-observability, independence and composite relationship of contexts.
Therefore, a Non-parametric Bayesian model is proposed to address scalability
of contexts and its relationship with participation."

"There is often a fundamental mismatch between programmable privacy
frameworks, on the one hand, and the ever shifting privacy expectations of
computer system users, on the other hand. Based on the theory of contextual
integrity (CI), our paper addresses this problem by proposing a privacy
framework that translates users' privacy expectations (norms) into a set of
actionable privacy rules that are rooted in the language of CI. These norms are
then encoded using Datalog logic specification to develop an information system
that is able to verify whether information flows are appropriate and the
privacy of users thus preserved. A particular benefit of our framework is that
it can automatically adapt as users' privacy expectations evolve over time.
  To evaluate our proposed framework, we conducted an extensive survey
involving more than 450 participants and 1400 questions to derive a set of
privacy norms in the educational context. Based on the crowdsourced responses,
we demonstrate that our framework can derive a compact Datalog encoding of the
privacy norms which can in principle be directly used for enforcing privacy of
information flows within this context. In addition, our framework can
automatically detect logical inconsistencies between individual users' privacy
expectations and the derived privacy logic."
"Ameliorating elderly engagement is vital in rejuvenating independent living.
However, recommended practices lack realization of personal traits despite
socio -economic promise. The recent proliferation of IoT with the advent of
smart-objects/things and personalized services pave the way for context-aware

context-aware model in predicting engagement of elderly care. Hence, key
requirements are identified for elderly engagement, namely (a) discovery of
contexts, which are relevant (b) scaling up (over time) of engagement. However,
paramount challenges are imposed on this stipulation, such as,
un-observability, independence and composite relationship of contexts.
Therefore, a Topic-model based model is proposed to address scalability of
contexts and its conjugal relationship with engagement. Eventually, systematic
framework is demonstrated, which pinpoints key goals of context-aware services
by participants' opinions, usage and feed-back."
"Wine counterfeiting is not a new problem, however, the situation in China has
been going worse even after Hong Kong manifested itself as a wine trading and
distribution center with abolishing all taxes on wine in 2008. The most basic
method, printing a fake label with a subtly misspelled brand name or a slightly
different logo in hopes of fooling wine consumers, has been common to other
luxury-goods markets prone to counterfeiting. More ambitious counterfeiters
might remove an authentic label and place it on a bottle with a similar shape,
usually from the same vineyard, which contains a cheaper wine. Savvy buyers
could identify if the cork does not match the label, but how many normal
consumers like us could manage to identify the fake with only eye scanning?
  NFC facilitates processing of wine products information, making it a
promising technology for anti-counterfeiting. The proposed system is aimed at
relatively high-end consumer products like wine, and it helps protect genuine
wine by maintaining the product pedigree such as the transaction records and
the supply chain integrity. As such, consumers can safeguard their stake by
authenticating a specific wine with their NFC-enabled smartphones before making
payment at retail points.
  NFC has emerged as a potential tool to combat wine and spirit counterfeiting,
undermining international wine trading market and even the global economy
hugely. Recently, a number of anti-counterfeiting approaches have been proposed
and adopted utilising different authentication technologies for such purpose.
The project presents an NFC-enabled anti-counterfeiting system, and addresses
possible implementation issues, such as tag selection, tag programming and
encryption, setup of back-end database servers and the design of NFC mobile
application."
"This paper presents the experiences in building and implementing a 3D
avatar-based virtual world (3D-AVW) as a VLE (3D-AVLE) for the Technological
University of the Philippines-Taguig (TUP-T), a higher education institution
(HEI) in the Philippines. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) systems were
used, such as the OpenSimulator and various 3D renderers, to create a replica
of the TUP-T campus in a simulated 3D world. The 3D-AVLE runs in a single
server that is connected to the learners' computers via a simply-wired local
area network (LAN). The use of various networking optimization techniques was
experimented on to provide the learners and the instructors alike a seamless
experience and lag-less immersion within the 3D-AVLE. With the current LAN
setup in TUP-T, the optimal number of concurrent users that can be accommodated
without sacrificing connectivity and the quality of virtual experience was
found to be at 30 users, exactly the mean class size in TUP-T. The 3D-AVLE
allows for recording of the learners' experiences which provides the learners a
facility to review the lessons at a later time. Classes in fundamental topics
in engineering sciences were conducted using the usual teaching aid
technologies such as the presentation software, and by dragging-and-dropping
the presentation files to the 3D-AVLE, resulting to increased learning curve by
both the instructors and the learners."

"Since we started measuring the community of GitHub users in Spain, it has
kept increasing in numbers in such a way that it has grown almost 50%, to the
current 12000, in less than one year. However, the reasons for this are not
clear. In this paper we will try to find out what are the different components
in this growth, or at least those that can be measured, in order to find out
which ones are due to the measurement itself and which might be due to other
reasons. In this paper we make an advance towards finding out the reasons for
this growth."
"EU Directive 95/46/EC and the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation
grant Europeans the right of access to data pertaining to them. Consumers can
approach their service providers to obtain all personal data stored and
processed there. Furthermore, they can demand erasure (or correction) of their
data. We conducted an undercover field study to determine whether these rights
can be exerted in practice. We assessed the behaviour of the vendors of 150
smartphone apps and 120 websites that are popular in Germany. Our deletion
requests were fulfilled in 52 to 57% of the cases and less than half of the
data provision requests were answered satisfactorily. Further, we observed
instances of carelessness: About 20% of website owners would have disclosed our
personal data to impostors. The results indicate that exerting privacy rights
that have been introduced two decades ago is still a frustrating endeavour most
of the time."
"Appointment scheduling systems are utilized mainly by specialty care clinics
to manage access to service providers as well as by hospitals to schedule
patient appointments. When attending hospitals in Tanzania, patients experience
challenges to see an appropriate specialist doctor because of service interval
inconsistency. Timely availability of doctors is critical whenever a patient
needs to see a specialist doctor for treatment and a serious bottleneck lies in
the application of appropriate technology techniques to enhance appointment

system for managing patient appointments. Furthermore, forthcoming
opportunities for the innovative use of the mobile based application scheduling
system are identified."
"The use of ATMs has become fundamental in the banking industry owing to the
values transacted using these systems and their 24/7 usage. Although several
researchers have studied the role of biometrics in security applications for
financial institutions, no systematic empirical research has been applied to
studying the role of organizational characteristics and contextual factors in
the Kenyan financial sector. This study sought to develop a framework for the
adoption of biometric ATMs in the Kenyan banking sector, apply the developed
framework to study factors influencing adoption of biometric ATM authentication
and validate the developed conceptual framework. A survey was used to collect
quantitative data from the ATM users which was then analysed using factor
analysis and multiple regression analysis. The study established that
performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy
were key determinants for biometric ATMs acceptance, adoption and usage. The
study further demonstrated that age, gender and experience were moderating
factors on effort expectancy with experience further moderating performance
expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy. Key words:
Key words: framework, adoption, authentication, financial institutions"
"Functional technical performance usually follows an exponential dependence on
time but the rate of change (the exponent) varies greatly among technological
domains. This paper presents a simple model that provides an explanatory
foundation for these phenomena based upon the inventive design process.
  The model assumes that invention - novel and useful design- arises through
probabilistic analogical transfers that combine existing knowledge by combining
existing individual operational ideas to arrive at new individual operating
ideas. The continuing production of individual operating ideas relies upon
injection of new basic individual operating ideas that occurs through coupling
of science and technology simulations.
  The individual operational ideas that result from this process are then
modeled as being assimilated in components of artifacts characteristic of a
technological domain. According to the model, two effects (differences in
interactions among components for different domains and differences in scaling
laws for different domains) account for the differences found in improvement
rates among domains whereas the analogical transfer process is the source of
the exponential behavior. The model is supported by a number of known empirical
facts: further empirical research is suggested to independently assess further
predictions made by the model."

"Every year in each university many students are graduated holding a first
university degree. For example Bachelor degree in Computer Science. Most of
those students have a motivation to continue with further studies to get higher
education level degree in universities. However, some other students may have
enthusiasm towards working based on their skills that they got during their
life of studies in university. In both cases, it is required that applicant
must pass a test that comprise the entire subject that they learned before. For
this reasons, this research is proposing a new technique to evaluate graduate
students skills."

"With the explosion of social media sites and proliferation of digital
computing devices and Internet access, massive amounts of public data is being
generated on a daily basis. Efficient techniques/ algorithms to analyze this
massive amount of data can provide near real-time information about emerging
trends and provide early warning in case of an imminent emergency (such as the
outbreak of a viral disease). In addition, careful mining of these data can
reveal many useful indicators of socioeconomic and political events, which can
help in establishing effective public policies. The focus of this study is to
review the application of big data analytics for the purpose of human
development. The emerging ability to use big data techniques for development
(BD4D) promises to revolutionalize healthcare, education, and agriculture;
facilitate the alleviation of poverty; and help to deal with humanitarian
crises and violent conflicts. Besides all the benefits, the large-scale
deployment of BD4D is beset with several challenges due to the massive size,
fast-changing and diverse nature of big data. The most pressing concerns relate
to efficient data acquisition and sharing, establishing of context (e.g.,
geolocation and time) and veracity of a dataset, and ensuring appropriate
privacy. In this study, we provide a review of existing BD4D work to study the
impact of big data on the development of society. In addition to reviewing the
important works, we also highlight important challenges and open issues."
"Disasters have long been a scourge for humanity. With the advances in
technology (in terms of computing, communications, and the ability to process
and analyze big data), our ability to respond to disasters is at an inflection
point. There is great optimism that big data tools can be leveraged to process
the large amounts of crisis-related data (in the form of user generated data in
addition to the traditional humanitarian data) to provide an insight into the
fast-changing situation and help drive an effective disaster response. This
article introduces the history and the future of big crisis data analytics,
along with a discussion on its promise, challenges, and pitfalls."
"Social and collaborative services have widely spread within the enterprises
as they play a part in improving productivity and business outcomes. However,
the deployment of these services fluctuates between success and failure. This
paper intends to assess their deployment and how they can contribute to value
creation in different industries. We investigate the relationship between the
services' functionalities and the organizational requirement of these services
represented by the coordination. We also consider the organizational
transformation driven by servitization and emphasize its impact on the act of
coordination. We highlight the tight correlation between the functionalities
and the requirement in organic forms which suggests a successful deployment in
such enterprises. We nonetheless find that, when the servitization is a
strategic intent in organizations with mechanistic characteristics, deploying
social and collaborative services can contribute to achieving this aim."
"Career guidance for students, particularly in rural areas is a challenging
issue in India. In the present era of digitalization, there is a need of an
automated system that can analyze a student for his/her capabilities, suggest a
career and provide related information. Keeping in mind the requirement, the
present paper is an effort in this direction. In this paper, a fuzzy based
conceptual framework has been suggested. It has two parts; in the first part a
students will be analyzed for his/her capabilities and in the second part the
available courses, job aspects related to their capabilities will be suggested.
To analyze a student, marks in various subject in 10+2 standards and vocational
interest in different fields have been considered and fuzzy sets have been
formed. On example basis, fuzzy inference rules have been framed for analyzing
the abilities in engineering, medical and hospitality fields only. In second
part, concept of composition of relations has been used to suggest the related
courses and jobs."
"The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department (AFRD), like many municipal fire
departments, actively works to reduce fire risk by inspecting commercial
properties for potential hazards and fire code violations. However, AFRD's fire
inspection practices relied on tradition and intuition, with no existing
data-driven process for prioritizing fire inspections or identifying new
properties requiring inspection. In collaboration with AFRD, we developed the
Firebird framework to help municipal fire departments identify and prioritize
commercial property fire inspections, using machine learning, geocoding, and
information visualization. Firebird computes fire risk scores for over 5,000
buildings in the city, with true positive rates of up to 71% in predicting
fires. It has identified 6,096 new potential commercial properties to inspect,
based on AFRD's criteria for inspection. Furthermore, through an interactive
map, Firebird integrates and visualizes fire incidents, property information
and risk scores to help AFRD make informed decisions about fire inspections.
Firebird has already begun to make positive impact at both local and national
levels. It is improving AFRD's inspection processes and Atlanta residents'
safety, and was highlighted by National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) as a
best practice for using data to inform fire inspections."
"We study the response to the Charlie Hebdo shootings of January 7, 2015 on
Twitter across the globe. We ask whether the stances on the issue of freedom of
speech can be modeled using established sociological theories, including
Huntington's culturalist Clash of Civilizations, and those taking into
consideration social context, including Density and Interdependence theories.
We find support for Huntington's culturalist explanation, in that the
established traditions and norms of one's ""civilization"" predetermine some of
one's opinion. However, at an individual level, we also find social context to
play a significant role, with non-Arabs living in Arab countries using
#JeSuisAhmed (""I am Ahmed"") five times more often when they are embedded in a
mixed Arab/non-Arab (mention) network. Among Arabs living in the West, we find
a great variety of responses, not altogether associated with the size of their
expatriate community, suggesting other variables to be at play."
"Today's geo-location estimation approaches are able to infer the location of
a target image using its visual content alone. These approaches exploit visual
matching techniques, applied to a large collection of background images with
known geo-locations. Users who are unaware that visual retrieval approaches can
compromise their geo-privacy, unwittingly open themselves to risks of crime or
other unintended consequences. Private photo sharing is not able to protect
users effectively, since its inconvenience is a barrier to consistent use, and
photos can still fall into the wrong hands if they are re-shared. This paper
lays the groundwork for a new approach to geo-privacy of social images: Instead
of requiring a complete change of user behavior, we investigate the protection
potential latent in users existing practices. We carry out a series of
retrieval experiments using a large collection of social images (8.5M) to
systematically analyze where users should be wary, and how both photo taking
and editing practices impact the performance of geo-location estimation. We
find that practices that are currently widespread are already sufficient to
protect single-handedly the geo-location ('geo-cloak') up to more than 50% of
images whose location would otherwise be automatically predictable. Our
conclusion is that protecting users against the unwanted effects of visual
retrieval is a viable research field, and should take as its starting point
existing user practices."
"As the Internet grows in importance, it is vital to develop methods and
techniques for educating end-users to improve their awareness of online
privacy. Web-based education tools have been proven effective in many domains
and have been increasingly adopted by many online professional and educational
services. However, the design and development of Web-based education tools for
online privacy is still in the early stage. The traditional solutions always
involve privacy experts who have sophisticated expertise. Such involvement can
make the tool development costly. Furthermore, it is not clear how inspiring
and effective these education tools are to general users of varying
backgrounds, specially to novice users who have rarely dealt with online
privacy issues before. In this paper, we design, develop, and evaluate a
game-based privacy learning system by leveraging the wisdom of a crowd of
non-experts on Amazon Mechanic Turk. Empirical study demonstrates that the
crowd can provide high-quality ideas of designing and developing a practical,
educational privacy learning game."
"This study is to examine the role of ICT in the survival of selected SMEs in
Koforidua, Ghana The study employed descriptive technique to conduct the
survey. Using a sample of 100 SMEs, an accidental sampling of a non-probability
technique was used to gathered data and information. The study argues out that
majority of the SMEs operators do use at least one ICT tool in supporting their
operations within the New Juaben Municipality. The study revealed that ICT is
good and helps business survival in difficult times and become competitive in
support of literature r ;eviewed. The study suggested that periodic training in
the form of workshops and sensitization programs on the benefits and the use
ICT resources in business growth strategies should be organized by National
Board for Small-Scale Industries (NBSSI). SME operators, can also outsource
their ICT delivery systems by engaging ICT consultants in order to avoid the
problem of funding relating to the setting up of their own ICT system which
usually requires huge initial capital outlay. The primary policy recommendation
arising out of this is that applications for SMEs need to be developed using
mobile phones."
"The concern over global urbanization trend imposes smart-city as enabling
information and communication technology (ICT) to improve urban governance.
However, the light trance on better living space is stimulated by socioeconomic
impact of escalated senior generation. Hence, ambient assisted living (AAL)
emerges for the autonomous provisioning of pervasive things or objects from
relevant perturbation for advanced scientific instrumentation. Meanwhile,
citizens are observed in being transfixed by lively stimuli of monotonous urban
events with the advent of virtual reality or augmented things. Thus, due to the
involvement of situation-awareness or contextualization,
engagement/participation information as a utility promises to improve urban
experience. However, it is complex to grapple meaningful concepts due to
personalization obstacles, such as citizen psychology, information gap,
service-visualization. Moreover, recommended practices deficit adaptation to
monochromatic choice, disparate impairments, mobility and annotation-richness
in urban space. Hence, rejuvenation of engagement relates to monitoring and
quantification of 'service consumption and graceful degradation' of experience.
However, paramount challenges are imposed on this stipulation, such as,
unobservability, independence and composite relationship of contexts.
Therefore, a parametric Bayesian based model is envisioned to address
observability and scalability of contexts and its conjugal relationship with
engagement. Last but not the least, systematic framework is demonstrated, which
pinpoints key goals of context-aware engagement from participants' opinions,
usages and feed-backs."
"Computational social scientists often harness the Web as a ""societal
observatory"" where data about human social behavior is collected. This data
enables novel investigations of psychological, anthropological and sociological
research questions. However, in the absence of demographic information, such as
gender, many relevant research questions cannot be addressed. To tackle this
problem, researchers often rely on automated methods to infer gender from name
information provided on the web. However, little is known about the accuracy of
existing gender-detection methods and how biased they are against certain
sub-populations. In this paper, we address this question by systematically
comparing several gender detection methods on a random sample of scientists for
whom we know their full name, their gender and the country of their workplace.
We further suggest a novel method that employs web-based image retrieval and
gender recognition in facial images in order to augment name-based approaches.
Our findings show that the performance of name-based gender detection
approaches can be biased towards countries of origin and such biases can be
reduced by combining name-based an image-based gender detection methods."
"Time plays an integral role in the realm of e-learning modules. plaimi
previously described a canvas for composing e-learning modules. By
transitivity, time needs to play an integral role in this canvas. This paper
investigates some of the ways it can play said role. Four angles are
considered: insights offered by viewing a module composition as a chronicle of
modules, the importance of length estimation in time allocation, heightening
retention via spaced repetition, and synchronisation attempts at facilitating
collaborative learning. The features discovered by this investigation are
discussed in a principled learning context, which particularly emphasises
academic learning time. Some concrete suggestions are made; to implement:
order-awareness, user estimation of module length, spaced-repetition-awareness,
and post-module self-assessment. Suggestions for further research are also
given."
"Smart Infusion Pumps are vital tools for use in administering a broad range

complexity, and inevitably a greater likelihood for systems failure and/or
malfunction - this in effect runs contrary to the objective of deploying
clinical informatics solutions such as smart infusion systems, due to their
inherent technical and chronic performance problems as well as error prone
usage that may occasion Recessive(unintended but underlying) Lethal Autonomy.
The Recursive Concurrence protocols suggested in this paper are a means for
reducing if not eliminating the challenging phenomenon of Recessive Lethal
Autonomy in clinical informatics devices and/or systems."
"The data generated by the devices and existing infrastructure in the Internet
of Things (IoT) should be shared among applications. However, data sharing in
the IoT can only reach its full potential when multiple participants contribute
their data, for example when people are able to use their smartphone sensors
for this purpose. We believe that each step, from sensing the data to the
actionable knowledge, requires trust-enabled mechanisms to facilitate data
exchange, such as data perception trust, trustworthy data mining, and reasoning
with trust related policies. The absence of trust could affect the acceptance
of sharing data in smart cities. In this study, we focus on data usage
transparency and accountability and propose a trust model for data sharing in
smart cities, including system architecture for trust-based data sharing, data
semantic and abstraction models, and a mechanism to enhance transparency and
accountability for data usage. We apply semantic technology and defeasible
reasoning with trust data usage policies. We built a prototype based on an air
pollution monitoring use case and utilized it to evaluate the performance of
our solution."
"While motivation is of great interest to computing educators, relatively
little work has been done on understanding faculty attitudes toward student
motivation. Two previous qualitative studies of instructor attitudes found
results identical to those from other disciplines, but neither study considered
whether instructors perceive student motivation to be more important in certain
computing classes. In this work we present quantitative results about the
perceived importance of student motivation in computing courses on the part of
computing educators. Our survey results show that while a majority of
respondents believe student motivation is necessary in all computing courses,
the structure and audience in certain computing classes elevate the importance
of student motivation."
"Science education will play a vital role in shaping the present and future of
modern societies. Thus, Europe needs all its talents to increase creativity and
competitiveness. Young boys and girls especially have to be engaged to pursue
careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). However,
statistics still show that enrolment rates in STEM-based degree programs are
decreasing. This will lead to a workforce problem in the industrial sector as
well as in research and development, especially in many of the new member
countries. This paper highlights a recently funded EU-research project
SciChallenge (www.scichallenge.eu), which focuses on the development of novel
concepts to get young people excited about science education. It uses a
contest-based approach towards self-produced digital education materials from
young people for young people. In cooperation with partner schools, teachers,
and other youth-oriented institutions, the contest participants (individuals or
groups) between the ages of 10 and 20 years generate creative digital materials
(videos, slides, or infographics). The participants upload their content in
social media channels and the submissions are aggregated on the SciChallenge
Web Platform. The winners receive prizes funded by science-oriented industry
and other stakeholders. Intelligent cross-sectoral positioning of various
awareness modules on the SciChallenge Open Information Hub is expected to
increase awareness on science careers. Through a strong involvement of related
organizations and industries, we expect to open new opportunities for young
people in regards to internships or taster days in STEM disciplines.
Additionally, aggregated information on science events (such as, slams, nights,
festivals) is shared. With this multi-level approach, SciChallenge may boost
the attractiveness of science education and careers among young people."
"Cloud computing projects have many implications, including issues such as
security, compliance, funding, cohesion with existing systems, operational
resource requirements, and number of employees involved. In order to gain a
better understanding of why businesses are interested in adopting cloud
services in spite of these potential difficulties, we interviewed senior IT
personnel at five different organizations about their processes related to
cloud decisions, their thoughts before and during the process, and the outcome
of their endeavor. Our results provide insights from their perspectives into
the similarities and differences among the organizations and the implications
of going into the cloud. We conclude with a list of recommended questions and
areas to consider for use by other organizations looking into adopting cloud
services. The ultimate goal is to help businesses considering a cloud computing
project by providing advice from other organizations based on their experience."
"Web technology is one of the key areas in information and communication
technology to be used as a powerful tool in ensuring food security which is one
of the main issues in Sri Lanka. Web technology involves in communicating and
sharing resources in network of computers all over the world. Main focus of
food security is to ensure that all people have fair access to sufficient and
quality food without endangering the future supply of the same food. In this
context, web sites play a vital and major role in achieving food security in
Sri Lanka. In this case study, websites pertaining to Sri Lankan government and
link with food security were analyzed to find out their impact in achieving the
goals of food security using web technologies and how they are being involved
in ensuring food security in Sri Lanka. The other objective of this study is to
make the Sri Lankan government aware of present situation of those websites in
addressing food security related issues and how modern web technologies could
be effectively and efficiently used to address those issues. So, the relevant
websites were checked against several criteria and scores were used to assess
their capabilities to address the concerns of food security. It was found that
the amount of emphasis given by these websites to address the issues of food
security is not satisfactory. Further, it showed that if these web sites could
be improved further, they would generate a powerful impact on ensuring food
security in Sri Lanka."
"Today's cities face many challenges due to population growth, aging
population, pedestrian and vehicular traffic congestion, water usage increase,
increased electricity demands, crumbling physical infrastructure of buildings,
roads, water sewage, power grid, and declining health care services. Moreover,
major trends indicate the global urbanization of society, and the associated
pressures it brings, will continue to accelerate. One of the approaches to
assist in solving some of the challenges is to deploy extensive IT technology.
It has been recognized that cyber-technology plays a key role in improving
quality of people's lives, strengthening business and helping government
agencies serve citizens better. In this white paper, we discuss the benefits
and challenges of cyber-technologies within ""Smart Cities"", especially the IoT
(Internet of Things) for smart communities, which means considering the
benefits and challenges of IoT cyber-technologies on smart cities physical
infrastructures and their human stakeholders. To point out the IoT challenges,
we will first present the framework within which IoT lives, and then proceed
with the challenges, conclusions and recommendations."
"The social networking sites have brought a new horizon for expressing views
and opinions of individuals. Moreover, they provide medium to students to share
their sentiments including struggles and joy during the learning process. Such
informal information has a great venue for decision making. The large and
growing scale of information needs automatic classification techniques.
Sentiment analysis is one of the automated techniques to classify large data.
The existing predictive sentiment analysis techniques are highly used to
classify reviews on E-commerce sites to provide business intelligence. However,
they are not much useful to draw decisions in education system since they
classify the sentiments into merely three preset categories: positive, negative
and neutral. Moreover, classifying the students sentiments into positive or
negative category does not provide deeper insight into their problems and
perks. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Classification Algorithm to
classify engineering students sentiments. Unlike traditional predictive
sentiment analysis techniques, the proposed algorithm makes sentiment analysis
process descriptive. Moreover, it classifies engineering students perks in
addition to problems into several categories to help future students and
education system in decision making."
"This paper presents the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Pervasive
Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM). This
program brings together 11 academic partners and 8 industry partners to combine

motivations for ICT education for sustainability challenges. It then details
the structure and contents of the programs including the courses offered at the
three teaching locations (Nancy France, Lappeenranta Finland, and Lulea
Sweden). The ways that the program has been running as well as students
selection, their thesis works, involvement of industry, are also discussed. The
program was built and managed using a solid academic standards and strategies
student-centered learning."
"Our lives have been immensely improved by decades of automation research --
we are more comfortable, more productive and safer than ever before. Just
imagine a world where familiar automation technologies have failed. In that
world, thermostats don't work -- you have to monitor your home heating system
manually. Cruise control for your car doesn't exist. Every elevator has to have
a human operator to hit the right floor, most manufactured products are
assembled by hand, and you have to wash your own dishes. Who would willingly
adopt that world -- the world of last century -- today? Physical systems --
elevators, cars, home appliances, manufacturing equipment -- were more
troublesome, ore time consuming, less safe, and far less convenient. Now,
suppose we put ourselves in the place someone 20 years in the future, a future
of autonomous systems. A future where transportation is largely autonomous,
more efficient, and far safer; a future where dangerous occupations like mining
or disaster response are performed by autonomous systems supervised remotely by
humans; a future where manufacturing and healthcare are twice as productive per
person-hour by having smart monitoring and readily re-tasked autonomous
physical agents; a future where the elderly and infirm have 24 hour in-home
autonomous support for the basic activities, both physical and social, of daily
life. In a future world where these capabilities are commonplace, why would
someone come back to today's world where someone has to put their life at risk
to do a menial job, we lose time to mindless activities that have no intrinsic
value, or be consumed with worry that a loved one is at risk in their own home?
In what follows, and in a series of associated essays, we expand on these
ideas, and frame both the opportunities and challenges posed by autonomous
physical systems."
"A recent McKinsey report estimates the economic impact of the Internet of
Things (IoT) to be between $3.9 to $11 trillion dollars by 20251 . IoT has the
potential to have a profound impact on our daily lives, including technologies
for the home, for health, for transportation, and for managing our natural
resources. The Internet was largely driven by information and ideas generated
by people, but advances in sensing and hardware have enabled computers to more
easily observe the physical world. Coupling this additional layer of
information with advances in machine learning brings dramatic new capabilities
including the ability to capture and process tremendous amounts of data; to
predict behaviors, activities, and the future in uncanny ways; and to
manipulate the physical world in response. This trend will fundamentally change
how people interact with physical objects and the environment. Success in
developing value-added capabilities around IoT requires a broad approach that
includes expertise in sensing and hardware, machine learning, networked
systems, human-computer interaction, security, and privacy. Strategies for
making IoT practical and spurring its ultimate adoption also require a
multifaceted approach that often transcends technology, such as with concerns
over data security, privacy, public policy, and regulatory issues. In this
paper we argue that existing best practices in building robust and secure
systems are insufficient to address the new challenges that IoT systems will
present. We provide recommendations regarding investments in research areas
that will help address inadequacies in existing systems, practices, tools, and
policies."
"The social conventions and expectations around the appropriate use of imaging
and video has been transformed by the availability of video cameras in our
pockets. The impact on law enforcement can easily be seen by watching the
nightly news; more and more arrests, interventions, or even routine stops are
being caught on cell phones or surveillance video, with both positive and
negative consequences. This proliferation of the use of video has led law
enforcement to look at the potential benefits of incorporating video capture
systematically in their day to day operations. At the same time, recognition of
the inevitability of widespread use of video for police operations has caused a
rush to deploy all types of cameras, including body worn cameras. However, the
vast majority of police agencies have limited experience in utilizing video to
its full advantage, and thus do not have the capability to fully realize the
value of expanding their video capabilities. In this white paper, we highlight
some of the technology needs and challenges of body-worn cameras, and we relate
these needs to the relevant state of the art in computer vision and multimedia
research. We conclude with a set of recommendations."
"Great advances in computing and communication technology are bringing many
benefits to society, with transformative changes and financial opportunities
being created in health care, transportation, education, law enforcement,
national security, commerce, and social interactions. Many of these benefits,
however, involve the use of sensitive personal data, and thereby raise concerns
about privacy. Failure to address these concerns can lead to a loss of trust in
the private and public institutions that handle personal data, and can stifle
the independent thought and expression that is needed for our democracy to
flourish.
  This report, sponsored by the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), suggests
a roadmap for privacy research over the next decade, aimed at enabling society
to appropriately control threats to privacy while enjoying the benefits of
information technology and data science. We hope that it will be useful to the
agencies of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and
Development (NITRD) Program as they develop a joint National Privacy Research
Strategy over the coming months. The report synthesizes input drawn from the
privacy and computing communities submitted to both the CCC and NITRD, as well
as past reports on the topic."
