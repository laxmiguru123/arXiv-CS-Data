summary
"This paper presents a novel methodology to develop scheduling algorithms. The
scheduling problem is phrased as a control problem, and control-theoretical
techniques are used to design a scheduling algorithm that meets specific
requirements. Unlike most approaches to feedback scheduling, where a controller
integrates a ""basic"" scheduling algorithm and dynamically tunes its parameters
and hence its performances, our methodology essentially reduces the design of a
scheduling algorithm to the synthesis of a controller that closes the feedback
loop. This approach allows the re-use of control-theoretical techniques to
design efficient scheduling algorithms; it frames and solves the scheduling
problem in a general setting; and it can naturally tackle certain peculiar
requirements such as robustness and dynamic performance tuning. A few
experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on a real-time
benchmark."
"This work focuses on the convergence analysis of adaptive distributed
beamforming schemes that can be reformulated as local random search algorithms
via a random search framework. Once reformulated as local random search
algorithms, it is proved that under two sufficient conditions: a) the objective
function of the algorithm is continuous and all its local maxima are global
maxima, and b) the origin is an interior point within the range of the
considered transformation of the random perturbation, the corresponding
adaptive distributed beamforming schemes converge both in probability and in
mean. This proof of convergence is general since it can be applied to analyze
randomized adaptive distributed beamforming schemes with any type of objective
functions and probability measures as long as both the sufficient conditions
are satisfied. Further, this framework can be generalized to analyze an
asynchronous scheme where distributed transmitters can only update their
beamforming coefficients asynchronously. Simulation results are also provided
to validate our analyses."
"Periodic nonuniform sampling has been considered in literature as an
effective approach to reduce the sampling rate far below the Nyquist rate for
sparse spectrum multiband signals. In the presence of non-ideality the sampling
parameters play an important role on the quality of reconstructed signal. Also
the average sampling ratio is directly dependent on the sampling parameters
that they should be chosen for a minimum rate and complexity. In this paper we
consider the effect of sampling parameters on the reconstruction error and the
sampling ratio and suggest feasible approaches for achieving an optimal
sampling and reconstruction."
"Liouvillian systems were initially introduced within the framework of
differential algebra. They can be seen as a natural extension of differential
flat systems. Many physical non flat systems seem to be Liouvillian. We present
in this paper an alternative definition to this class of systems using the
language of diffieties and infinite prolongation theory."
"This paper proposes a new approach to multisensor data fusion, suggesting by
considering information about the sensors' different characteristics,
aggregation of data acquired by individual sensors can be done more efficient.
Same as the most effective sensors' characteristics, especially in control
systems, our focus is on sensors' accuracy and frequency response. A rule-based
fuzzy system is presented for fusion of raw data obtained from the sensors
having complement characteristics in accuracy and bandwidth. Furthermore, a
fuzzy predictor system is also suggested aiming to extremely high accuracy for
highly sensitive applications. The great advantages of the proposed sensor
fusion system are revealed on simulation results of a control system utilizing
the fusion system for output estimation."
"Bisimulation relation has been successfully applied to computer science and
control theory. In our previous work, simulation-based controllability and
simulation-based observability are proposed, under which the existence of
bisimilarity supervisor is guaranteed. However, a given specification automaton
may not satisfy these conditions, and a natural question is how to compute a
maximum permissive subspecification. This paper aims to answer this question
and investigate the computation of the supremal simulation-based controllable
and strong observable subautomata with respect to given specifications by the
lattice theory. In order to achieve the supremal solution, three monotone
operators, namely simulation operator, controllable operator and strong
observable operator, are proposed upon the established complete lattice. Then,
inequalities based on these operators are formulated, whose solution is the
simulation-based controllable and strong observable set. In particular, a
sufficient condition is presented to guarantee the existence of the supremal
simulation-based controllable and strong observable subautomata. Furthermore,
an algorithm is proposed to compute such subautomata."
"The concave utility in the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem is only
suitable for elastic flows. However, the networks with the multiclass traffic,
the utility of inelastic traffic is usually represented by the sigmoidal
function which is a nonconcave function. Hence, the basic NUM problem becomes a
nonconvex optimization problem. Solving the nonconvex NUM distributively is a
difficult problem. The current works utilize the standard dual-based algorithm
for the convex NUM and find the criteria for the global optimal convergence of
the algorithm. It turns out that the link capacity must higher than a certain
value to achieve the global optimum.
  We propose a new distributed algorithm that converges to the suboptimal
solution of the nonconvex NUM for all of link capacity. We approximate the
logarithm of the original problem to the convex problem which is solved
efficiently by the standard dual-base distributed algorithm. After a sequence
of approximations, the solutions converge to the KKT solution of the original
problem. In many of our experiments, it also converges to the global optimal
solution of the NUM. Moreover, we extend our work to solve the joint rate and
power NUM problem with elastic and inelastic traffic in a wireless network. Our
techniques can be applied to any log-concave utilities."
"Present work proposes a theoretical statistical model of the downlink power
consumption in cellular CDMA networks. The proposed model employs a simple but
popular propagation model, which breaks down path losses into a distance
dependent and a log-normal shadowing loss term. Based on the aforementioned
path loss formalism, closed-form expressions for the first and the second
moment of power consumption are obtained taking into account conditions placed
by cell selection and handoff algorithms. Numerical results for various radio
propagation environments and cell selection as well as handoff schemes are
provided and discussed."
"Railway grade crossing is become the major headache for the transportation
system. This paper describes an intelligent railway crossing control system for
multiple tracks that features a controller which receives messages from
incoming and outgoing trains by sensors. These messages contain detail
information including the direction and identity of a train. Depending on those
messages the controller device decides whenever the railroad crossing gate will
close or open."
"This paper focusses on the application of fuzzy control techniques (fuzzy
type-1 and type-2) and their hybrid forms (Hybrid adaptive fuzzy controller and
fuzzy-PID controller) in the area of stabilized platforms. It represents an
attempt to cover the basic principles and concepts of fuzzy control in
stabilization and position control, with an outline of a number of recent
applications used in advanced control of stabilized platform. Overall, in this
survey we will make some comparisons with the classical control techniques such
us PID control to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the
application of fuzzy control techniques."
"It is important to implement safe smart grid environment to enhance people's
lives and livelihoods. This paper provides information on smart grid IS
functional requirement by illustrating some discussion points to the sixteen
identified requirements. This paper introduces the smart grid potential hazards
that can be referred as a triggering factor to improve the system and security
of the entire grid. The background of smart information infrastructure and the
needs for smart grid IS is described with the adoption of hermeneutic circle as
methodology. Grid information technology and security-s session discusses that
grid provides the chance of a simple and transparent access to different
information sources. In addition, the transformation between traditional versus
smart grid networking trend and the IS importance on the communication field
reflects the criticality of grid IS functional requirement identification is
introduces. The smart grid IS functional requirements described in this paper
are general and can be adopted or modified to suit any smart grid system. This
paper has tutorial contents where some related backgrounds were provided,
especially for networking community, covering the cyber security requirement of
smart grid information infrastructure."
"The paper describes results on two components of a research program focused
on motion-based communication mediated by the dynamics of a control system.
Specifically we are interested in how mobile agents engaged in a shared
activity such as dance can use motion as a medium for transmitting certain
types of messages. The first part of the paper adopts the terminology of motion
description languages and deconstructs an elementary form of the well-known
popular dance, Salsa, in terms of four motion primitives (dance steps). Several
notions of dance complexity are introduced. We describe an experiment in which
ten performances by an actual pair of dancers are evaluated by judges and then
compared in terms of proposed complexity metrics. An energy metric is also
defined. Values of this metric are obtained by summing the lengths of motion
segments executed by wheeled robots replicating the movements of the human
dancers in each of the ten dance performances. Of all the metrics that are
considered in this experiment, energy is the most closely correlated with the
human judges' assessments of performance quality.
  The second part of the paper poses a general class of dual objective motion
control problems in which a primary objective (artistic execution of a dance
step or efficient movement toward a specified terminal state) is combined with
a communication objective. Solutions of varying degrees of explicitness can be
given in several classes of problems of communicating through the dynamics of
finite dimensional linear control systems. In this setting it is shown that the
cost of adding a communication component to motions that steer a system between
prescribed pairs of states is independent of those states. At the same time,
the optimal encoding problem itself is shown to be a problem of packing
geometric objects, and it remains open."
"In this paper, the l1 norm penalty on the filter coefficients is incorporated
in the least mean absolute deviation (LAD) algorithm to improve the performance
of the LAD algorithm. The performance of LAD, zero-attracting LAD (ZA-LAD) and
reweighted zero-attracting LAD (RZA-LAD) are evaluated for linear time varying
system identification under the non-Gaussian (alpha-stable) noise environments.
Effectiveness of the ZA-LAD type algorithms is demonstrated through computer
simulations."
"One of the most important challenges in the integration of renewable energy
sources into the power grid lies in their `intermittent' nature. The power
output of sources like wind and solar varies with time and location due to
factors that cannot be controlled by the provider. Two strategies have been
proposed to hedge against this variability: 1) use energy storage systems to
effectively average the produced power over time; 2) exploit distributed
generation to effectively average production over location. We introduce a
network model to study the optimal use of storage and transmission resources in
the presence of random energy sources. We propose a Linear-Quadratic based
methodology to design control strategies, and we show that these strategies are
asymptotically optimal for some simple network topologies. For these
topologies, the dependence of optimal performance on storage and transmission
capacity is explicitly quantified."
"This paper reports on a study that helps visually-impaired people to walk
more confidently. The study hypothesizes that a smart cane that alerts
visually-impaired people over obstacles in front could help them in walking
with less accident. The aim of the paper is to address the development work of
a cane that could communicate with the users through voice alert and vibration,
which is named Smart Cane. T he development work involves coding and physical
installation. A series of tests have been carried out on the smart cane and the
results are discussed. This study found that the Smart Cane functions well as
intended, in alerting users about the obstacles in front"
"In this paper we introduce paraglide, a visualization system designed for
interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multi-variate simulation models.
To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to
go back and forth between setting parameters and qualitatively judging the
outcomes of their model. During this process, they build up a grounded
understanding of the parameter effects in order to pick the right setting.
Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a
systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions
about parameter settings a tedious and workload-intensive task. Paraglide
endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by assisting the sampling of the
parameter space and the discovery of qualitatively different model outcomes.
This results in a decomposition of the model parameter space into regions of
distinct behaviour. We developed paraglide in close collaboration with experts
from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models
for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and
derived a set of design requirements, then engaged in a longitudinal
user-centered design process, and finally conducted three in-depth case studies
underlining the usefulness of our approach."
"In this paper, a fuzzy controller type Takagi_Sugeno zero order is optimized
by the method of hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS).
The algorithm automatically adjusts the membership functions of fuzzy
controller inputs and the conclusions of fuzzy rules. At each iteration of PSO,
we calculate the best solution and we seek the best neighbor by Tabu search,
this operation minimizes the number of iterations and computation time while
maintaining accuracy and minimum response time. We apply this algorithm to
optimize a fuzzy controller for a simple inverted pendulum with three rules."
"In decentralized systems, branching behaviors naturally arise due to
communication, unmodeled dynamics and system abstraction, which can not be
adequately captured by the traditional sequencing-based language equivalence.
As a finer behavior equivalence than language equivalence, bisimulation not
only allows the full set of branching behaviors but also explicitly specifies
the properties in terms of temporal logic such as CTL* and mu-calculus. This
observation motivates us to consider the decentralized control of discrete
event systems (DESs) for bisimulation equivalence in this paper, where the
plant and the specification are taken to be nondeterministic and the supervisor
is taken to be deterministic. An automata-based control framework is
formalized, upon which we develop three architectures with respect to different
decision fusion rules for the decentralized bisimilarity control, named a
conjunctive architecture, a disjunctive architecture and a general
architecture. Under theses three architectures, necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of decentralized bisimilarity supervisors are
derived respectively, which extend the traditional results of supervisory
control from language equivalence to bisimulation equivalence. It is shown that
these conditions can be verified with exponential complexity. Furthermore, the
synthesis of bisimilarity supervisors is presented when the existence condition
holds."
"The output of renewable energy fluctuates significantly depending on weather
conditions. We develop a unit commitment model to analyze requirements of the
forecast output and its error for renewable energies. Our model obtains the
time series for the operational state of thermal power plants that would
maximize the profits of an electric power utility by taking into account both
the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response
of consumers. We consider a power system consisting of thermal power plants,
photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the
forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the
operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden
decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be
operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The
increase in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period
does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the
substitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not
expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the
case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the
number of operating thermal power plants is reduced by the demand response. A
power utility has to continue thermal power plants for ensuring supply-demand
balance; some of these plants can be decommissioned after installing a large
number of wind farms or PV systems, if the demand response is applied using an
appropriate price structure."
"The ongoing evolution of the electric power systems brings about the need to
cope with increasingly complex interactions of technical components and
relevant actors. In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of
different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include
time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach
combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte
Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical components such as
generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid
operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability
indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the influence
of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability
can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by
performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model
of the Swiss high-voltage grid."
"Recent papers have treated {\em control communication complexity} in the
context of information-based, multiple agent control systems including
nonlinear systems of the type that have been studied in connection with quantum
information processing. The present paper continues this line of investigation
into a class of two-agent distributed control systems in which the agents
cooperate in order to realize common goals that are determined via independent
actions undertaken individually by the agents. A basic assumption is that the
actions taken are unknown in advance to the other agent. These goals can be
conveniently summarized in the form of a {\em target matrix}, whose entries are
computed by the control system responding to the choices of inputs made by the
two agents. We show how to realize such target matrices for a broad class of
systems that possess an input-output mapping that is bilinear. One can classify
control-communication strategies, known as {\em control protocols}, according
to the amount of information sharing occurring between the two agents.
Protocols that assume no information sharing on the inputs that each agent
selects and protocols that allow sufficient information sharing for identifying
the common goals are the two extreme cases. Control protocols will also be
evaluated and compared in terms of cost functionals given by integrated
quadratic functions of the control inputs. The minimal control cost of the two
classes of control protocols are analyzed and compared. The difference in the
control costs between the two classes reflects an inherent trade-off between
communication complexity and control cost."
"For a closed-loop system, which has a contention-based multiple access
network on its sensor link, the Medium Access Controller (MAC) may discard some
packets when the traffic on the link is high. We use a local state-based
scheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this
paper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in
the presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based
scheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to
find. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find
that certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical
result of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a
certainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an
equivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen.
Computing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a
symmetry constraint on the scheduler. Based on these findings, we propose a
dual predictor architecture for the closed-loop system, which ensures
separation between scheduler, observer and controller. We present an example of
this architecture, which illustrates a network-aware event-triggering
mechanism."
"Networked control systems (NCS) are spatially distributed systems where
communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a
shared communication network. NCS have been studied for the last ten years and
important research results have been obtained. These results are in the area of
stability and stabilizability. However, while important, these results must be
complemented in different areas to be able to design effective NCS. In this
paper we approach the control design of NCS using symbolic (finite) models.
Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one
symbol corresponds to an ""aggregate"" of continuous states. We consider a fairly
general multiple-loop network architecture where plants communicate with
digital controllers through a shared, non-ideal, communication network
characterized by variable sampling and transmission intervals, variable
communication delays, quantization errors, packet losses and limited bandwidth.
We first derive a procedure to obtain symbolic models that are proven to
approximate NCS in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation. We then
use these symbolic models to design symbolic controllers that realize
specifications expressed in terms of automata on infinite strings. An example
is provided where we address the control design of a pair of nonlinear control
systems sharing a common communication network. The closed-loop NCS obtained is
validated through the OMNeT++ network simulation framework."
"This paper presents an input-output simulation approach to controlling
multi-affine systems for linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications, which
consists of the following steps. First, we partition the state space into
rectangles, each of which satisfies atomic LTL propositions. Then, we study the
control of multi-affine systems on rectangles including the control of driving
all trajectories starting from a rectangle to exit through a facet and the
control of stabilizing the system towards a desired point. With the proposed
controllers, a finitely abstracted transition system is constructed which is
shown to be input-output simulated by the rectangular transition system of the
multi-affine system. Since input-output simulation preserves LTL properties,
the controller synthesis of the multi-affine system for LTL specifications is
achieved by designing a nonblocking supervisor for the abstracted transition
system and by continuously implementing the resulting supervisor for the
original multi-affine system."
"This paper investigates the supervisory control of nondeterministic discrete
event systems to enforce bisimilarity with respect to deterministic
specifications. A notion of synchronous simulation-based controllability is
introduced as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
bisimilarity enforcing supervisor, and a polynomial algorithm is developed to
verify such a condition. When the existence condition holds, a supervisor
achieving bisimulation equivalence is constructed. Furthermore, when the
existence condition does not hold, two different methods are provided for
synthesizing maximal permissive sub-specifications."
"The remotely sensed data from an unknown location is transmitted in real time
through internet and gathered in a PC. The data is collected for a considerable
period of time and analyzed in PC as to assess the suitability and fertility of
the land for establishing an electronic plantation in that area. The analysis
also helps deciding the plantation of appropriate plants in the location
identified. The system performing this task with appropriate transducers
installed in remote area, the methodologies involved in transmission and data
gathering are reported.. The second part of the project deals with data
gathering from remote site and issuing control signals to remote appliances in
the site; all performed through internet. Therefore, this control scheme is a
duplex system monitoring the irrigation activities by collecting data in one
direction and issuing commands on the opposite direction. This scheme maintains
the digital irrigation systems effectively and efficiently as to utilize the
resources optimally for yielding enhanced production. The methodologies
involved in extending the two way communication of data are presented."
"Pneumatic pressure cells with thin metallic spherical diaphragm of shallow
spherical shell configuration linked with vibrating wire pickup or vibrating
cantilever pickup were reported in the past. In order to enhance the
sensitivity of the pressure cell this work considers dual diaphragm structure
fitted with cantilever pickup. The design and development of the pressure cell
with this dual diaphragm structure having cantilever pickup is presented here.
The geometrical design is optimally made as to sense either mono pressure or
differential pressure resources. The cantilevers of the two diaphragms are
excited to produce vibrations and the frequencies of vibrations are determined
by picking up signals from orthogonally arranged opto-coupler links. With the
computed frequency a lookup table is referred to obtain the pressure acting on
the concerned diaphragm. In the external circuits, the average pressure and the
differential pressure acting on two diaphragms are computed. Furthermore
transmitting circuits taking the average pressure and differential pressure in
digital form and analogue form to remote area are presented. Performance
analysis of the proposed mechatronic pressure cell is made and its improved
performance over other pressure cells is presented."
"Thin metallic shallow spherical diaphragms are being used for measuring
pneumatic pressure in process industries. The drift in vertex realized due to
application of pressure is transformed into electrical signal and this is
calibrated for pressure. We now propose a modified structure for the pressure
cell by having double ended shallow spherical shells embedded with spherical
corrugations as to enhance the sensitivity to a greater extent. By having dual
such installation in the structure of the pressure cell it concedes further
increase in sensitivity. The construction details of the diaphragm structure,
theory and analysis to assess the performance are presented."
"We study the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems for general
network topologies with unidirectional information flow. We propose two
(linear) distributed algorithms, deterministic and gossip, respectively for the
cases where the inter-agent communication is synchronous and asynchronous. Our
contribution is that in both cases, the developed algorithms guarantee state
averaging on arbitrary strongly connected digraphs; in particular, this
graphical condition does not require that the network be balanced or symmetric,
thereby extending many previous results in the literature. The key novelty of
our approach is to augment an additional variable for each agent, called
""surplus"", whose function is to locally record individual state updates. For
convergence analysis, we employ graph-theoretic and nonnegative matrix tools,
with the eigenvalue perturbation theory playing a crucial role."
"There is evidence that flying animals such as pigeons, goshawks, and bats use
optical flow sensing to enable high-speed flight through forest clutter. This
paper discusses the elements of a theory of controlled flight through obstacle
fields in which motion control laws are based on optical flow sensing.
Performance comparison is made with feedback laws that use distance and bearing
measurements, and practical challenges of implementation on an actual robotic
air vehicle are described. The related question of fundamental performance
limits due to clutter density is addressed."
"We propose a receding horizon control strategy that readily handles systems
that exhibit interval-wise total energy constraints on the input control
sequence. The approach is based on a variable optimization horizon length and
contractive final state constraint sets. The optimization horizon, which
recedes by N steps every N steps, is the key to accommodate the interval-wise
total energy constraints. The varying optimization horizon along with the
contractive constraints are used to achieve analytic asymptotic stability of
the system under the proposed scheme. The strategy is demonstrated by
simulation examples."
"In this correspondence, we introduce a minimax regret criteria to the least
squares problems with bounded data uncertainties and solve it using
semi-definite programming. We investigate a robust minimax least squares
approach that minimizes a worst case difference regret. The regret is defined
as the difference between a squared data error and the smallest attainable
squared data error of a least squares estimator. We then propose a robust
regularized least squares approach to the regularized least squares problem
under data uncertainties by using a similar framework. We show that both
unstructured and structured robust least squares problems and robust
regularized least squares problem can be put in certain semi-definite
programming forms. Through several simulations, we demonstrate the merits of
the proposed algorithms with respect to the the well-known alternatives in the
literature."
"Formulations of the turbo equalization approach to iterative equalization and
decoding vary greatly when channel knowledge is either partially or completely
unknown. Maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean square error
(MMSE) approaches leverage channel knowledge to make explicit use of soft
information (priors over the transmitted data bits) in a manner that is
distinctly nonlinear, appearing either in a trellis formulation (MAP) or inside
an inverted matrix (MMSE). To date, nearly all adaptive turbo equalization
methods either estimate the channel or use a direct adaptation equalizer in
which estimates of the transmitted data are formed from an expressly linear
function of the received data and soft information, with this latter
formulation being most common. We study a class of direct adaptation turbo
equalizers that are both adaptive and nonlinear functions of the soft
information from the decoder. We introduce piecewise linear models based on
context trees that can adaptively approximate the nonlinear dependence of the
equalizer on the soft information such that it can choose both the partition
regions as well as the locally linear equalizer coefficients in each region
independently, with computational complexity that remains of the order of a
traditional direct adaptive linear equalizer. This approach is guaranteed to
asymptotically achieve the performance of the best piecewise linear equalizer
and we quantify the MSE performance of the resulting algorithm and the
convergence of its MSE to that of the linear minimum MSE estimator as the depth
of the context tree and the data length increase."
"We introduce a low complexity approach to iterative equalization and
decoding, or ""turbo equalization"", that uses clustered models to better match
the nonlinear relationship that exists between likelihood information from a
channel decoder and the symbol estimates that arise in soft-input channel
equalization. The introduced clustered turbo equalizer uses piecewise linear
models to capture the nonlinear dependency of the linear minimum mean square
error (MMSE) symbol estimate on the symbol likelihoods produced by the channel
decoder and maintains a computational complexity that is only linear in the
channel memory. By partitioning the space of likelihood information from the
decoder, based on either hard or soft clustering, and using locally-linear
adaptive equalizers within each clustered region, the performance gap between
the linear MMSE equalizer and low-complexity, LMS-based linear turbo equalizers
can be dramatically narrowed."
"We introduce a new analysis of an adaptive mixture method that combines
outputs of two constituent filters running in parallel to model an unknown
desired signal. This adaptive mixture is shown to achieve the mean square error
(MSE) performance of the best constituent filter, and in some cases outperforms
both, in the steady-state. However, the MSE analysis of this mixture in the
steady-state and during the transient regions uses approximations and relies on
statistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an
analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real life
systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and, in many
cases, that are even chaotic. To this end, we perform the transient and the
steady-state analysis of this adaptive mixture in a ""strong"" deterministic
sense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions
on the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. In
particular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this
adaptive mixture at any time to the time-accumulated squared estimation error
of the optimal convex mixture of the constituent filters directly tuned to the
underlying signal in an individual sequence manner."
"In this paper, we study the problem of identifying the impulse response of a
linear time invariant (LTI) dynamical system from the knowledge of the input
signal and a finite set of noisy output observations. We adopt an approach
based on regularization in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) that takes
into account both continuous and discrete time systems. The focus of the paper
is on designing spaces that are well suited for temporal impulse response
modeling. To this end, we construct and characterize general families of
kernels that incorporate system properties such as stability, relative degree,
absence of oscillatory behavior, smoothness, or delay. In addition, we discuss
the possibility of automatically searching over these classes by means of
kernel learning techniques, so as to capture different modes of the system to
be identified."
"This work proposes to put up a tool for diagnosing multi faults based on
model using techniques of detection and localization inspired from the
community of artificial intelligence and that of automatic. The diagnostic
procedure to be integrated into the supervisory system must therefore be
provided with explanatory features. Techniques based on causal reasoning are a
pertinent approach for this purpose. Bond graph modeling is used to describe
the cause effect relationship between process variables. Experimental results
are presented and discussed in order to compare performance of causal graph
technique and classic methods inspired from artificial intelligence (DX) and
control theory (FDI)."
"Fault detection methods have their pros and cons. Thus, it is possible that
some methods can complement each other and offer consequently better diagnostic
systems. The integration of various characteristics is a way to develop
""hybrid"" systems to overcome the limitations of individual strategies of each
method. In this paper a novel detection module combining the use of adaptive
threshold and fuzzy logic reasoning inspired by the Evsukoff's approach is
proposed in order to reduce the rate of false alarms, guarantee more robustness
to disturbances and assist the operator in making decisions. The proposed
approach can be used in case of multiple faults detection. This approach is
applied to a benchmark in diagnosis domain: the three-tank system. The results
of the proposed detection module are then presented through a gradual palette
of colors in the graphical interface of the system."
"In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling a dynamical system such
that its trajectories satisfy a temporal logic property in a given amount of
time. We focus on multi-affine systems and specifications given as
syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic formulas over rectangular regions
in the state space. The proposed algorithm is based on the estimation of time
bounds for facet reachability problems and solving a time optimal reachability
problem on the product between a weighted transition system and an automaton
that enforces the satisfaction of the specification. A random optimization
algorithm is used to iteratively improve the solution."
"In the article the problem of output setpoint tracking for affine non-linear
system is considered. Presented approach combines state feedback linearization
and homotopy numerical continuation in subspaces of phase space where feedback
linearization fails. The method of numerical parameter continuation for solving
systems of nonlinear equations is generalized to control affine non-linear
dynamical systems. The illustrative example of control of MIMO system which is
not static feedback linearizable is given. Application of proposed method
demonstrated on the speed and rotor magnetic flux control in the three-phase
asynchronous motor."
"The problem of optimal control of power distribution systems is becoming
increasingly compelling due to the progressive penetration of distributed
energy resources in this specific layer of the electrical infrastructure.
Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes in terms of
operation philosophies that are often based on optimal control strategies
relying on the computation of linearized dependencies between controlled (e.g.
voltages, frequency in case of islanding operation) and control variables (e.g.
power injections, transformers tap positions). As the implementation of these
strategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the
derivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables
becomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and
power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of
node voltage and line current flows as a function of the nodal power injections
and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented
in the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the [Y]
compound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to
estimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant
improvements are also quantified versus traditional methods. The validation of
the proposed method is carried out by using both IEEE 13 and 34 node test
feeders. The paper finally shows the use of the proposed method for the problem
of optimal voltage control applied to the IEEE 34 node test feeder."
"In this paper, we propose a two-timescale delay-optimal base station
Discontinuous Transmission (BS-DTX) control and user scheduling for downlink
coordinated MIMO systems with energy harvesting capability. To reduce the
complexity and signaling overhead in practical systems, the BS-DTX control is
adaptive to both the energy state information (ESI) and the data queue state
information (QSI) over a longer timescale. The user scheduling is adaptive to
the ESI, the QSI and the channel state information (CSI) over a shorter
timescale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control problem can be
modeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed Markov Decision
Problem (POMDP), which is well-known to be a difficult problem in general. By
using sample-path analysis and exploiting specific problem structure, we first
obtain some structural results on the optimal control policy and derive an
equivalent Bellman equation with reduced state space. To reduce the complexity
and facilitate distributed implementation, we obtain a delay-aware distributed
solution with the BS-DTX control at the BS controller (BSC) and the user
scheduling at each cluster manager (CM) using approximate dynamic programming
and distributed stochastic learning. We show that the proposed distributed
two-timescale algorithm converges almost surely. Furthermore, using queueing
theory, stochastic geometry and optimization techniques, we derive sufficient
conditions for the data queues to be stable in the coordinated MIMO network and
discuss various design insights."
"The aim of this review paper is to bring into light a potential area i.e.,
web services supply chains for research by analyzing the existing state of art
in this. It is observed from the review process that there seems to be much
less work done in the area of web service supply chains as compared to
e-commerce and product oriented service supply chains. The service quality
assurance models, end to end Quality of Service (QoS) models, attempts made to
QoS attributes are also found to be from individual perspectives of
participating entities in a service process rather than a collective
perspective considering individual QoS attributes rather than multiple QoS
attributes. In light of these gaps we highlight the comparison between product
oriented and pure online/ web service supply chains, a need for quality driven
optimization in the web services supply chains, perceived complexities in the
existing work and propose a conceptual model."
"The photovoltaic sun tracker allows us to increase the energy production. The
sun tracker considered in this study has two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) and
especially specified by the lack of sensors. In this way, the tracker will have
as a set point the sun position at every second during the day for a period of
five years. After sunset, the tracker goes back to the initial position (which
of sunrise). The sliding mode control (SMC) will be applied to ensure at best
the tracking mechanism and, in another hand, the sliding mode observer will
replace the velocity sensor which suffers from a lot of measurement
disturbances. Experimental measurements show that this autonomic dual axis Sun
Tracker increases the power production by over 40%."
"We address the traffic light control problem for multiple intersections in
tandem by viewing it as a stochastic hybrid system and developing a Stochastic
Flow Model (SFM) for it. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we
derive on-line gradient estimates of a cost metric with respect to the
controllable green and red cycle lengths. The IPA estimators obtained require
counting traffic light switchings and estimating car flow rates only when
specific events occur. The estimators are used to iteratively adjust light
cycle lengths to improve performance and, in conjunction with a standard
gradient-based algorithm, to obtain optimal values which adapt to changing
traffic conditions. Simulation results are included to illustrate the approach."
"This paper investigates vision-based cooperative estimation of a 3D target
object pose for visual sensor networks. In our previous works, we presented an
estimation mechanism called networked visual motion observer achieving
averaging of local pose estimates in real time. This paper extends the
mechanism so that it works even in the presence of cameras not viewing the
target due to the limited view angles and obstructions in order to fully take
advantage of the networked vision system. Then, we analyze the averaging
performance attained by the proposed mechanism and clarify a relation between
the feedback gains in the algorithm and the performance. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through simulation."
"We consider the joint estimation of multipath channels obtained with a set of
receiving antennas and uniformly probed in the frequency domain. This scenario
fits most of the modern outdoor communication protocols for mobile access or
digital broadcasting among others.
  Such channels verify a Sparse Common Support property (SCS) which was used in
a previous paper to propose a Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) based sampling
and estimation algorithm. In this contribution we improve the robustness and
computational complexity aspects of this algorithm. The method is based on
projection in Krylov subspaces to improve complexity and a new criterion called
the Partial Effective Rank (PER) to estimate the level of sparsity to gain
robustness.
  If P antennas measure a K-multipath channel with N uniformly sampled
measurements per channel, the algorithm possesses an O(KPNlogN) complexity and
an O(KPN) memory footprint instead of O(PN^3) and O(PN^2) for the direct
implementation, making it suitable for K << N. The sparsity is estimated online
based on the PER, and the algorithm therefore has a sense of introspection
being able to relinquish sparsity if it is lacking. The estimation performances
are tested on field measurements with synthetic AWGN, and the proposed
algorithm outperforms non-sparse reconstruction in the medium to low SNR range
(< 0dB), increasing the rate of successful symbol decodings by 1/10th in
average, and 1/3rd in the best case. The experiments also show that the
algorithm does not perform worse than a non-sparse estimation algorithm in
non-sparse operating conditions, since it may fall-back to it if the PER
criterion does not detect a sufficient level of sparsity.
  The algorithm is also tested against a method assuming a ""discrete"" sparsity
model as in Compressed Sensing (CS). The conducted test indicates a trade-off
between speed and accuracy."
"This paper proposes a framework for automatic development of control systems
from a high level specification based in Grafcet formalism. Grafcet, or
Sequential Function Charts (SFC), is a special class of Petri Nets and is
becoming the standard representation for sequential control systems. The
proposed framework accepts a graphical (through ISaGRAPH) or textual
behavioural specification of the control system to be implemented. It follows
the usual procedure in software specification: the first step is to formally
validate the initial specification. Then the initial specification is
translated through automated processes into an implementation. At the moment
there are two possible output languages: C and Palasm [1]. The target processor
for the C code language are microcontroller based systems that require extended
time constrains and access to external peripherals. The goal of including PLD's
is the possibility of automatically design mixed hardware and software systems."
"This paper develops a controller synthesis method for distributed LQG control
problems under output-feedback. We consider a system consisting of three
interconnected linear subsystems with a delayed information sharing structure.
While the state-feedback case has previously been solved, the extension to
output-feedback is nontrivial as the classical separation principle fails. To
find the optimal solution, the controller is decomposed into two independent
components: a centralized LQG-optimal controller under delayed state
observations, and a sum of correction terms based on additional local
information available to decision makers. Explicit discrete-time equations are
derived whose solutions are the gains of the optimal controller."
"In this paper, we analyze the fundamental power-delay tradeoff in
point-to-point OFDM systems under imperfect channel state information quality
and non-ideal circuit power. We consider the dynamic back- pressure (DBP)
algorithm, where the transmitter determines the rate and power control actions
based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSIT) and the queue state
information (QSI). We exploit a general fluid queue dynamics using a continuous
time dynamic equation. Using the sample-path approach and renewal theory, we
decompose the average delay in terms of multiple unfinished works along a
sample path, and derive an upper bound on the average delay under the DBP power
control, which is asymptotically accurate at small delay regime. We show that
despite imperfect CSIT quality and non-ideal circuit power, the average power
(P) of the DBP policy scales with delay (D) as P = O(Dexp(1/D)) at small delay
regime. While the impacts of CSIT quality and circuit power appears as the
coefficients of the scaling law, they may be significant in some operating
regimes."
"One of the biggest challenges for the Computer Science of today can be summed
up by the paradigm ""access to information from $everywhere$ at $anytime$"". This
is especially true for pervasive computing. With the growth of mobile devices
(e.g., smart-phones), on the one hand, and the quick development of the
Internet (this has become the really pervasive network of today), on the other
hand, the development of real-time pervasive applications has broadened. This
paper focuses on the problem of drafting detection in the Ironman triathlons
which causes serious problems for the majority of organizers regarding such
competitions. A concept of drafting detection system in Ironman is based on the
paradigm of pervasive computing. Results of performing a test system show that
this concept can along with further development of computer technologies become
a reality in the near future."
"We consider the problem of maximizing the algebraic connectivity of the
communication graph in a network of mobile robots by moving them into
appropriate positions. We define the Laplacian of the graph as dependent on the
pairwise distance between the robots and we approximate the problem as a
sequence of Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). We propose a distributed solution
consisting of local SDP's which use information only from nearby neighboring
robots. We show that the resulting distributed optimization framework leads to
feasible subproblems and through its repeated execution, the algebraic
connectivity increases monotonically. Moreover, we describe how to adjust the
communication load of the robots based on locally computable measures.
Numerical simulations show the performance of the algorithm with respect to the
centralized solution."
"In this paper we present a decentralized algorithm to estimate the
eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix that encodes the network topology of a
multi-agent system. We consider network topologies modeled by undirected
graphs. The basic idea is to provide a local interaction rule among agents so
that their state trajectory is a linear combination of sinusoids oscillating
only at frequencies function of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. In
this way, the problem of decentralized estimation of the eigenvalues is mapped
into a standard signal processing problem in which the unknowns are the finite
number of frequencies at which the signal oscillates."
"This paper describes the design and implementation of linear controllers with
a switching condition for a nonlinear hot air blower system (HABS) process
trainer PT326. The system is interfaced with a computer through a USB based
data acquisition module and interfacing circuitry. A calibration equation is
implemented through computer in order to convert the amplified output of the
sensor to temperature. Overall plant is nonlinear; therefore, system
identification is performed in three different regions depending upon the plant
input. For these three regions, three linear controllers are designed with
closed-loop system having small rise time, settling time and overshoot.
Switching of controllers is based on regions defined by plant input. In order
to avoid the effect of discontinuity, due to switching of linear controllers,
parameters of all linear controllers are taken closer to each other. Finally,
discretized controllers along with switching condition are implemented for the
plant through computer and practical results are demonstrated."
"This paper deals with the structural analysis problem of dynamic lumped
process high-index DAE models. We consider two methods for index reduction of
such models by differentiation: Pryce's method and the symbolic differential
elimination algorithm rifsimp. Discussion and comparison of these methods are
given via a class of fundamental process simulation examples. In particular,
the efficiency of the Pryce method is illustrated as a function of the number
of tanks in process design."
"A smart grid delivers power around the country and has an intelligent
monitoring system, which not only keeps track of all the energy coming in from
diverse sources but also can detect where energy is needed through a two-way
communication system that collects data about how and when consumers use power.
It is safer in many ways, compared with the current one-directional power
supply system that seems susceptible to either sabotage or natural disasters,
including being more resistant to attack and power outages. In such an
autonomic and advanced-grid environment, investing in a pilot study and knowing
the nation readiness to adopt a smart grid absolves the government of complex
intervention from any failure to bring Japan into the autonomic-grid
environment. This paper looks closely into the concept of the Japanese
government go green effort, the objective of which is to make Japan a leading
nation in environmental and energy sustainability through green innovation,
such as creating a low-carbon society and embracing the natural grid community.
This paper paints a clearer conceptual picture of how Japan smart grid effort
compares with that of the US."
"In this paper we introduce the problem of dynamic pricing of power for
smart-grid networks. This is studied within a network utility maximization
(NUM) framework in a deterministic setting with a single provider, multiple
users and a finite horizon. The provider produces power or buys power in a
(deterministic) spot market, and determines a dynamic price to charge the
users. The users then adjust their demand in response to the time-varying
prices. This is typically categorized as the demand response problem, and we
study a progression of related models by focusing on two aspects: 1) the
characterization of the structure of the optimal dynamic prices in the Smart
Grid and the optimal demand and supply under various interaction with a spot
market; 2) a greedy approach to facilitate the solution process of the
aggregate NUM problem and the optimality gap between the greedy solution and
the optimal one."
"In this paper, a robust nonlinear control scheme is proposed for a nonlinear
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system subject to bounded time varying
uncertainty which satisfies a certain integral quadratic constraint condition.
The scheme develops a robust feedback linarization approach which uses standard
feedback linearization approach to linearize the nominal nonlinear dynamics of
the uncertain nonlinear system and linearizes the nonlinear time varying
uncertainties at an arbitrary point using the mean value theorem. This approach
transforms uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems into an equivalent MIMO linear
uncertain system model with unstructured uncertainty. Finally, a robust minimax
linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design is proposed for the linearized
model. The scheme guarantees the internal stability of the closed loop system
and provides robust performance. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of
this approach, the proposed method is applied to a tracking control problem for
an air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicle (AHFV)."
"Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an emerging learning paradigm for nonlinear
regression problems and has shown its effectiveness in the machine learning
community. An important feature of ELM is that the learning speed is extremely
fast thanks to its random projection preprocessing step. This feature is taken
advantage of in designing an online parameter estimation algorithm for
nonlinear dynamic systems in this paper. The ELM type random projection and a
nonlinear transformation in the hidden layer and a linear output layer is
considered as a generalized model structure for a given nonlinear system and a
parameter update law is constructed based on Lyapunov principles. Simulation
results on a DC motor and Lorentz oscillator show that the proposed algorithm
is stable and has improved performance over the online-learning ELM algorithm."
"In this paper, we present a heuristic procedure for designing a loop material
flow pattern on a given facility layout with the aim of minimizing the total
material handling distances. We present an approximation of the total material
handling costs and greatly drop the required computational time by minimizing
the approximation instead of the original objective function."
"This paper addresses the problem of sequence-based controller design for
Networked Control Systems (NCS), where control inputs and measurements are
transmitted over TCP-like network connections that are subject to stochastic
packet losses and time-varying packet delays. At every time step, the
controller sends a sequence of predicted control inputs to the actuator in
addition to the current control input. In this sequence-based setup, we derive
an optimal solution to the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem and
prove that the separation principle holds. Simulations demonstrate the improved
performance of this optimal controller compared to other sequence-based
approaches."
"Recovery of the initial state of a high-dimensional system can require a
large number of measurements. In this paper, we explain how this burden can be
significantly reduced when randomized measurement operators are employed. Our
work builds upon recent results from Compressive Sensing (CS). In particular,
we make the connection to CS analysis for random block diagonal matrices. By
deriving Concentration of Measure (CoM) inequalities, we show that the
observability matrix satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) (a
sufficient condition for stable recovery of sparse vectors) under certain
conditions on the state transition matrix. For example, we show that if the
state transition matrix is unitary, and if independent, randomly-populated
measurement matrices are employed, then it is possible to uniquely recover a
sparse high-dimensional initial state when the total number of measurements
scales linearly in the sparsity level (the number of non-zero entries) of the
initial state and logarithmically in the state dimension. We further extend our
RIP analysis for scaled unitary and symmetric state transition matrices. We
support our analysis with a case study of a two-dimensional diffusion process."
"In this paper, a unified approach to sequence-based control and estimation of
linear networked systems with multiple sensors is proposed. Time delays and
data losses in the controller-actuator-channel are compensated by sending
sequences of control inputs. The sequence-based design paradigm is further
extended to the sensor-controller-channels without increasing the load of the
network. In this context, we present a recursive solution based on the
Hypothesizing Distributed Kalman Filter (HKF) that is included in the overall
sequence-based controller design."
"This paper presents a new control, namely additive-state-decomposition
dynamic inversion stabilized control, that is used to stabilize a class of
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems subject to nonparametric time-varying
uncertainties with respect to both state and input. By additive state
decomposition and a new definition of output, the considered uncertain system
is transformed into a minimum-phase uncertainty-free system with relative
degree one, in which all uncertainties are lumped into a new disturbance at the
output. Subsequently, dynamic inversion control is applied to reject the lumped
disturbance. Performance analysis of the resulting closed-loop dynamics shows
that the stability can be ensured. Finally, to demonstrate its effectiveness,
the proposed control is applied to two existing problems by numerical
simulation. Furthermore, in order to show its practicability, the proposed
control is also performed on a real quadrotor to stabilize its attitude when
its inertia moment matrix is subject to a large uncertainty."
"In this paper, a new control scheme, called additive state decomposition
based tracking control, is proposed to solve the tracking (rejection) problem
for rotational position of the TORA (a nonlinear nonminimum phase system). By
the additive state decomposition, the tracking (rejection) task for the
considered nonlinear system is decomposed into two independent subtasks: a
tracking (rejection) subtask for a linear time invariant (LTI) system, leaving
a stabilization subtask for a derived nonlinear system. By the decomposition,
the proposed tracking control scheme avoids solving regulation equations and
can tackle the tracking (rejection) problem in the presence of any external
signal (except for the frequencies at +1 or -1) generated by a marginally
stable autonomous LTI system. To demonstrate the effectiveness, numerical
simulation is given."
"The equations of unsymmetrical 2-phase induction motors are established and a
computer representation is developed from these equations. Computer
representation of single phase motors are developed by extension and
modification of the unsymmetrical 2-phase induction motors representation.
These equations of an unsymmetrical 2-phase induction motors are describe the
dynamic performance of equations of unsymmetrical 2-phase induction motors. The
system is simulated to verify its capability such as input phase voltage,
stator and rotor currents, electromagnetic torque and rotor speed. The
performance of an unsymmetrical 2-p"
"This paper is concerned with the stability analysis of continuous-time
switched systems with a random switching signal. The switching signal manifests
its characteristics with that the dwell time in each subsystem consists of a
fixed part and a random part. The stochastic stability of such switched systems
is studied using a Lyapunov approach. A necessary and sufficient condition is
established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The effect of the random
switching signal on system stability is illustrated by a numerical example and
the results coincide with our intuition."
"This paper considers the problem of robust $H_{\infty}$ control using
decentralized state feedback controllers for a class of large-scale systems
with Markov jump parameters. A sufficient condition is developed to design
controllers using local system states and local system operation modes. The
sufficient condition is given in terms of rank constrained linear matrix
inequalities. An illustrative numerical example is given to demonstrate the
developed theory."
"Target tracking using observations from multiple sensors can achieve better
estimation performance than a single sensor. The most famous estimation tool in
target tracking is Kalman filter. There are several mathematical approaches to
combine the observations of multiple sensors by use of Kalman filter. An
important issue in applying a proper approach is computational complexity. In
this paper, four data fusion algorithms based on Kalman filter are considered
including three centralized and one decentralized methods. Using MATLAB,
computational loads of these methods are compared while number of sensors
increases. The results show that inverse covariance method has the best
computational performance if the number of sensors is above 20. For a smaller
number of sensors, other methods, especially group sensors, are more
appropriate.."
"The design of a power buffer to mitigate the negative impact of constant
power loads on voltage stability as well as enhancing ride-through capability
for the loads during upstream voltage disturbances is examined. The power
buffer adjusts its front-end converter control so that the buffer-load
combination would appear as a constant impedance load to the upstream supply
system when depressed voltage occurs. A battery energy-storage back-up source
within the buffer is activated to maintain the load power demand. It is shown
that the buffer performance is affected by the battery state of discharge and
discharge current. Analytical expressions are also derived to relate the
buffer-load ride-through capability with the battery state-of-discharge. The
most onerous buffer-battery condition under which the load-ride through can be
achieved has been identified."
"A Z-source inverter based grid-interface for a variable-speed wind turbine
connected to a permanent magnet synchronous generator is proposed. A control
system is designed to harvest maximum wind energy under varied wind conditions
with the use of a permanent magnet synchronous generator, a diode-rectifier and
a Z-source inverter. Control systems for speed regulation of the generator and
for DC- and AC- sides of the Z-source inverter are implemented. Laboratory
experiments are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed approach."
"We consider approximating distributions within the framework of optimal mass
transport and specialize to the problem of clustering data sets. Distances
between distributions are measured in the Wasserstein metric. The main problem
we consider is that of approximating sample distributions by ones with sparse
support. This provides a new viewpoint to clustering. We propose different
relaxations of a cardinality function which penalizes the size of the support
set. We establish that a certain relaxation provides the tightest convex lower
approximation to the cardinality penalty. We compare the performance of
alternative relaxations on a numerical study on clustering."
"In this paper a novel distributed algorithm for blind macro calibration in
sensor networks based on output synchronization is proposed. The algorithm is
formulated as a set of gradient-type recursions for estimating parameters of
sensor calibration functions, starting from local criteria defined as weighted
sums of mean square differences between the outputs of neighboring sensors. It
is proved, on the basis of an originally developed methodology for treating
higher-order consensus (or output synchronization) schemes, that the algorithm
achieves asymptotic agreement for sensor gains and offsets, in the mean square
sense and with probability one. In the case of additive measurement noise,
additive inter-agent communication noise, and communication outages, a
modification of the original algorithm based on instrumental variables is
proposed. It is proved using stochastic approximation arguments that the
modified algorithm achieves asymptotic consensus for sensor gains and offsets,
in the mean square sense and with probability one. Special attention is paid to
the situation when a subset of sensors in the network remains with fixed
characteristics. Illustrative simulation examples are provided."
"In this paper, the simulation of the disturbance propagation through a large
power system is performed on the WSCC 127 bus test system. The signal frequency
analysis from several parts of the power system is performed by applying the
Wavelet Transform (WT). The results show that this approach provides the system
operators with some useful information regarding the identification of the
power system low-frequency electromechanical oscillations, the identification
of the coherent groups of generators and the insight into the speed retardation
of some parts of the power system. The ability to localize the disturbance is
based on the disturbance propagation through the power system and the
time-frequency analysis performed by using the WT is presented along with
detailed physical interpretation of the used approach."
"This paper considers the leader-follower control problem for a linear
multi-agent system with directed communication topology and linear nonidentical
uncertain coupling subject to integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A
consensus-type control protocol is proposed based on each agent's states
relative to its neighbors and leader's state relative to agents which observe
the leader. A sufficient condition is obtained by overbounding the cost
function. Based on this sufficient condition, a computational algorithm is
introduced to minimize the proposed guaranteed bound on tracking performance,
which yields a suboptimal bound on the system consensus control and tracking
performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a
simulation example."
"Recent work on complex networks compared the topological and electrical
structures of the power grid, taking into account the underlying physical laws
that govern the electrical connectivity between various components in the
network. A distance metric, namely, resistance distance was introduced to
provide a more comprehensive description of interconnections in power systems
compared with the topological structure, which is based only on geographic
connections between network components. Motivated by these studies, in this
paper we revisit the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem by
deriving the connectivity matrix of the network using resistance distances
between buses in the grid, and use it in the integer program formulations for
several standard IEEE bus systems. The main result of this paper is rather
discouraging: more number of PMUs are required, compared with those obtained
using the topological structure, to meet the desired objective of complete
network observability without zero injection measurements. However, in light of
recent advances in the electrical structure of the grid, our study provides a
more realistic perspective of PMU placement in power systems. By further
exploring the connectivity matrix derived using the electrical structure, we
devise a procedure to solve the placement problem without resorting to linear
programming."
"Algorithms and dynamics over networks often involve randomization, and
randomization may result in oscillating dynamics which fail to converge in a
deterministic sense. In this paper, we observe this undesired feature in three
applications, in which the dynamics is the randomized asynchronous counterpart
of a well-behaved synchronous one. These three applications are network
localization, PageRank computation, and opinion dynamics. Motivated by their
formal similarity, we show the following general fact, under the assumptions of
independence across time and linearities of the updates: if the expected
dynamics is stable and converges to the same limit of the original synchronous
dynamics, then the oscillations are ergodic and the desired limit can be
locally recovered via time-averaging."
"Among the intelligent safety technologies for road vehicles, active
suspensions controlled by embedded computing elements for preventing rollover
have received a lot of attention. The existing models for synthesizing and
allocating forces in such suspensions are conservatively based on the
constraint that no wheels lift off the ground. However, in practice,
smart/active suspensions are more necessary in the situation where the wheels
have just lifted off the ground. The difficulty in computing control in the
last situation is that the problem requires satisfying disjunctive constraints
on the dynamics. To the authors',knowledge, no efficient solution method is
available for the simulation of dynamics with disjunctive constraints and thus
hardware realizable and accurate force allocation in an active suspension tends
to be a difficulty. In this work we give an algorithm for and simulate
numerical solutions of the force allocation problem as an optimal control
problem constrained by dynamics with disjunctive constraints. In particular we
study the allocation and synthesis of time-dependent active suspension forces
in terms of sensor output data in order to stabilize the roll motion of the
road vehicle. An equivalent constraint in the form of a convex combination
(hull) is proposed to satisfy the disjunctive constraints. The validated
numerical simulations show that it is possible to allocate and synthesize
control forces at the active suspensions from sensor output data such that the
forces stabilize the roll moment of the vehicle with its wheels just lifted off
the ground during arbitrary fish-hook maneuvers."
"This paper presents the design and analysis of a compensation method with
application to a 345 kV 480 MVA three-phase transmission line. The compensator
system includes a series injected voltage source converter that minimizes the
resonance effects of capacitor line reactance. This creates an ability to
compensate for the effects of subsynchronous resonance and thereby increase
line loadability and control real and reactive power flows. The granularity of
power flow control and simultaneous stabilization is achieved by the method of
direct decoupled power control (DPC). The design process is detailed with
respect to optimal response characteristics considering variations of line
parameters, realistic transformer impedances, and maximum ramp response rates.
Line effects are demonstrated in a PLECS model in MATLAB, and compensation
control system functionality is verified. A case study is provided of a 345 kV
transmission line from an EMTP simulation in PSCAD that accounts for
distributed parameter effects that are encountered in physical EHV transmission
lines. This demonstrates the improvement in stability to power system
transients as well as damping of power system oscillations."
"This paper presents a robust fixed lag smoother for a class of nonlinear
uncertain systems. A unified scheme, which combines a nonlinear robust
estimator with a stable fixed lag smoother, is presented to improve the error
covariance of the estimation. The robust fixed lag smoother is based on the use
of Integral Quadratic Constraints and minimax LQG control. The state estimator
uses a copy of the system nonlinearity in the estimator and combines an
approximate model of the delayed states to produce a smoothed signal. In order
to see the effectiveness of the method, it is applied to a quantum optical
phase estimation problem. Results show significant improvement in the error
covariance of the estimator using fixed lag smoother in the presence of
nonlinear uncertainty."
"The frequency droop response of conventional turbine driven synchronous
generators with respect to load increases is normally used in order to have
stable operating characteristics for multiple generators operating in parallel
over large geographical regions. This presents a challenge for renewable energy
sources that interface to the transmission grid through static inverters that
do not exhibit an intrinsic frequency droop characteristic. This paper provides
a technique for designing optimal load frequency controllers as transmission
line inverters fed from renewable energy sources that allows for fast dynamic
response due to variable solar and wind conditions while maintain stability to
interconnected synchronous generators. A control technique based on LQG
optimization theory is presented. Detailed analysis of a three-area system in a
region of mixed wind and solar photovoltaic sources is modeled in a manner that
confirms the effectiveness of the disclosed load-frequency control method."
"This work provides a design method for achieving a specified level of
stability for inverter-based interconnected distributed generation. The
stability of parallel connected distributed energy resources determined from a
linearized state-space model of the inverter dynamics that includes the
admittance matrix of the interconnecting distribution lines. Each inverter uses
a localized droop control scheme with the associated voltage and frequency
measurements obtained through the application of an enhanced phase locked loop.
Previous work on this topic has focused on single inverters connected to an
infinite bus without modeling of delays from a phase locked loop
implementation. This proposed method overcomes both of these limitations of
previous research. A detailed large-signal simulation of a three-bus
interconnected power system is analyzed under two different network admittance
values. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed stability design
method."
"In this paper we study a transmission power tune problem with densely
deployed 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). While previous papers
emphasize on tuning transmission power with either PHY or MAC layer separately,
optimally setting each Access Point's (AP's) transmission power of a densely
deployed 802.11 network considering its dual effects on both layers remains an
open problem. In this work, we design a measure by evaluating impacts of
transmission power on network performance on both PHY and MAC layers. We show
that such an optimization problem is intractable and then we investigate and
develop an analytical framework to allow simple yet efficient solutions.
Through simulations and numerical results, we observe clear benefits of the
dual-effect model compared to solutions optimizing solely on a single layer;
therefore, we conclude that tuning transmission power from a dual layer
(PHY-MAC) point of view is essential and necessary for dense WLANs. We further
form a game theoretical framework and investigate above power-tune problem in a
strategic network. We show that with decentralized and strategic users, the
Nash Equilibrium (N.E.) of the corresponding game is in-efficient and
thereafter we propose a punishment based mechanism to enforce users to adopt
the social optimal strategy profile under both perfect and imperfect sensing
environments."
"This paper develops a controller synthesis algorithm for distributed LQG
control problems under output feedback. We consider a system consisting of
three interconnected linear subsystems with a delayed information sharing
structure. While the state-feedback case of this problem has previously been
solved, the extension to output-feedback is nontrivial, as the classical
separation principle fails. To find the optimal solution, the controller is
decomposed into two independent components. One is delayed centralized LQR, and
the other is the sum of correction terms based on additional local information.
Explicit discrete-time equations are derived whose solutions are the gains of
the optimal controller."
"We propose a decentralized subspace algorithm for identification of
large-scale, interconnected systems that are described by sparse (multi) banded
state-space matrices. First, we prove that the state of a local subsystem can
be approximated by a linear combination of inputs and outputs of the local
subsystems that are in its neighborhood. Furthermore, we prove that for
interconnected systems with well-conditioned, finite-time observability
Gramians (or observability matrices), the size of this neighborhood is
relatively small. On the basis of these results, we develop a subspace
identification algorithm that identifies a state-space model of a local
subsystem from the local input-output data. Consequently, the developed
algorithm is computationally feasible for interconnected systems with a large
number of local subsystems. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the
new identification algorithm."
"This paper investigates coverage control for visual sensor networks based on
gradient descent techniques on matrix manifolds. We consider the scenario that
networked vision sensors with controllable orientations are distributed over
3-D space to monitor 2-D environment. Then, the decision variable must be
constrained on the Lie group SO(3). The contribution of this paper is two
folds. The first one is technical, namely we formulate the coverage problem as
an optimization problem on SO(3) without introducing local parameterization
like Eular angles and directly apply the gradient descent algorithm on the
manifold. The second technological contribution is to present not only the
coverage control scheme but also the density estimation process including image
processing and curve fitting while exemplifying its effectiveness through
simulation of moving objects monitoring."
"The control of a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous
work demonstrates that the so-called back-pressure control provides stability
guarantees, assuming infinite queues capacities. In this paper, we highlight
the failing of current back-pressure control under finite capacities by
identifying sources of non work-conservation and congestion propagation. We
propose the use of a normalized pressure which guarantees work conservation and
mitigates congestion propagation, while ensuring fairness at low traffic
densities, and recovering original back-pressure as capacities grow to
infinity. This capacity-aware back-pressure control allows to improve
performance as congestion increases, as indicated by simulation results, and
keeps the key benefits of back-pressure: ability to be distributed over
intersections and O(1) complexity."
"Many systems for which compressive sensing is used today are dynamical. The
common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of
independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the
temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the
state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support
could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the
linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the
Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case,
compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the
particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most
novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with
the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that
neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a
satisfying solution."
"Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is used to activate the dysfunctional
lower limb muscles of individuals with neuromuscular disorders to produce
cycling as a means of exercise and rehabilitation. However, FES-cycling is
still metabolically inefficient and yields low power output at the cycle crank
compared to able-bodied cycling. Previous literature suggests that these
problems are symptomatic of poor muscle control and non-physiological muscle
fiber recruitment. The latter is a known problem with FES in general, and the
former motivates investigation of better control methods for FES-cycling.In
this paper, a stimulation pattern for quadriceps femoris-only FES-cycling is
derived based on the effectiveness of knee joint torque in producing forward
pedaling. In addition, a switched sliding-mode controller is designed for the
uncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider system with autonomous state-dependent
switching. The switched controller yields ultimately bounded tracking of a
desired trajectory in the presence of an unknown, time-varying, bounded
disturbance, provided a reverse dwell-time condition is satisfied by
appropriate choice of the control gains and a sufficient desired cadence.
Stability is derived through Lyapunov methods for switched systems, and
experimental results demonstrate the performance of the switched control system
under typical cycling conditions."
"Multi-modal densities appear frequently in time series and practical
applications. However, they cannot be represented by common state estimators,
such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF),
which additionally suffer from the fact that uncertainty is often not captured
sufficiently well, which can result in incoherent and divergent tracking
performance. In this paper, we address these issues by devising a non-linear
filtering algorithm where densities are represented by Gaussian mixture models,
whose parameters are estimated in closed form. The resulting method exhibits a
superior performance on typical benchmarks."
"This article reviews different kinds of models for the electric power grid
that can be used to understand the modern power system, the smart grid. From
the physical network to abstract energy markets, we identify in the literature
different aspects that co-determine the spatio-temporal multilayer dynamics of
power system. We start our review by showing how the generation, transmission
and distribution characteristics of the traditional power grids are already
subject to complex behaviour appearing as a result of the the interplay between
dynamics of the nodes and topology, namely synchronisation and cascade effects.
When dealing with smart grids, the system complexity increases even more: on
top of the physical network of power lines and controllable sources of
electricity, the modernisation brings information networks, renewable
intermittent generation, market liberalisation, prosumers, among other aspects.
In this case, we forecast a dynamical co-evolution of the smart grid and other
kind of networked systems that cannot be understood isolated. This review
compiles recent results that model electric power grids as complex systems,
going beyond pure technological aspects. From this perspective, we then
indicate possible ways to incorporate the diverse co-evolving systems into the
smart grid model using, for example, network theory and multi-agent simulation."
"This letter proposes a novel sparsity-aware adaptive filtering scheme and
algorithms based on an alternating optimization strategy with shrinkage. The
proposed scheme employs a two-stage structure that consists of an alternating
optimization of a diagonally-structured matrix that speeds up the convergence
and an adaptive filter with a shrinkage function that forces the coefficients
with small magnitudes to zero. We devise alternating optimization least-mean
square (LMS) algorithms for the proposed scheme and analyze its mean-square
error. Simulations for a system identification application show that the
proposed scheme and algorithms outperform in convergence and tracking existing
sparsity-aware algorithms."
"Consider that an autonomous linear time-invariant (LTI) plant is given and
that a network of LTI observers assesses its output vector. The dissemination
of information within the network is dictated by a pre-specified directed graph
in which each vertex represents an observer. Each observer computes its own
state estimate using only the portion of the output vector accessible to it and
the state estimates of other observers that are transmitted to it by its
neighbors, according to the graph. This paper proposes an update rule that is a
natural generalization of consensus, and for which we determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of parameters for the update rule that
lead to asymptotic omniscience of the state of the plant at all observers. The
conditions reduce to certain detectability requirements that imply that if
omniscience is not possible under the proposed scheme then it is not viable
under any other scheme that is subject to the same communication graph,
including nonlinear and time-varying ones."
"A key question that arises in rigorous analysis of cyberphysical systems
under attack involves establishing whether or not the attacked system deviates
significantly from the ideal allowed behavior. This is the problem of deciding
whether or not the ideal system is an abstraction of the attacked system. A
quantitative variation of this question can capture how much the attacked
system deviates from the ideal. Thus, algorithms for deciding abstraction
relations can help measure the effect of attacks on cyberphysical systems and
to develop attack detection strategies. In this paper, we present a decision
procedure for proving that one nonlinear dynamical system is a quantitative
abstraction of another. Directly computing the reach sets of these nonlinear
systems are undecidable in general and reach set over-approximations do not
give a direct way for proving abstraction. Our procedure uses (possibly
inaccurate) numerical simulations and a model annotation to compute tight
approximations of the observable behaviors of the system and then uses these
approximations to decide on abstraction. We show that the procedure is sound
and that it is guaranteed to terminate under reasonable robustness assumptions."
"The discrete-time robust repetitive control (RC, or repetitive controller,
also designated RC) problem for nonlinear systems is both challenging and
practical. This paper proposes a discrete-time output-feedback RC design for a
class of systems subject to measurable nonlinearities to track reference
robustly with respect to the period variation. The design relies on additive
state decomposition, by which the output-feedback RC problem is decomposed into
an output-feedback RC problem for a linear time-invariant system and a
state-feedback stabilization problem for a nonlinear system. Thanks to the
decomposition, existing controller design methods in both the frequency domain
and time domain can be employed to make the robustness and discretization for a
nonlinear system tractable. To demonstrate the effectiveness, an illustrative
example is given."
"The design of ideal internal dynamics (IID) generators, namely solving IID,
is a fundamental problem, which is a key step to handle the nonminimum-phase
output tracking problem. In this paper, for a class of unstable matrix
differential equations, a new causal dynamic IID generator is proposed, whose
parameters are partly chosen via H_2/H_inf optimization. Compared with existing
similar generators, it is applicable to matrix differential equations with
singular system matrices and is easily extended to slowly time-varying matrix
differential equations without extra computation."
"This paper presents a fuzzy inference system for voltage/reactive power
control in distribution substations. The purpose is go forward to automation
distribution and its implementation in isolated power systems where control
capabilities are limited and it is common using the same applications as in
continental power systems. This means that lot of functionalities do not apply
and computational burden generates high response times. A fuzzy controller,
with logic guidelines embedded based upon heuristic rules resulting from
operators at dispatch control center past experience, has been designed.
Working as an on-line tool, it has been tested under real conditions and it has
managed the operation during a whole day in a distribution substation. Within
the limits of control capabilities of the system, the controller maintained
successfully an acceptable voltage profile, power factor values over 0,98 and
it has ostensibly improved the performance given by an optimal power flow based
automation system."
"Several convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem have
recently been developed using both bus injection models and branch flow models.
In this paper, we prove relations among three convex relaxations: a
semidefinite relaxation that computes a full matrix, a chordal relaxation based
on a chordal extension of the network graph, and a second-order cone relaxation
that computes the smallest partial matrix. We prove a bijection between the
feasible sets of the OPF in the bus injection model and the branch flow model,
establishing the equivalence of these two models and their second-order cone
relaxations. Our results imply that, for radial networks, all these relaxations
are equivalent and one should always solve the second-order cone relaxation.
For mesh networks, the semidefinite relaxation is tighter than the second-order
cone relaxation but requires a heavier computational effort, and the chordal
relaxation strikes a good balance. Simulations are used to illustrate these
results."
"Randomized optimization is an established tool for control design with
modulated robustness. While for uncertain convex programs there exist
randomized approaches with efficient sampling, this is not the case for
non-convex problems. Approaches based on statistical learning theory are
applicable to non-convex problems, but they usually are conservative in terms
of performance and require high sample complexity to achieve the desired
probabilistic guarantees. In this paper, we derive a novel scenario approach
for a wide class of random non-convex programs, with a sample complexity
similar to that of uncertain convex programs and with probabilistic guarantees
that hold not only for the optimal solution of the scenario program, but for
all feasible solutions inside a set of a-priori chosen complexity. We also
address measure-theoretic issues for uncertain convex and non-convex programs.
Among the family of non-convex control- design problems that can be addressed
via randomization, we apply our scenario approach to randomized Model
Predictive Control for chance-constrained nonlinear control-affine systems."
"The control of a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous
works proposed a feedback control belonging to the family of the so-called
back-pressure controls that ensures provably maximum stability given
pre-specified routing probabilities. However, this optimal back-pressure
controller (BP*) requires routing rates and a measure of the number of vehicles
queuing at a node for each possible routing decision. It is an idealistic
assumption for our application since vehicles (going straight, turning
left/right) are all gathered in the same lane apart from the proximity of the
intersection and cameras can only give estimations of the aggregated queue
length. In this paper, we present a back-pressure traffic signal controller
(BP) that does not require routing rates, it requires only aggregated queue
lengths estimation (without direction information) and loop detectors at the
stop line for each possible direction. A theoretical result on the Lyapunov
drift in heavy load conditions under BP control is provided and tends to
indicate that BP should have good stability properties. Simulations confirm
this and show that BP stabilizes the queuing network in a significant part of
the capacity region."
"Swarm stability is concerned for descriptor compartmental networks with
linear time-invariant protocol. Compartmental network is a specific type of
dynamical multi-agent system. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both
consensus and critical swarm stability are presented, which require a joint
matching between the interactive dynamics of nearest neighboring vertices and
the Laplacian spectrum of the overall network topology. Three numerical
instances are illustrated to verify the theoretical results."
"A recursive state estimation procedure is derived for a linear time varying
system with both parametric uncertainties and stochastic measurement droppings.
This estimator has a similar form as that of the Kalman filter with
intermittent observations, but its parameters should be adjusted when a plant
output measurement arrives. A new recursive form is derived for the
pseudo-covariance matrix of estimation errors, which plays important roles in
analyzing its asymptotic properties. Based on a Riemannian metric for positive
definite matrices, some necessary and sufficient conditions have been obtained
for the strict contractiveness of an iteration of this recursion. It has also
been proved that under some controllability and observability conditions, as
well as some weak requirements on measurement arrival probability, the gain
matrix of this recursive robust state estimator converges in probability one to
a stationary distribution. Numerical simulation results show that estimation
accuracy of the suggested procedure is more robust against parametric modelling
errors than the Kalman filter."
"This paper presents heuristic algorithms for interleaved pulse scheduling
problems on multi-target tracking in pulse Doppler phased array radars that can
process multiple simultaneous received beams. The interleaved pulse scheduling
problems for element and subarray level digital beamforming architectures are
formulated as the same integer program and the asymptotic time complexities of
the algorithms are analyzed."
"Subspace identification is revisited in the scope of nuclear norm
minimization methods. It is shown that essential structural knowledge about the
unknown data matrices in the data equation that relates Hankel matrices
constructed from input and output data can be used in the first step of the
numerical solution presented. The structural knowledge comprises the low rank
property of a matrix that is the product of the extended observability matrix
and the state sequence and the Toeplitz structure of the matrix of Markov
parameters (of the system in innovation form). The new subspace identification
method is referred to as the N2SID (twice the N of Nuclear Norm and SID for
Subspace IDentification) method. In addition to include key structural
knowledge in the solution it integrates the subspace calculation with
minimization of a classical prediction error cost function. The nuclear norm
relaxation enables us to perform such integration while preserving convexity.
The advantages of N2SID are demonstrated in a numerical open- and closed-loop
simulation study. Here a comparison is made with another widely used SID
method, i.e. N4SID. The comparison focusses on the identification with short
data batches, i.e. where the number of measurements is a small multiple of the
system order."
"Some necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the controllability
and observability of a networked system with linear time invariant (LTI)
dynamics. The topology of this system is fixed but arbitrary, and every
subsystem is permitted to have different dynamic input-output relations. These
conditions essentially depend only on transmission zeros of every subsystem and
the connection matrix among subsystems, which makes them attractive in the
analysis and synthesis of a large scale networked system. As an application,
these conditions are utilized to characterize systems whose steady state
estimation accuracy with the distributed predictor developed in (Zhou, 2013) is
equal to that of the lumped Kalman filter. Some necessary and sufficient
conditions on system matrices are derived for this equivalence. It has been
made clear that to guarantee this equivalence, the steady state update gain
matrix of the Kalman filter must be block diagonal."
"We consider a network of event-based systems that use a shared wireless
medium to communicate with their respective controllers. These systems use a
contention resolution mechanism to arbitrate access to the shared network. We
identify sufficient conditions for Lyapunov mean square stability of each
control system in the network, and design event-based policies that guarantee
it. Our stability analysis is based on a Markov model that removes the
network-induced correlation between the states of the control systems in the
network. Analyzing the stability of this Markov model remains a challenge, as
the event-triggering policy renders the estimation error non-Gaussian. Hence,
we identify an auxiliary system that furnishes an upper bound for the variance
of the system states. Using the stability analysis, we design policies, such as
the constant-probability policy, for adapting the event-triggering thresholds
to the delay in accessing the network. Realistic wireless networked control
examples illustrate the applicability of the presented approach."
"In Model-Based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), it is often desirable
to develop several models of varying fidelity. Models of different fidelity
levels can enable mathematical analysis of the model, control synthesis, faster
simulation etc. Furthermore, when (automatically or manually) transitioning
from a model to its implementation on an actual computational platform, then
again two different versions of the same system are being developed. In all
previous cases, it is necessary to define a rigorous notion of conformance
between different models and between models and their implementations. This
paper argues that conformance should be a measure of distance between systems.
Albeit a range of theoretical distance notions exists, a way to compute such
distances for industrial size systems and models has not been proposed yet.
This paper addresses exactly this problem. A universal notion of conformance as
closeness between systems is rigorously defined, and evidence is presented that
this implies a number of other application-dependent conformance notions. An
algorithm for detecting that two systems are not conformant is then proposed,
which uses existing proven tools. A method is also proposed to measure the
degree of conformance between two systems. The results are demonstrated on a
range of models."
"This paper completely solves the controllability problems of two-dimensional
multi-input discrete-time bilinear systems with and without drift. Necessary
and sufficient conditions for controllability, which cover the existing
results, are obtained by using an algebraic method. Furthermore, for the
uncontrollable systems, near-controllability is studied and necessary and
sufficient conditions for the systems to be nearly controllable are also
presented. Examples are provided to demonstrate the conceptions and results of
the paper."
"There has been much research on network flows over time due to their
important role in real world applications. This has led to many results, but
the more challenging continuous time model still lacks some of the key concepts
and techniques that are the cornerstones of static network flows. The aim of
this paper is to advance the state of the art for dynamic network flows by
developing the continuous time analogues of the theory for static network
flows. Specifically, we make use of ideas from the static case to establish a
reduced cost optimality condition, a negative cycle optimality condition, and a
strong duality result for a very general class of network flows over time."
"This paper considers the synchronization problem for networks of coupled
nonlinear dynamical systems under switching communication topologies. Two types
of nonlinear agent dynamics are considered. The first one is non-expansive
dynamics (stable dynamics with a convex Lyapunov function $\varphi(\cdot)$) and
the second one is dynamics that satisfies a global Lipschitz condition. For the
non-expansive case, we show that various forms of joint connectivity for
communication graphs are sufficient for networks to achieve global asymptotic
$\varphi$-synchronization. We also show that $\varphi$-synchronization leads to
state synchronization provided that certain additional conditions are
satisfied. For the globally Lipschitz case, unlike the non-expansive case,
joint connectivity alone is not sufficient for achieving synchronization. A
sufficient condition for reaching global exponential synchronization is
established in terms of the relationship between the global Lipschitz constant
and the network parameters. We also extend the results to leader-follower
networks."
"This paper studies near-controllability of a class of discrete-time bilinear
systems via a root locus approach. A necessary and sufficient criterion for the
systems to be nearly controllable is given. In particular, by using the root
locus approach, the control inputs which achieve the state transition for the
nearly controllable systems can be computed. Furthermore, for the non-nearly
controllable systems, nearly-controllable subspaces are derived and
near-controllability index is defined. Accordingly, the controllability
properties of such class of discrete-time bilinear systems are fully
characterized. Finally, examples are provided to demonstrate the results of the
paper."
"Based on a reduced-order, dynamic nonlinear wind turbine model in
Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model structure, a TS state observer is designed as a
disturbance observer to estimate the unknown effective wind speed. The TS
observer model is an exact representation of the underlying nonlinear model,
obtained by means of the sector-nonlinearity approach. The observer gain
matrices are obtained by means of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) design
approach for optimal fuzzy control, where weighting matrices for the individual
system states and outputs are included. The observer is tested in simulations
with the aero-elastic code FAST for the NREL 5 MW reference turbine, where it
shows a stable behaviour both for IEC wind gusts and turbulent wind input."
"In this report proofs are presented for a method for abstracting continuous
dynamical systems by timed automata. The method is based on partitioning the
state space of dynamical systems with invariant sets, which form cells
representing locations of the timed automata.
  To enable verification of the dynamical system based on the abstraction,
conditions for obtaining sound, complete, and refinable abstractions are set
up.
  It is proposed to partition the state space utilizing sub-level sets of
Lyapunov functions, since they are positive invariant sets. The existence of
sound abstractions for Morse-Smale systems and complete and refinable
abstractions for linear systems are proved."
"In this paper, Fuzzy Logic controller is developed for ac/ac Matrix
Converter. Furthermore, Total Harmonic Distortion is reduced significantly.
Space Vector Algorithm is a method to improve power quality of the converter
output. But its quality is limited to 86.7%.We are introduced a Cross coupled
DQ axis controller to improve power quality. The Matrix Converter is an
attractive topology for High voltage transformation ratio. A Matlab / Simulink
simulation analysis of the Matrix Converter system is provided. The design and
implementation of fuzzy controlled Matrix Converter is described. This AC-AC
system is proposed as an effective replacement for the conventional AC-DC-AC
system which employs a two-step power conversion."
"Ecommerce is an area where an Autonomic Computing system could be very
effectively deployed. Ecommerce has created demand for high quality information
technology services and businesses are seeking quality of service guarantees
from their service providers. These guarantees are expressed as part of service
level agreements. Properly adjusting tuning parameters for enforcement of the
service level agreement is time-consuming and skills-intensive. Moreover, in
case of changes to the workload, the setting of the parameters may no longer be
optimum. In an ecommerce system, where the workload changes frequently, there
is a need to update the parameters at regular intervals. This paper describes
two approaches, one, using a proportional controller and two, using a fuzzy
controller, to automate the tuning of MaxClients parameter of Apache web server
based on the required response time and the current workload. This is an
illustration of the self-optimizing characteristic of an autonomic computing
system."
"This paper considers a novel problem of how to choose an appropriate geometry
for a group of agents with only shape constraints but with a flexible scale.
Instead of assigning the formation system with a specific geometry, here the
only requirement on the desired geometry is a shape without any location,
rotation and, most importantly, scale constraints. Optimal rigid transformation
between two different geometries is discussed with especial focus on the
scaling operation, and the cooperative performance of the system is evaluated
by what we call the geometries degrees of similarity (DOS) with respect to the
desired shape during the entire convergence process. The design of the scale
when measuring the DOS is discussed from constant value and time-varying
function perspectives respectively. Fixed structured nonlinear control laws
that are functions on the scale are developed to guarantee the exponential
convergence of the system to the assigned shape. Our research is originated
from a three-agent formation system and is further extended to multiple (n > 3)
agents by defining a triangular complement graph. Simulations demonstrate that
formation system with the time-varying scale function outperforms the one with
an arbitrary constant scale, and the relationship between underlying topology
and the system performance is further discussed based on the simulation
observations. Moveover, the control scheme is applied to bearing-only
sensor-target localization to show its application potentials."
"This paper takes an empirical approach to identify operational factors at
busy airports that may predate go-around maneuvers. Using four years of data
from San Francisco International Airport, we begin our investigation with a
statistical approach to investigate which features of airborne, ground
operations (e.g., number of inbound aircraft, number of aircraft taxiing from
gate, etc.) or weather are most likely to fluctuate, relative to nominal
operations, in the minutes immediately preceding a missed approach. We analyze
these findings both in terms of their implication on current airport operations
and discuss how the antecedent factors may affect NextGen. Finally, as a means
to assist air traffic controllers, we draw upon techniques from the machine
learning community to develop a preliminary alert system for go-around
prediction."
"A method to quantify the probabilistic controller taskload inherent to
maintaining aircraft adherence to 4-D trajectories within flow corridors is
presented. An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of the aircraft motion and a Poisson
model of the flow scheduling are introduced along with reasonable numerical
values of the model parameters. Analytic expressions are derived for the
taskload probability density functions for basic functional elements of the
flow structure. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for these basic
functional elements and the controller taskload probabilities are exhibited."
"In this paper, describing function method is used to analyze the
characteristics and parameters selection of differentiators. Nonlinear
differentiator is an effective compensation to linear differentiator, and
hybrid differentiator consisting of linear and nonlinear parts is the
combination of both advantages of linear and nonlinear differentiators. The
merits of the hybrid differentiator include its simplicity, rapid convergence
at all times, and restraining noises effectively. The methods are confirmed by
some examples."
"A nonlinear differentiator being fit for rapid convergence is presented,
which is based on singular perturbation technique. The differentiator design
can not only sufficiently reduce the chattering phenomenon of derivative
estimation by introducing a continuous power function, but the dynamical
performances are also improved by adding linear correction terms to the
nonlinear ones. Moreover, strong robustness ability is obtained by integrating
nonlinear items and the linear filter. The merits of the rapid-convergent
differentiator include the excellent dynamical performances, restraining noises
sufficiently, avoiding the chattering phenomenon and being not based on system
model. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulations and an
experiment."
"The equivalence between integral-chain differentiator and usual high-gain
differentiator is given under suitable coordinate transformation.
Integral-chain differentiator can restrain noises more thoroughly than usual
high-gain linear differentiator. In integral-chain differentiator, disturbances
only exist in the last differential equation and can be restrained through each
layer of integrator. Moreover, a nonlinear integral-chain differentiator is
designed which is the expansion of linear integral-chain differentiator.
Finally, a 3-order differentiator is applied to the estimation of acceleration
for a second-order uncertain system."
"Airport departure operations constitute an important source of airline delays
and passenger frustration. Excessive surface traffic is the cause of increased
controller and pilot workload; It is also the source of increased emissions; It
worsens traffic safety and often does not yield improved runway throughput.
Acknowledging this fact, this paper explores some of the feedback mechanisms by
which airport traffic can be optimized in real time according to its current
degree of congestion. In particular, it examines the environmnetal benefits
that improved surveillance technologies can bring in the context of gate- or
spot-release aircraft strategies. It is shown that improvements can lead yield
4% to 6% emission reductions for busy airports like New-York La Guardia or
Seattle Tacoma. These benefits come on top of the benefits already obtained by
adopting threshold strategies currently under evaluation."
"High availability has always been one of the main problems for a data center.
Till now high availability was achieved by host per host redundancy, a highly
expensive method in terms of hardware and human costs. A new approach to the
problem can be offered by virtualization. Using virtualization, it is possible
to achieve a redundancy system for all the services running on a data center.
This new approach to high availability allows the running virtual machines to
be distributed over a small number of servers, by exploiting the features of
the virtualization layer: start, stop and move virtual machines between
physical hosts. The 3RC system is based on a finite state machine, providing
the possibility to restart each virtual machine over any physical host, or
reinstall it from scratch. A complete infrastructure has been developed to
install operating system and middleware in a few minutes. To virtualize the
main servers of a data center, a new procedure has been developed to migrate
physical to virtual hosts. The whole Grid data center SNS-PISA is running at
the moment in virtual environment under the high availability system."
"The purpose of this work is to design a state feedback controller using
Parametric Eigenstructure Assignment (PAE) technique that has the capacity to
be reconfigured in the case that partial actuator faults occur. The proposed
controller is capable of compensating the gain losses in actuators and
maintaining the control performance in faulty situations. Simulations show the
performance enhancement in comparison to the non-reconfigurable controller
through Integral Absolute Error (IAE) index for different fault scenarios."
"We define a special class of hybrid automata, called Deterministic and
Transversal Linear Hybrid Automata (DTLHA), whose continuous dynamics in each
location are linear time-invariant (LTI) with a constant input, and for which
every discrete transition up to a given bounded time is deterministic and,
importantly, transversal. For such a DTLHA starting from an initial state, we
show that it is possible to compute an approximation of the reach set of a
DTLHA over a finite time interval that is arbitrarily close to the exact reach
set, called a bounded epsilon-reach set, through sampling and polyhedral
over-approximation of sampled states. We propose an algorithm and an attendant
architecture for the overall bounded epsilon-reach set computation process."
"This paper investigates the design problem of observers for nonlinear
descriptor systems described by Takagi-Sugeno (TS) system; Depending on the
available knowledge on the premise variables two cases are considered. First a
TS descriptor system with measurables premises variables are proposed. Second,
an observer design which satisfying the Lipschitz condition is proposed when
the premises variables are unmeasurables. The convergence of the state
estimation error is studied using the Lyapunov theory and the stability
conditions are given in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Examples
are included to illustrate those methods."
"We propose a distributed algorithm for controlling traffic signals. Our
algorithm is adapted from backpressure routing, which has been mainly applied
to communication and power networks. We formally prove that our algorithm
ensures global optimality as it leads to maximum network throughput even though
the controller is constructed and implemented in a completely distributed
manner. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms
SCATS, an adaptive traffic signal control system that is being used in many
cities."
"Information about the strength of gas sources in buildings has a number of
applications in the area of building automation and control, including
temperature and ventilation control, fire detection and security systems. Here,
we consider the problem of estimating the strength of a gas source in an
enclosure when some of the parameters of the gas transport process are unknown.
Traditionally, these problems are either solved by the Maximum-Likelihood (ML)
method which is accurate but computationally intense, or by Recursive Least
Squares (RLS, also Kalman) filtering which is simpler but less accurate. In
this paper, we suggest a different statistical estimation procedure based on
the concept of Method of Moments. We outline techniques that make this
procedure computationally efficient and amenable for recursive implementation.
We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed method based on experimental
results as well as Monte-Carlo simulations. When used with the building control
systems, these algorithms can estimate the gaseous strength in a room both
quickly and accurately, and can potentially provide improved indoor air quality
in an efficient manner."
"The Quasi Steady-State (QSS) model of long-term dynamics relies on the idea
of time-scale decomposition. Assuming that the fast variables are infinitely
fast and are stable in the long-term, the QSS model replaces the differential
equations of transient dynamics by their equilibrium equations to reduce
complexity and increase computation efficiency. Although the idea of QSS model
is intuitive, its theoretical foundation has not yet been developed. In this
paper, several counter examples in which the QSS model fails to provide a
correct approximation of the complete dynamic model in power system are
presented and the reasons of the failure are explained from the viewpoint of
nonlinear analysis."
"A functional electrical stimulation (FES)-based tracking controller is
developed to enable cycling based on a strategy to yield force direction
efficiency by exploiting antagonistic bi-articular muscles. Given the input
redundancy naturally occurring among multiple muscle groups, the force
direction at the pedal is explicitly determined as a means to improve the
efficiency of cycling. A model of a stationary cycle and rider is developed as
a closed-chain mechanism. A strategy is then developed to switch between muscle
groups for improved efficiency based on the force direction of each muscle
group. Stability of the developed controller is analyzed through Lyapunov-based
methods."
"We study the problem of optimal incentive design for voluntary participation
of electricity customers in a Direct Load Scheduling (DLS) program, a new form
of Direct Load Control (DLC) based on a three way communication protocol
between customers, embedded controls in flexible appliances, and the central
entity in charge of the program. Participation decisions are made in real-time
on an event-based basis, with every customer that needs to use a flexible
appliance considering whether to join the program given current incentives.
Customers have different interpretations of the level of risk associated with
committing to pass over the control over the consumption schedule of their
devices to an operator, and these risk levels are only privately known. The
operator maximizes his expected profit of operating the DLS program by posting
the right participation incentives for different appliance types, in a publicly
available and dynamically updated table. Customers are then faced with the
dynamic decision making problem of whether to take the incentives and
participate or not. We define an optimization framework to determine the
profit-maximizing incentives for the operator. In doing so, we also investigate
the utility that the operator expects to gain from recruiting different types
of devices. These utilities also provide an upper-bound on the benefits that
can be attained from any type of demand response program."
"We consider an exponentially stable closed loop interconnection of a
continuous linear plant and a continuous linear controller, and we study the
problem of interconnecting the plant output to the controller input through a
digital channel. We propose a family of ""transmission-lazy"" sensors whose goal
is to transmit the measured plant output information as little as possible
while preserving closed-loop stability. In particular, we propose two
transmission policies, providing conditions on the transmission parameters.
These guarantee global asymptotic stability when the plant state is available
or when an estimate of the state is available (provided by a classical
continuous linear observer). Moreover, under a specific condition, they
guarantee global exponential stability"
"Recently it has been shown that an aggregation of Thermostatically Controlled
Loads (TCLs) can be utilized to provide fast regulating reserve service for
power grids and the behavior of the aggregation can be captured by a stochastic
battery with dissipation. In this paper, we address two practical issues
associated with the proposed battery model. First, we address clustering of a
heterogeneous collection and show that by finding the optimal dissipation
parameter for a given collection, one can divide these units into few clusters
and improve the overall battery model. Second, we analytically characterize the
impact of imposing a no-short-cycling requirement on TCLs as constraints on the
ramping rate of the regulation signal. We support our theorems by providing
simulation results."
"This paper proposes a correction method, which corrects the actual compressor
performance in real operating conditions to the equivalent performance under
specified reference condition. The purpose is to make fair comparisons between
actual performance against design performance or reference maps under the same
operating conditions. Then the abnormal operating conditions or early failure
indications can be identified through condition monitoring, which helps to
avoid mandatory shutdown and reduces maintenance costs. The corrections are
based on an iterative scheme, which simultaneously correct the main performance
parameters known as the polytropic head, the gas power, and the polytropic
efficiency. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by
performing the corrections over real industrial measurements."
"A mathematical model of the circadian dynamics in the form of Van der Pol
equation with an external force as a control is investigated. The combination
of backstepping method and differential-topological techniques based on the
Poincare's ideas is used. The robust model identification adaptive control for
a specific adaptation law is designed."
"In this paper, we consider multi-dimensional maximal cost-bounded
reachability probability over continuous-time Markov decision processes
(CTMDPs). Our major contributions are as follows. Firstly, we derive an
integral characterization which states that the maximal cost-bounded
reachability probability function is the least fixed point of a system of
integral equations. Secondly, we prove that the maximal cost-bounded
reachability probability can be attained by a measurable deterministic
cost-positional scheduler. Thirdly, we provide a numerical approximation
algorithm for maximal cost-bounded reachability probability. We present these
results under the setting of both early and late schedulers."
"We consider first and second order consensus algorithms in networks with
stochastic disturbances. We quantify the deviation from consensus using the
notion of network coherence, which can be expressed as an $H_2$ norm of the
stochastic system. We use the setting of fractal networks to investigate the
question of whether a purely topological measure, such as the fractal
dimension, can capture the asymptotics of coherence in the large system size
limit. Our analysis for first-order systems is facilitated by connections
between first-order stochastic consensus and the global mean first passage time
of random walks. We then show how to apply similar techniques to analyze
second-order stochastic consensus systems. Our analysis reveals that two
networks with the same fractal dimension can exhibit different asymptotic
scalings for network coherence. Thus, this topological characterization of the
network does not uniquely determine coherence behavior. The question of whether
the performance of stochastic consensus algorithms in large networks can be
captured by purely topological measures, such as the spatial dimension, remains
open."
"Photoplethysmography is a prevalent, non-invasive heart monitoring method. In
this paper an implementation of photoplethysmography on the Raspberry Pi is
presented. Two modulation techniques are discussed, which make possible to
measure these signals by the Raspberry Pi, using an external sound card as A/D
converter. Furthermore, it is shown, how can digital signal processing improve
signal quality. The presented methods can be used in low-cost cardiac function
monitoring, in telemedicine applications and in education as well, since cheap
and current hardware are used. Full documentation and open-source software for
the measurement available:

"The Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter is proposed for state estimation
and fault diagnosis in distributed parameter systems and particularly in
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations of the nonlinear
wave type. At a first stage, a nonlinear filtering approach for estimating the
dynamics of a 1D nonlinear wave equation, from measurements provided from a
small number of sensors is developed. It is shown that the numerical solution
of the associated partial differential equation results into a set of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations. With the application of diffeomorphism that is
based on differential flatness theory it is shown that an equivalent
description of the system is obtained in the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form.
This transformation enables to obtain local estimates about the state vector of
the system through the application of the standard Kalman Filter recursion. At
a second stage, the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis is used to
perform fault diagnosis for the distributed parameters system by processing
with elaborated statistical tools the differences (residuals) between the
output of the Kalman Filter and the measurements obtained from the distributed
parameter system. Optimal selection of the fault threshold is succeeded by
using the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis. The efficiency of the
proposed filtering approach for performing fault diagnosis in distributed
parameters systems is confirmed through simulation experiments."
"This article deals with stabilizing discrete-time switched linear systems.
Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, given a family of linear systems
possibly containing unstable dynamics, we propose a large class of switching
signals that stabilize a switched system generated by the switching signal and
the given family of systems. Secondly, given a switched system, a sufficient
condition for the existence of the proposed switching signal is derived by
expressing the switching signal as an infinite walk on a directed graph
representing the switched system. Thirdly, given a family of linear systems, we
propose an algorithmic technique to design a switching signal for stabilizing
the corresponding switched system."
"Optimal experiment design for parameter estimation is a research topic that
has been in the interest of various studies. A key problem in optimal input
design is that the optimal input depends on some unknown system parameters that
are to be identified. Adaptive design is one of the fundamental routes to
handle this problem. Although there exist a rich collection of results on
adaptive experiment design, there are few results that address these issues for
dynamic systems. This paper proposes an adaptive input design method for
general single-input single-output linear-time-invariant systems."
"The small medium large system (SMLSystem) is a house built at the Universidad
CEU Cardenal Herrera (CEU-UCH) for participation in the Solar Decathlon 2013
competition. Several technologies have been integrated to reduce power
consumption. One of these is a forecasting system based on artificial neural
networks (ANNs), which is able to predict indoor temperature in the near future
using captured data by a complex monitoring system as the input. A study of the
impact on forecasting performance of different covariate combinations is
presented in this paper. Additionally, a comparison of ANNs with the standard
statistical forecasting methods is shown. The research in this paper has been
focused on forecasting the indoor temperature of a house, as it is directly
related to HVAC---heating, ventilation and air conditioning---system
consumption. HVAC systems at the SMLSystem house represent 53.9% of the overall
power consumption. The energy used to maintain temperature was measured to be
30--38.9% of the energy needed to lower it. Hence, these forecasting measures
allow the house to adapt itself to future temperature conditions by using home
automation in an energy-efficient manner. Experimental results show a high
forecasting accuracy and therefore, they might be used to efficiently control
an HVAC system."
"A barrier certificate can separate the state space of a con- sidered hybrid
system (HS) into safe and unsafe parts ac- cording to the safety property to be
verified. Therefore this notion has been widely used in the verification of
HSs. A stronger condition on barrier certificates means that less expressive
barrier certificates can be synthesized. On the other hand, synthesizing more
expressive barrier certificates often means high complexity. In [9], Kong et al
consid- ered how to relax the condition of barrier certificates while still
keeping their convexity so that one can synthesize more expressive barrier
certificates efficiently using semi-definite programming (SDP). In this paper,
we first discuss how to relax the condition of barrier certificates in a
general way, while still keeping their convexity. Particularly, one can then
utilize different weaker conditions flexibly to synthesize dif- ferent kinds of
barrier certificates with more expressiveness efficiently using SDP. These
barriers give more opportuni- ties to verify the considered system. We also
show how to combine two functions together to form a combined barrier
certificate in order to prove a safety property under consid- eration, whereas
neither of them can be used as a barrier certificate separately, even according
to any relaxed condi- tion. Another contribution of this paper is that we
discuss how to discover certificates from the general relaxed condi- tion by
SDP. In particular, we focus on how to avoid the unsoundness because of numeric
error caused by SDP with symbolic checking"
"We consider the problem of cooperative intersection management. It arises in
automated transportation systems for people or goods but also in multi-robots
environment. Therefore many solutions have been proposed to avoid collisions.
The main problem is to determine collision-free but also deadlock-free and
optimal algorithms. Even with a simple definition of optimality, finding a
global optimum is a problem of high complexity, especially for open systems
involving a large and varying number of vehicles. This paper advocates the use
of a mathematical framework based on a decomposition of the problem into a
continuous optimization part and a scheduling problem. The paper emphasizes
connections between the usual notion of vehicle priority and an abstract
formulation of the scheduling problem in the coordination space. A constructive
locally optimal algorithm is proposed. More generally, this work opens up for
new computationally efficient cooperative motion planning algorithms."
"Networked Control Systems (NCS) are distributed systems where plants,
sensors, actuators and controllers communicate over shared networks. Non-ideal
behaviors of the communication network include variable sampling/transmission
intervals and communication delays, packet losses, communication constraints
and quantization errors. NCS have been the object of intensive study in the
last few years. However, due to the inherent complexity of NCS, current
literature focuses on only a subset of these non-idealities and mostly
considers stability and stabilizability problems. Recent technology advances
indeed demand that different and more complex control objectives are
considered. In this paper we present first a general model of NCS, including
all the non-idealities of the communication network; then, we propose a
symbolic model approach to the control design with objectives expressed in
terms of non-deterministic transition systems. The presented results are based
on recent advances in symbolic control design of hybrid and continuous control
systems. An example in the context of robot motion planning with remote control
is included, showing the effectiveness of the approach taken."
"The integration of renewable sources poses challenges at the operational and
economic levels of the power grid. In terms of keeping the balance between
supply and demand, the usual scheme of supply following load may not be
appropriate for large penetration levels of uncertain and intermittent
renewable supply. In this paper, we focus on an alternative scheme in which the
load follows the supply, exploiting the flexibility associated with the demand
side. We consider a model of flexible loads that are to be serviced by
zero-marginal cost renewable power together with conventional generation if
necessary. Each load demands 1 kW for a specified number of time slots within
an operational period. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the
service may be delivered over any slots within the operational period. Loads
therefore require flexible energy services that are differentiated by the
demanded duration. We focus on two problems associated with
durations-differentiated loads. The first problem deals with the operational
decisions that a supplier has to make to serve a given set of duration
differentiated loads. The second problem focuses on a market implementation for
duration differentiated services. We give necessary and sufficient conditions
under which the available power can service the loads, and we describe an
algorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available
supply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be
purchased to service the loads. Next we consider a forward market where
consumers can purchase duration differentiated energy services. We first
characterize social welfare maximizing allocations in this forward market and
then show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium."
"This article deals with the consensus problem involving agents with
time-varying singularities in the dynamics or communication in undirected graph
networks. Existing results provide control laws which guarantee asymptotic
consensus. These results are based on the analysis of a system switching
between piecewise constant and time-invariant dynamics. This work introduces a
new analysis technique relying upon classical notions of persistence of
excitation to study the convergence properties of the time-varying multi-agent
dynamics. Since the individual edge weights pass through singularities and vary
with time, the closed-loop dynamics consists of a non-autonomous linear system.
Instead of simplifying to a piecewise continuous switched system as in
literature, smooth variations in edge weights are allowed, albeit assuming an
underlying persistence condition which characterizes sufficient inter-agent
communication to reach consensus. The consensus task is converted to
edge-agreement in order to study a stabilization problem to which classical
persistence based results apply. The new technique allows precise computation
of the rate of convergence to the consensus value."
"Coupled Tank system used for liquid level control is a model of plant that
has usually been used in industries especially chemical process industries.
Level control is also very important for mixing reactant process. This survey
paper tries to presents in a systemic way an approach predictive control
strategy for a system that is similar to the process and is represented by two
liquid tanks. This system of coupled Tank is one of the most commonly available
systems representing a coupled Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system.
With 2 inputs and 2 outputs, it is the most primitive form of a coupled
multivariable system. Therefor the basic concept of how the coupled tanks
system works is by using a numerical system which it operates with a flow
control valve FCV as main control of the level of liquid in one tank or both
tanks. For this paper, MPC algorithm control is used which will be developed
below. And it is focuses on the design and modelling for coupled tanks system.
The steps followed for the design of the controller are: Developing a state
space system model for the coupled tank system then design an MPC controller
for the developed system model. And study the effect of the disturbance on
measured level output. Note that the implementation Model Predictive Controller
on flow controller valve in a Coupled Tank liquid level system is one of the
new methods of controlling liquid level."
"Flexibility in electric power consumption can be leveraged by Demand Response
(DR) programs. The goal of this paper is to systematically capture the inherent
aggregate flexibility of a population of appliances. We do so by clustering
individual loads based on their characteristics and service constraints. We
highlight the challenges associated with learning the customer response to
economic incentives while applying demand side management to heterogeneous
appliances. We also develop a framework to quantify customer privacy in direct
load scheduling programs."
"To respond to volatility and congestion in the power grid, demand response
(DR) mechanisms allow for shaping the load compared to a base load profile.
When tapping on a large population of heterogeneous appliances as a DR
resource, the challenge is in modeling the dimensions available for control.
Such models need to strike the right balance between accuracy of the model and
tractability. The goal of this paper is to provide a medium-grained stochastic
hybrid model to represent a population of appliances that belong to two
classes: deferrable or thermostatically controlled loads. We preserve quantized
information regarding individual load constraints, while discarding information
about the identity of appliance owners. The advantages of our proposed
population model are 1) it allows us to model and control load in a scalable
fashion, useful for ex-ante planning by an aggregator or for real-time load
control; 2) it allows for the preservation of the privacy of end-use customers
that own submetered or directly controlled appliances."
"The evaluation of multiple target tracking algorithms with labelled sets can
be done using the labelled optimal subpattern assignment (LOSPA) metric. In
this paper, we provide the expression of the same metric for fixed and known
number of targets when vector notation is used."
"In this work we propose an approximate Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE)
filter for linear dynamic systems with Gaussian Mixture noise. The proposed
estimator tracks each component of the Gaussian Mixture (GM) posterior with an
individual filter and minimizes the trace of the covariance matrix of the bank
of filters, as opposed to minimizing the MSE of individual filters in the
commonly used Gaussian sum filter (GSF). Hence, the spread of means in the
proposed method is smaller than that of GSF which makes it more robust to
removing components. Consequently, lower complexity reduction schemes can be
used with the proposed filter without losing estimation accuracy and precision.
This is supported through simulations on synthetic data as well as experimental
data related to an indoor localization system. Additionally, we show that in
two limit cases the state estimation provided by our proposed method converges
to that of GSF, and we provide simulation results supporting this in other
cases."
"This paper presents a systematic approach to the design of a robust dynamic
state feedback controller using copies of the plant nonlinearities, which is
based on the use of IQCs and minimax LQR control. The approach combines a
linear state feedback guaranteed cost controller and copies of the plant
nonlinearities to form a robust nonlinear controller."
"We present two nonparametric approaches to Kullback-Leibler (KL) control, or
linearly-solvable Markov decision problem (LMDP) based on Gaussian processes
(GP) and Nystr\""{o}m approximation. Compared to recently developed parametric
methods, the proposed data-driven frameworks feature accurate function
approximation and efficient on-line operations. Theoretically, we derive the
mathematical connection of KL control based on dynamic programming with earlier
work in control theory which relies on information theoretic dualities for the
infinite time horizon case. Algorithmically, we give explicit optimal control
policies in nonparametric forms, and propose on-line update schemes with
budgeted computational costs. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness
and usefulness of the proposed frameworks."
"The linearization of nonlinear systems is an important digital enhancement
technique. In this paper, a real-time capable post- and pre-linearization
method for the widely applicable time-varying discrete-time Volterra series is
presented. To this end, an alternative view on the Volterra series is
established, which enables the utilization of certain modified linear iterative
methods for linearization. For one particular linear iterative method, the
Richardson iteration, the corresponding post- and pre-linearizers are discussed
in detail. It is motivated that the resulting algorithm can be regarded as a
generalization of some existing methods. Furthermore, a simply verifiable
condition for convergence is presented, which allows the straightforward
evaluation of applicability. The proposed method is demonstrated by means of
the linearization of a time-varying nonlinear amplifier, which highlights its
capability of linearizing significantly distorted signals, illustrates the
advantageous convergence behavior, and depicts its robustness against modeling
errors."
"Introduction. To assess the freshness of various products are often used
measuring impedance module. But due to the structure of plant foods diagnostic
value should have exactly a complex component of impedance. Article tasked with
developing criteria for assessing the functional state of the products subject
to a comprehensive component of the impedance. Research methodology. To
determine the functional status of the fruit were measured module and phase of
impedance at the three frequencies of 20, 100 and 500 kHz. Criteria for
recognition of functional status determined by the dynamics of changes in the
parameters of the complex impedance due to destructive processes caused by
dehydration and putrefaction processes. Data processing and analysis. On the
basis of experimental data obtained at three frequencies modeled frequency and
phase response and their changes during losing of freshness and appearance of
destructive processes. Discussion and conclusions. In fresh and stale fruit
modulus and phase of the impedance at low and high frequencies have
characteristic differences. But this is especially evident on the
phase-frequency characteristic, which can be seen that the value of the phase
with the loss of freshness at low frequency decreases and increases at high
more than twice during one week. Therefore, to assess the functional state of
fresh and stale products we suggest use phase portraits of phase response."
"We introduce StoDynProg, a small library created to solve Optimal Control
problems arising in the management of Renewable Power Sources, in particular
when coupled with an Energy Storage System. The library implements generic
Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) numerical methods which can solve a large
class of Dynamic Optimization problems. We demonstrate the library capabilities
with a prototype problem: smoothing the power of an Ocean Wave Energy
Converter. First we use time series analysis to derive a stochastic Markovian
model of this system since it is required by Dynamic Programming. Then, we
briefly describe the ""policy iteration"" algorithm we have implemented and the
numerical tools being used. We show how the API design of the library is
generic enough to address Dynamic Optimization problems outside the field of
Energy Management. Finally, we solve the power smoothing problem and compare
the optimal control with a simpler heuristic control."
"The diffusion LMS algorithm has been extensively studied in recent years.
This efficient strategy allows to address distributed optimization problems
over networks in the case where nodes have to collaboratively estimate a single
parameter vector. Problems of this type are referred to as single-task
problems. Nevertheless, there are several problems in practice that are
multitask-oriented in the sense that the optimum parameter vector may not be
the same for every node. This brings up the issue of studying the performance
of the diffusion LMS algorithm when it is run, either intentionally or
unintentionally, in a multitask environment. In this paper, we conduct a
theoretical analysis on the stochastic behavior of diffusion LMS in the case
where the so-called single-task hypothesis is violated. We explain under what
conditions diffusion LMS continues to deliver performance superior to
non-cooperative strategies in the multitask environment. When the conditions
are violated, we explain how to endow the nodes with the ability to cluster
with other similar nodes to remove bias. We propose an unsupervised clustering
strategy that allows each node to select, via adaptive adjustments of
combination weights, the neighboring nodes with which it can collaborate to
estimate a common parameter vector. Simulations are presented to illustrate the
theoretical results, and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
clustering strategy. The framework is applied to a useful problem involving a
multi-target tracking task."
"Motivated by the fact that transfer functions do not contain structural
information about networks, dynamical structure functions were introduced to
capture causal relationships between measured nodes in networks. From the
dynamical structure functions, a) we show that the actual number of hidden
states can be larger than the number of hidden states estimated from the
corresponding transfer function; b) we can obtain partial information about the
true state-space equation, which cannot in general be obtained from the
transfer function. Based on these properties, this paper proposes algorithms to
find minimal realisations for a given dynamical structure function. This helps
to estimate the minimal number of hidden states, to better understand the
complexity of the network, and to identify potential targets for new
measurements."
"The problem of finding a finite state symbolic model which is bisimilar to a
hybrid dynamical system (HDS) and has the minimum number of states is
considered. The considered class of HDS allows for discrete-valued inputs that
only affect the jumps (events) of the HDS. Representation of the HDS in the
form of a transition system is revisited in comparison with prior works. An
algorithm is proposed for solving the problem which gives the bisimulation with
the minimum number of states if it already exists and also a parameter of the
algorithm is properly tuned. There is no need for stability assumptions and no
time discretization is applied. The results are applied to an example"
"Gait velocity has been consistently shown to be an important indicator and
predictor of health status, especially in older adults. Gait velocity is often
assessed clinically, but the assessments occur infrequently and thus do not
allow optimal detection of key health changes when they occur. In this paper,
we show the time it takes a person to move between rooms in their home denoted
'transition times' can predict gait velocity when estimated from passive
infrared motion detectors installed in a patient's own home. Using a support
vector regression approach to model the relationship between transition times
and gait velocities, we show that velocity can be predicted with an average
error less than 2.5 cm/sec. This is demonstrated with data collected over a 5
year period from 74 older adults monitored in their own homes. This method is
simple and cost effective, and has advantages over competing approaches such
as: obtaining 20 to100x more gait velocity measurements per day, and offering
the fusion of location specific information with time stamped gait estimates.
These advantages allow stable estimates of gait parameters (maximum or average
speed, variability) at shorter time scales than current approaches. This also
provides a pervasive in home method for context aware gait velocity sensing
that allows for monitoring of gait trajectories in space and time."
"We present a procedure for reducing the number of continuous states of
discrete-time linear switched systems, such that the reduced system has the
same behavior as the original system for a subset of switching sequences. The
proposed method is expected to be useful for abstraction based control
synthesis methods for hybrid systems."
"Analysis of transient stability of strongly nonlinear post-fault dynamics is
one of the most computationally challenging parts of Dynamic Security
Assessment. This paper proposes a novel approach for assessment of transient
stability of the system. The approach generalizes the idea of energy methods,
and extends the concept of energy function to a more general Lyapunov Functions
Family (LFF) constructed via Semi-Definite-Programming techniques. Unlike the
traditional energy function and its variations, the constructed Lyapunov
functions are proven to be decreasing only in a finite neighborhood of the
equilibrium point. However, we show that they can still certify stability of a
broader set of initial conditions in comparison to the traditional energy
function in the closest-UEP method. Moreover, the certificates of stability can
be constructed via a sequence of convex optimization problems that are
tractable even for large scale systems. We also propose specific algorithms for
adaptation of the Lyapunov functions to specific initial conditions and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a number of IEEE test cases."
"In this paper consensus in second-order multi-agent systems with a
non-periodic sampled-data exchange among agents is investigated. The sampling
is random with bounded inter-sampling intervals. It is assumed that each agent
has exact knowledge of its own state at any time instant. The considered local
interaction rule is PD-type. Sufficient conditions for stability of the
consensus protocol to a time-invariant value are derived based on LMIs. Such
conditions only require the knowledge of the connectivity of the graph modeling
the network topology. Numerical simulations are presented to corroborate the
theoretical results."
"This paper continues the study of local detectability and observability
requirements on components of distributed observers networks to ensure
detectability properties of the network. First, we present a sketch of an
elementary proof of the known result equating the multiplicity of the zero
eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix of a digraph to the number of its maximal
reachable subgraphs. Unlike the existing algebraic proof, we use a direct
analysis of the graph topology. This result is then used in the second part of
the paper to extend our previous results which connect the detectability of an
observer network with corresponding local detectability and observability
properties of its node observers. The proposed extension allows for
nonidentical matrices to be used in the interconnections."
"In this work we study the problem of adaptive MPC for linear time-invariant
uncertain models. We assume linear models with parametric uncertainties, and
propose an iterative multi-variable extremum seeking (MES)-based learning MPC
algorithm to learn on-line the uncertain parameters and update the MPC model.
We show the effectiveness of this algorithm on a DC servo motor control
example."
"We study in this paper the problem of iterative feedback gains tuning for a
class of nonlinear systems. We consider Input-Output linearizable nonlinear
systems with additive uncertainties. We first design a nominal Input-Output
linearization-based controller that ensures global uniform boundedness of the
output tracking error dynamics. Then, we complement the robust controller with
a model-free multi-parametric extremum seeking (MES) control to iteratively
auto-tune the feedback gains. We analyze the stability of the whole controller,
i.e. robust nonlinear controller plus model-free learning algorithm. We use
numerical tests to demonstrate the performance of this method on a mechatronics
example."
"In this paper we present a framework to efficiently characterize the
available operational flexibility in a multi-area power system. We focus on the
available reserves and the tie-line flows. The proposed approach is an
alternative to the current calculation of the Available Transfer Capacity
(ATC), as it considers location and availability of reserves, transmission
constraints, and interdependencies of tie-line flows between different areas,
while it takes into account the N-1 security criterion. The method is based on
computational geometry using polytopic projections. It requires only a limited
amount of information exchange and does not need central coordination. The
method has two versions: a passive and an active approach, where neighboring
areas can share reserves. In that respect we also introduce the term ""exported
flexibility"", which could form the basis for a new trading product in
electricity markets. Case studies demonstrate the improved tie-line
utilization, especially if reserves are shared, and the visualization benefits."
"Almost sure asymptotic stabilization of a discrete-time switched stochastic
system is investigated. Information on the active operation mode of the
switched system is assumed to be available for control purposes only at random
time instants. We propose a stabilizing feedback control framework that
utilizes the information obtained through mode observations. We first consider
the case where stochastic properties of mode observation instants are fully
known. We obtain sufficient asymptotic stabilization conditions for the
closed-loop switched stochastic system under our proposed control law. We then
explore the case where exact knowledge of the stochastic properties of mode
observation instants is not available. We present a set of alternative
stabilization conditions for this case. The results for both cases are
predicated on the analysis of a sequence-valued process that encapsulates the
stochastic nature of the evolution of active operation mode between mode
observation instants. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our results with
numerical examples."
"Energy harvesting based on tethered kites benefits from exploiting higher
wind speeds at higher altitudes. The setup considered in this paper is based on
a pumping cycle. It generates energy by winching out at high tether forces,
driving an electrical generator while flying crosswind. Then it winches in at a
stationary neutral position, thus leaving a net amount of generated energy.
  The focus of this paper is put on the flight control design, which implements
an accurate direction control towards target points and allows for a flight
with an eight-down pattern. An extended overview on the control system
approach, as well as details of each element of the flight controller, are
presented. The control architecture is motivated by a simple, yet comprehensive
model for the kite dynamics.
  In addition, winch strategies based on an optimization scheme are presented.
In order to demonstrate the real world functionality of the presented
algorithms, flight data from a fully automated pumping-cycle operation of a
small-scale prototype are given. The setup is based on a 30m$^2$ kite linked to
a ground-based 50kW electrical motor/generator by a single line."
"Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large number of states are of high
practical interest. However, conventional algorithms to solve MDP are
computationally infeasible in this scenario. Approximate dynamic programming
(ADP) methods tackle this issue by computing approximate solutions. A widely
applied ADP method is approximate linear program (ALP) which makes use of
linear function approximation and offers theoretical performance guarantees.
Nevertheless, the ALP is difficult to solve due to the presence of a large
number of constraints and in practice, a reduced linear program (RLP) is solved
instead. The RLP has a tractable number of constraints sampled from the
original constraints of the ALP. Though the RLP is known to perform well in
experiments the theoretical guarantees are available only for a specific RLP
obtained under idealized assumptions.
  In this paper, we generalize the RLP to define a generalized reduced linear
program (GRLP) which has a tractable number of constraints that are obtained as
positive linear combinations of the original constraints of the ALP. The main
contribution of this paper is the novel theoretical framework developed to
obtain error bounds for any given GRLP. Central to our framework are two
$\max$-norm contraction operators. Our result solves theoretically justifies
linear approximation of constraints. We discuss the implication of our results
in the contexts of ADP and reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate via an
example in the domain of controlled queues that the experiments conform to the
theory."
"We present a method for generating robust chaos. It is based on the search
algorithm weak symmetry violation in the reconstructed attractor. On its basis
the smooth functions in the form of a system of finite-difference equations. To
ensure robust chaos generator introduced piecewise continuous member. The
simulation results are given in the report."
"It is perhaps not widely recognized that certain common notions of distance
between probability measures have an alternative dual interpretation which
compares corresponding functionals against suitable families of test functions.
This dual viewpoint extends in a straightforward manner to suggest metrics
between matrix-valued measures. Our main interest has been in developing
weakly-continuous metrics that are suitable for comparing matrix-valued power
spectral density functions. To this end, and following the suggested recipe of
utilizing suitable families of test functions, we develop a weakly-continuous
metric that is analogous to the Wasserstein metric and applies to matrix-valued
densities. We use a numerical example to compare this metric to certain
standard alternatives including a different version of a matricial Wasserstein
metric developed earlier."
"Boolean networks are used to model biological networks such as gene
regulatory networks. Often Boolean networks show very chaotic behavior which is
sensitive to any small perturbations.In order to reduce the chaotic behavior
and to attain stability in the gene regulatory network,nested canalizing
functions(NCF)are best suited NCF and its variants have a wide range of
applications in system biology. Previously many work were done on the
application of canalizing functions but there were fewer methods to check if
any arbitrary Boolean function is canalizing or not. In this paper, by using
Karnaugh Map this problem gas been solved and also it has been shown that when
the canalizing functions of n variable is given, all the canalizing functions
of n+1 variable could be generated by the method of concatenation. In this
paper we have uniquely identified the number of NCFs having a particular
hamming distance (H.D) generated by each variable x as starting canalizing
input. Partially nested canalizing functions of 4 variables have also been
studied in this paper. Keywords: Karnaugh Map, Canalizing function, Nested
canalizing function, Partially nested canalizing function,concatenation"
"Energy conservation is a key factor towards long term energy sustainability.
Real-time end user energy feedback, using disaggregated electric load
composition, can play a pivotal role in motivating consumers towards energy
conservation. Recent works have explored using high frequency conducted
electromagnetic interference (EMI) on power lines as a single point sensing
parameter for monitoring common home appliances. However, key questions
regarding the reliability and feasibility of using EMI signatures for
non-intrusive load monitoring over multiple appliances across different sensing
paradigms remain unanswered. This work presents some of the key challenges
towards using EMI as a unique and time invariant feature for load
disaggregation. In-depth empirical evaluations of a large number of appliances
in different sensing configurations are carried out, in both laboratory and
real world settings. Insights into the effects of external parameters such as
line impedance, background noise and appliance coupling on the EMI behavior of
an appliance are realized through simulations and measurements. A generic
approach for simulating the EMI behavior of an appliance that can then be used
to do a detailed analysis of real world phenomenology is presented. The
simulation approach is validated with EMI data from a router. Our EMI dataset -
High Frequency EMI Dataset (HFED) is also released."
"We consider joint control of a switchable capacitor and a D-STATCOM for
voltage regulation in a distribution circuit with intermittent load. The
control problem is formulated as a two-timescale optimal power flow problem
with chance constraints, which minimizes power loss while limiting the
probability of voltage violations due to fast changes in load. The control
problem forms the basis of an optimization problem which determines the sizes
of the control devices by minimizing sum of the expected power loss cost and
the capital cost. We develop computationally efficient heuristics to solve the
optimal sizing problem and implement real-time control. Numerical experiments
on a circuit with high-performance computing (HPC) load show that the proposed
sizing and control schemes significantly improve the reliability of voltage
regulation on the expense of only a moderate increase in cost."
"In this paper we present an extension of the classical Root-Locus (RL) method
where the points are calculated in the real projective plane instead of the
conventional affine real plane; we denominate this extension of the Root-Locus
as ""Projective Root-Locus (PjRL)"". To plot the PjRL we use the concept of
""Gnomonic Projection"" in order to have a representation of the projective real
plane as a simi-sphere of radius one in ${\mathbb R}^3$. We will see that the
PjRL reduces to the RL in the affine $XY$ plane, but also we can plot the RL
onto another affine component of the projective plane, like $ZY$ affine plane
for instance, to obtain what we denominate complementary plots of the
conventional RL. We also show that with the PjRL the points at infinity of the
RL can be computed as solutions of a set algebraic equations."
"We consider platoons composed of identical vehicles and controlled in a
distributed way, that is, each vehicle has its own onboard controller. The
regulation errors in spacing to the immediately preceeding and following
vehicles are weighted differently by the onboard controller, which thus
implements an asymmetric bidirectional control scheme. The weights can vary
along the platoon. We prove that such platoons have a nonzero uniform bound on
the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix - the Fiedler
eigenvalue. Furthermore, it is shown that existence of this bound always
signals undesirable scaling properties of the platoon. Namely, the H-infinity
norm of the transfer function of the platoon grows exponentially with the
number of vehicles regardless of the controllers used. Hence the benefits of a
uniform gap in the spectrum of a Laplacian with an asymetric distributed
controller are paid for by poor scaling as the number of vehicles grows."
"In this paper we study theoretical properties of inverter-based microgrids
controlled via primary and secondary loops. Stability of these microgrids has
been the subject of a number of recent studies. Conventional approaches based
on standard hierarchical control rely on time-scale separation between primary
and secondary control loops to show local stability of equilibria. In this
paper we show that (i) frequency regulation can be ensured without assuming
time-scale separation and, (ii) ultimate boundedness of the trajectories
starting inside a region of the state space can be guaranteed under a condition
on the inverters power injection errors. The trajectory ultimate bound can be
computed by simple iterations of a nonlinear mapping and provides a certificate
of the overall performance of the controlled microgrid."
"The paper addresses the problem of distributed filtering with guaranteed
convergence properties using minimum-energy filtering and $H_\infty$ filtering
methodologies. A linear state space plant model is considered observed by a
network of communicating sensors, in which individual sensor measurements may
lead to an unobservable filtering problem. However, each filter locally shares
estimates, that are subject to disturbances, with its respective neighboring
filters to produce an estimate of the plant state. The minimum-energy strategy
of the proposed local filter leads to a locally optimal time-varying filter
gain facilitating the transient and the asymptotic convergence of the
estimation error, with guaranteed $H_\infty$ performance. The filters are
implementable using only the local measurements and information from the
neighboring filters subject to disturbances. A key idea of the proposed
algorithm is to locally approximate the neighboring estimates, that are not
directly accessible, considering them as disturbance contaminated versions of
the plant state. The proposed algorithm imposes minimal communication load on
the network and is scalable to larger sensor networks."
"Residential Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) such as Air Conditioners
(ACs), heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators have an enormous thermal
storage potential for providing regulation reserve to the grid. In this paper,
we study the potential resource and economic analysis of TCLs providing
frequency regulation service. In particular, we show that the potential
resource of TCLs in California is more than enough for both current and
predicted near-future regulation requirements for the California power system.
Moreover, we estimate the cost and revenue of TCLs, discuss the qualification
requirements, recommended policy changes, and participation incentive methods,
and compare TCLs with other energy storage technologies. We show that TCLs are
potentially more cost-effective than other energy storage technologies such as
flywheels, Li-ion, advanced lead acid, and Zinc Bromide batteries."
"We propose to synthesize a control policy for a Markov decision process (MDP)
such that the resulting traces of the MDP satisfy a linear temporal logic (LTL)
property. We construct a product MDP that incorporates a deterministic Rabin
automaton generated from the desired LTL property. The reward function of the
product MDP is defined from the acceptance condition of the Rabin automaton.
This construction allows us to apply techniques from learning theory to the
problem of synthesis for LTL specifications even when the transition
probabilities are not known a priori. We prove that our method is guaranteed to
find a controller that satisfies the LTL property with probability one if such
a policy exists, and we suggest empirically with a case study in traffic
control that our method produces reasonable control strategies even when the
LTL property cannot be satisfied with probability one."
"This paper presents a consensus algorithm for a multi-agent system where each
agent has access to its imperfect own state and neighboring state measurements.
The measurements are subject to deterministic disturbances and the proposed
algorithm provides a minimum-energy estimate of the measured states which is
instrumental in achieving consensus by the nodes. It is shown that the proposed
consensus algorithm converges exponentially in the absence of disturbances, and
its performance under bounded continuous disturbances is investigated as well.
The convergence performance of the proposed method is further studied using
simulations where we show that consensus is achieved despite using large
measurement errors."
"This paper addresses the distributed consensus problem for a linear
multi-agent system with switching directed communication topologies. By
appropriately introducing a linear transformation, the consensus problem is
equivalently converted to a stabilization problem for a class of switched
linear systems. Some sufficient consensus conditions are then derived by using
tools from the matrix theory and stability analysis of switched systems. It is
proved that consensus in such a multi-agent system can be ensured if each agent
is stabilizable and each possible directed topology contains a directed
spanning tree. Finally, a numerical simulation is given for illustration."
"Airborne wind energy systems aim to harvest the power of winds blowing at
altitudes higher than what conventional wind turbines reach. They employ a
tethered flying structure, usually a wing, and exploit the aerodynamic lift to
produce electrical power. In the case of ground-based systems, where the
traction force on the tether is used to drive a generator on the ground, a two
phase power cycle is carried out: one phase to produce power, where the tether
is reeled out under high traction force, and a second phase where the tether is
recoiled under minimal load. The problem of controlling a tethered wing in this
second phase, the retraction phase, is addressed here, by proposing two
possible control strategies. Theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and
experimental results are presented to show the performance of the two
approaches. Finally, the experimental results of complete autonomous power
generation cycles are reported and compared with first-principle models."
"We propose a macroscopic traffic network flow model suitable for analysis as
a dynamical system, and we qualitatively analyze equilibrium flows as well as
convergence. Flows at a junction are determined by downstream supply of
capacity as well as upstream demand of traffic wishing to flow through the
junction. This approach is rooted in the celebrated Cell Transmission Model for
freeway traffic flow. Unlike related results which rely on certain system
cooperativity properties, our model generally does not possess these
properties. We show that the lack of cooperativity is in fact a useful feature
that allows traffic control methods, such as ramp metering, to be effective.
Finally, we leverage the results of the paper to develop a linear program for
optimal ramp metering."
"In this paper, we present a Fingerprint Linear Estimation Routine (FLiER) to
identify topology changes in power networks using readings from
sparsely-deployed phasor measurement units (PMUs). When a power line, load, or
generator trips in a network, or when a substation is reconfigured, the event
leaves a unique ""voltage fingerprint"" of bus voltage changes that we can
identify using only the portion of the network directly observed by the PMUs.
The naive brute-force approach to identify a failed line from such voltage
fingerprints, though simple and accurate, is slow. We derive an approximate
algorithm based on a local linearization and a novel filtering approach that is
faster and only slightly less accurate. We present experimental results using
the IEEE 57-bus, IEEE 118-bus, and Polish 1999-2000 winter peak networks."
"Electrical energy production based on wind power has become the most popular
renewable resources in the recent years because it gets reliable clean energy
with minimum cost. The major challenge for wind turbines is the electrical and
the mechanical failures which can occur at any time causing prospective
breakdowns and damages and therefore it leads to machine downtimes and to
energy production loss. To circumvent this problem, several tools and
techniques have been developed and used to enhance fault detection and
diagnosis to be found in the stator current signature for wind turbines
generators. Among these methods, parametric or super-resolution frequency
estimation methods, which provides typical spectrum estimation, can be useful
for this purpose. Facing on the plurality of these algorithms, a comparative
performance analysis is made to evaluate robustness based on different metrics:
accuracy, dispersion, computation cost, perturbations and faults severity.
Finally, simulation results in MATLAB with most occurring faults indicate that
ESPRIT and R-MUSIC algorithms have high capability of correctly identifying the
frequencies of fault characteristic components, a performance ranking had been
carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the studied methods in faults
detecting."
"We extend the results of the general small-gain theorem proposed by Z.P
Jiang. The significance of this extension is two fold. First, it allows one to
use general vector norm to characterize the input-to-output property of two
interconnected subsystems. Second, the gain from input signals to output of
each sub-system is provided, which offers one more flexibility in control
design."
"The integration of renewable generation poses operational and economic
challenges for the electricity grid. For the core problem of power balance, the
legacy paradigm of tailoring supply to follow random demand may be
inappropriate under deep penetration of uncertain and intermittent renewable
generation. In this situation, there is an emerging consensus that the
alternative approach of controlling demand to follow random supply offers
compelling economic benefits in terms of reduced regulation costs. This
approach exploits the flexibility of demand side resources and requires
sensing, actuation, and communication infrastructure; distributed control
algorithms; and viable schemes to compensate participating loads. This paper
considers rate-constrained energy services which are a specific paradigm for
flexible demand. These services are characterized by a specified delivery
window, the total amount of energy that must be supplied over this window, and
the maximum rate at which this energy may be delivered. We consider a forward
market where rate-constrained energy services are traded. We explore allocation
policies and market decisions of a supplier in this market. The supplier owns a
generation mix that includes some uncertain renewable generation and may also
purchase energy in day-ahead and real-time markets to meet customer demand. The
supplier must optimally select the portfolio of rate-constrained services to
sell, the amount of day-ahead energy to buy, and the policies for making
real-time energy purchases and allocations to customers to maximize its
expected profit. We offer solutions to the supplier's decision and control
problems to economically provide rate constrained energy services."
"Interaction graphs provide an important qualitative modeling approach for
System Biology. This paper presents a novel approach for construction of
interaction graph with the help of Boolean function decomposition. Each
decomposition part (Consisting of 2-bits) of the Boolean functions has some
important significance. In the dynamics of a biological system, each variable
or node is nothing but gene or protein. Their regulation has been explored in
terms of interaction graphs which are generated by Boolean functions. In this
paper, different classes of Boolean functions with regards to Interaction Graph
with biologically significant properties have been adumbrated."
"A robust entry guidance law without drag rate measurement is designed for
drag-tracking in this paper. The bank angle is regarded as the control
variable. First, a state feedback guidance law (bank angle magnitude) that
requires the drag and its rate as feedback information is designed to make the
drag-tracking error be input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to
uncertainties. Then a high gain observer is utilized to estimate the drag rate
which is difficult for a vehicle to measure accurately in practice. Stability
analysis as well as simulation results show the efficiency of the presented
approach."
"In this paper we investigate how the equilibrium characteristics of
conventional power systems may change with an increase in wind penetration. We
first derive a differential-algebraic model of a power system network
consisting of synchronous generators, loads and a wind power plant modeled by a
wind turbine and a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The models of these
three components are coupled via nonlinear power flow equations. In contrast to
the traditional approach for solving the power flows via iterative methods that
often lead to only local solutions, we apply a recently developed
parameter-homotopy based numerical continuation algorithm to compute all
possible solutions. The method solves the power flow equations over multiple
values of the wind penetration level with far less computational effort instead
of solving them at each value individually. We observe that depending on the
penetration limit and the setpoint value for the magnitude of the wind bus
voltage, the system may exhibit several undesired or even unstable equilibria.
We illustrate these results through a detailed simulation of a 5-machine power
system model with wind injection, and highlight how the solutions may be
helpful for small-signal stability assessment."
"Nowadays, Linux file systems have to manage millions of tiny files for
different applications, and face with higher metadata operations. So how to
provide such high metadata performance with such enormous number of files and
large scale directories is a big challenge for Linux file system. We viewed
that metadata lookup operations dominate metadata workload and incur low
metadata performance. In this paper, we present a metadata cache to accelerate
metadata access for Linux file system. Through this optimization, the Linux
file system (such as EXT2, EXT4, BTRFS, etc.) can gain improvement in read
rates as well as write rates."
"We consider continuous-time consensus systems whose interactions satisfy a
form or reciprocity that is not instantaneous, but happens over time. We show
that these systems have certain desirable properties: They always converge
independently of the specific interactions taking place and there exist simple
conditions on the interactions for two agents to converge to the same value.
This was until now only known for systems with instantaneous reciprocity. These
result are of particular relevance when analyzing systems where interactions
are a priori unknown, being for example endogenously determined or random. We
apply our results to an instance of such systems."
"This paper considers the distributed computation of confidence regions
tethered to multidimensional parameter estimation under linear measurement
models. In particular, the considered confidence regions are non-asymptotic,
this meaning that the number of required measurements is finite. Distributed
solutions for the computation of non-asymptotic confidence regions are
proposed, suited to wireless sensor networks scenarios. Their performances are
compared in terms of required traffic load, both analytically and numerically.
The evidence emerging from the conducted investigations is that the best
solution for information exchange depends on whether the network topology is
structured or unstructured. The effect on the computation of confidence regions
of information diffusion truncation is also examined. In particular, it is
proven that consistent confidence regions can be computed even when an
incomplete set of measurements is available."
"Satellite power system is a complex, highly interconnected hybrid system that
exhibit nonlinear and mode switching behaviors. Directed factor graph is an
inference model for fault diagnosis using probabilistic reasoning techniques. A
novel approach for constructing the directed factor graph structure based on
hybrid bond graph model is proposed. The system components status and their
fault symptoms are treated as hypothesis and evidences respectively. The
cause-effect relations between hypothesis and evidences are identified and
concluded though qualitative equations and causal path analysis on hybrid bond
graph model. A power supply module of a satellite power system is provided as
case study to show the feasibility and validity of the proposed method."
"This paper proposes a method for abstracting control systems by timed game
automata, and is aimed at obtaining automatic controller synthesis.
  The proposed abstraction is based on partitioning the state space of a
control system using positive and negative invariant sets, generated by
Lyapunov functions. This partitioning ensures that the vector field of the
control system is transversal to the facets of the cells, which induces some
desirable properties of the abstraction. To allow a rich class of control
systems to be abstracted, the update maps of the timed game automaton are
extended.
  Conditions on the partitioning of the state space and the control are set up
to obtain sound abstractions. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate
the method applied to a control problem related to navigation."
"Development of robust dynamical systems and networks such as autonomous
aircraft systems capable of accomplishing complex missions faces challenges due
to the dynamically evolving uncertainties coming from model uncertainties,
necessity to operate in a hostile cluttered urban environment, and the
distributed and dynamic nature of the communication and computation resources.
Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid
dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of
computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview
recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust
autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on
efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies
of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory
planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is
generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples
of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of
energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power
networks."
"In this paper, we improve iterative greedy search algorithms in which atoms
are selected serially over iterations, i.e., one-by-one over iterations. For
serial atom selection, we devise two new schemes to select an atom from a set
of potential atoms in each iteration. The two new schemes lead to two new
algorithms. For both the algorithms, in each iteration, the set of potential
atoms is found using a standard matched filter. In case of the first scheme, we
propose an orthogonal projection strategy that selects an atom from the set of
potential atoms. Then, for the second scheme, we propose a look ahead strategy
such that the selection of an atom in the current iteration has an effect on
the future iterations. The use of look ahead strategy requires a higher
computational resource. To achieve a trade-off between performance and
complexity, we use the two new schemes in cascade and develop a third new
algorithm. Through experimental evaluations, we compare the proposed algorithms
with existing greedy search and convex relaxation algorithms."
"While service-dominant logic proposes that all ""Goods are a distribution
mechanism for service provision"" (FP3), there is a need to understand when and
why a firm would utilise direct or indirect (goods) service provision, and the
interactions between them, to co-create value with the customer. Three
longitudinal case studies in B2B equipment-based 'complex service' systems were
analysed to gain an understanding of customers' co-creation activities to
achieve outcomes. We found the nature of value, degree of contextual variety
and the firm's legacy viability to be viability threats. To counter this, the
firm uses (a) Direct Service Provision for Scalability and Replicability, (b)
Indirect Service Provision for variety absorption and co-creating emotional
value and customer experience and (c) designing direct and indirect provision
for Scalability and Absorptive Resources of the customer. The co-creation of
complex multidimensional value could be delivered through different value
propositions of the firm. The research proposes a value-centric way of
understanding the interactions between direct and indirect service provision in
the design of the firm's value proposition and proposes a viable systems
approach towards reorganising the firm. The study provides a way for managers
to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of the firm in
co-creating value as a major issue in the design of complex socio-technical
systems. Goods are often designed within the domain of engineering and product
design, often placing human activity as a supporting role to the equipment.
Through an SDLogic lens, this study considers the design of both equipment and
human activity on an equal footing for value co-creation with the customer, and
it yielded interesting results on when direct provisioning (goods) should be
redesigned, considering all activities equally."
"This editorial introduces the special issue of the Springer journal, Journal
of Intelligent Manufacturing, on intelligent distributed production control.
This special issue contains selected papers presented at the 13th IFAC
Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing - INCOM'2009

"Usually, the dynamics of linear time-invariant systems described by an
integral operator of convolution type, which is defined in the Hilbert space of
Lebesgue square integrable functions on the whole line. Such a description
leads to contradictions. It is shown that the transition to the Hilbert space
of almost periodic functions leads to the elimination of the detected
inconsistencies. Multiple signals and interference with discrete spectrum are
systems of sets. The properties of these systems lead to a new more effective
method to combat noise in this space. The method used to identify the
differential equations for the airbus. Baseline data were obtained during
automatic landing."
"The Stacker Crane Problem is NP-Hard and the best known approximation
algorithm only provides a 9/5 approximation ratio. The objective of this paper
is threefold. First, by embedding the problem within a stochastic framework, we
present a novel algorithm for the SCP that: (i) is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the
number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; and (ii) has computational
complexity $O(n^{2+\eps})$, where $n$ is the number of pickup/delivery pairs
and $\eps$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. Second, we asymptotically
characterize the length of the optimal SCP tour. Finally, we study a dynamic
version of the SCP, whereby pickup and delivery requests arrive according to a
Poisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale demand-responsive
transport (DRT) systems. For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing
policies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic
distributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and
the number of vehicles. Our results leverage a novel connection between the
Euclidean Bipartite Matching Problem and the theory of random permutations,
and, for the dynamic setting, exhibit novel features that are absent in
traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems."
"Symbolic models have been recently used as a sound mathematical formalism for
the formal verification and control design of purely continuous and hybrid
systems. In this paper we propose a sequence of symbolic models that
approximates a discrete-time Piecewise Affine (PWA) system in the sense of
approximate simulation and converges to the PWA system in the so-called
simulation metric. Symbolic control design is then addressed with
specifications expressed in terms of non-deterministic finite automata. A
sequence of symbolic control strategies is derived which converges, in the
sense of simulation metric, to the maximal controller solving the given
specification on the PWA system."
"The regulation by sliding mode control (SMC) is recognized for its qualities
of robustness and dynamic response. This article will briefly talk about the
regulation principles by sliding mode as well as the application of this
approach to the adjustment of a speed control DC motor bench using the TY36A/EV
unit. This unit, from Electronica Veneta products, uses a PID controller to
control the speed and position of the DC motor. Our purpose is to improve the
set time answer and the robustness of the system when disturbances take place.
The experimental results show very good performances of the proposed approach
relatively to the PID."
"Position and speed control of the torpedo present a real problem for the
actuators because of the high level of the system non linearity and because of
the external disturbances. The non linear systems control is based on several
different approaches, among it the sliding mode control. The sliding mode
control has proved its effectiveness through the different studies. The
advantage that makes such an important approach is its robustness versus the
disturbances and the model uncertainties. However, this approach implies a
disadvantage which is the chattering phenomenon caused by the discontinuous
part of this control and which can have a harmful effect on the actuators. This
paper deals with the basic concepts, mathematics, and design aspects of a
control for nonlinear systems that make the chattering effect lower. As
solution to this problem we will adopt as a starting point the high order
sliding mode approaches then the PID sliding surface. Simulation results show
that this control strategy can attain excellent control performance with no
chattering problem."
"In this paper we present the basic features of the flight control of the
SkySails towing kite system. After introduction of coordinate definitions and
basic system dynamics we introduce a novel model used for controller design and
justify its main dynamics with results from system identification based on
numerous sea trials. We then present the controller design which we
successfully use for operational flights for several years. Finally we explain
the generation of dynamical flight patterns."
"Frequency Estimation of a complex exponential is a problem relevant to a
large number of fields. In this paper a computationally efficient and accurate
frequency estimator is presented using the guaranteed stable Sliding DFT which
gives stability as well as computational efficiency. The estimator approaches
Jacobsen's estimator and Candan's estimator for large N with an extra
correction term multiplied to it for the stabilization of the sliding DFT.
Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed estimator were
found to be better than Jacobsen's estimator and Candan's estimator."
"A key objective of the smart grid is to improve reliability of utility
services to end users. This requires strengthening resilience of distribution
networks that lie at the edge of the grid. However, distribution networks are
exposed to external disturbances such as hurricanes and snow storms where
electricity service to customers is disrupted repeatedly. External disturbances
cause large-scale power failures that are neither well-understood, nor
formulated rigorously, nor studied systematically. This work studies resilience
of power distribution networks to large-scale disturbances in three aspects.
First, a non-stationary random process is derived to characterize an entire
life cycle of large-scale failure and recovery. Second, resilience is defined
based on the non-stationary random process. Close form analytical expressions
are derived under specific large-scale failure scenarios. Third, the
non-stationary model and the resilience metric are applied to a real life
example of large-scale disruptions due to Hurricane Ike. Real data on
large-scale failures from an operational network is used to learn time-varying
model parameters and resilience metrics."
"Phase curve of an open loop system is flat in nature if the derivative of
phase with respect to frequency is zero. With a flat phase curve, the
corresponding closed-loop system exhibits an iso-damped property i.e. maintains
constant overshoot with the change of gain and with other parametric
variations. In recent past application, fractional order (FO) phase shapers
have been proposed by contemporary researchers to achieve enhanced parametric
robustness. In this paper, a simple Routh tabulation based methodology is
proposed to design an appropriate FO phase shaper to achieve phase flattening
in a control loop, comprising a system, controlled by a classical PID
controller. The method is demonstrated using MATLAB simulation of a second
order DC motor plant and also a first order with time delay system."
"The issues of stochastically varying network delays and packet dropouts in
Networked Control System (NCS) applications have been simultaneously addressed
by time domain optimal tuning of fractional order (FO) PID controllers.
Different variants of evolutionary algorithms are used for the tuning process
and their performances are compared. Also the effectiveness of the fractional
order PI{\lambda}D{\mu} controllers over their integer order counterparts is
looked into. Two standard test bench plants with time delay and unstable poles
which are encountered in process control applications are tuned with the
proposed method to establish the validity of the tuning methodology. The
proposed tuning methodology is independent of the specific choice of plant and
is also applicable for less complicated systems. Thus it is useful in a wide
variety of scenarios. The paper also shows the superiority of FOPID controllers
over their conventional PID counterparts for NCS applications."
"In this paper, a comparative study is done on the time and frequency domain
tuning strategies for fractional order (FO) PID controllers to handle higher
order processes. A new fractional order template for reduced parameter modeling
of stable minimum/non-minimum phase higher order processes is introduced and
its advantage in frequency domain tuning of FOPID controllers is also
presented. The time domain optimal tuning of FOPID controllers have also been
carried out to handle these higher order processes by performing optimization
with various integral performance indices. The paper highlights on the
practical control system implementation issues like flexibility of online
autotuning, reduced control signal and actuator size, capability of measurement
noise filtration, load disturbance suppression, robustness against parameter
uncertainties etc. in light of the above tuning methodologies."
"A novel fractional order (FO) fuzzy Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controller has been proposed in this paper which works on the closed loop error
and its fractional derivative as the input and has a fractional integrator in
its output. The fractional order differ-integrations in the proposed fuzzy
logic controller (FLC) are kept as design variables along with the input-output
scaling factors (SF) and are optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) while
minimizing several integral error indices along with the control signal as the
objective function. Simulations studies are carried out to control a delayed
nonlinear process and an open loop unstable process with time delay. The closed
loop performances and controller efforts in each case are compared with
conventional PID, fuzzy PID and PI{\lambda}D{\mu} controller subjected to
different integral performance indices. Simulation results show that the
proposed fractional order fuzzy PID controller outperforms the others in most

"Bulk reduction of reactor power within a small finite time interval under
abnormal conditions is referred to as step-back. In this paper, a 500MWe
Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) type Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)
is modeled using few variants of Least Square Estimator (LSE) from practical
test data under a control rod drop scenario in order to design a control system
to achieve a dead-beat response during a stepped reduction of its global power.
A new fractional order (FO) model reduction technique is attempted which
increases the parametric robustness of the control loop due to lesser modeling
error and ensures iso-damped closed loop response with a PI{\lambda}D{\mu} or
FOPID controller. Such a controller can, therefore, be used to achieve active
step-back under varying load conditions for which the system dynamics change
significantly. For closed loop active control of the reduced FO reactor models,
the PI{\lambda}D{\mu} controller is shown to perform better than the classical
integer order PID controllers and present operating Reactor Regulating System
(RRS) due to its robustness against shift in system parameters."
"Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been used in this paper for a new Nyquist based
sub-optimal model reduction and optimal time domain tuning of PID and
fractional order (FO) PI{\lambda}D{\mu} controllers. Comparative studies show
that the new model reduction technique outperforms the conventional H2-norm
based reduced order modeling techniques. Optimum tuning rule has been developed
next with a test-bench of higher order processes via Genetic Programming (GP)
with minimum value of weighted integral error index and control signal. From
the Pareto optimal front which is a trade-off between the complexity of the
formulae and control performance, an efficient set of tuning rules has been
generated for time domain optimal PID and PI{\lambda}D{\mu} controllers."
"This paper analyzes a nuclear reactor power signal that suffers from network
induced random delays in the shared data network while being fed-back to the
Reactor Regulating System (RRS). A detailed study is carried out to investigate
the self similarity of random delay dynamics due to the network traffic in
shared medium. The fractionality or selfsimilarity in the network induced delay
that corrupts the measured power signal coming from Self Powered Neutron
Detectors (SPND) is estimated and analyzed. As any fractional order randomness
is intrinsically different from conventional Gaussian kind of randomness, these
delay dynamics need to be handled efficiently, before reaching the controller
within the RRS. An attempt has been made to minimize the effect of the
randomness in the reactor power transient data with few classes of smoothing
filters. The performance measure of the smoothers with fractional order noise
consideration is also investigated into."
"The paper presents a Stateflow based network test-bed to validate real-time
optimal control algorithms. Genetic Algorithm (GA) based time domain
performance index minimization is attempted for tuning of PI controller to
handle a balanced lag and delay type First Order Plus Time Delay (FOPTD)
process over network. The tuning performance is validated on a real-time
communication network with artificially simulated stochastic delay, packet loss
and out-of order packets characterizing the network."
"Gain and order scheduling of fractional order (FO) PI{\lambda}D{\mu}
controllers are studied in this paper considering four different classes of
higher order processes. The mapping between the optimum PID/FOPID controller
parameters and the reduced order process models are done using Radial Basis
Function (RBF) type Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Simulation studies have
been done to show the effectiveness of the RBFNN for online scheduling of such
controllers with random change in set-point and process parameters."
"Rational approximation of fractional order (FO) differ-integrators via
Continued Fraction Expansion (CFE) is a well known technique. In this paper,
the nominal structures of various generating functions are optimized using
Genetic Algorithm (GA) to minimize the deviation in magnitude and phase
response between the original FO element and the rationalized discrete time
filter in Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) structure. The optimized filter based
realizations show better approximation of the FO elements in comparison with
the existing methods and is demonstrated by the frequency response of the IIR
filters."
"This paper presents a scheme to design a tracking controller for a class of
uncertain nonlinear systems using a robust feedback linearization approach. The
scheme is composed of two steps. In the first step, a linearized uncertainty
model for the corresponding uncertain nonlinear system is developed using a
robust feedback linearization approach. In this step, the standard feedback
linearization approach is used to linearize the nominal nonlinear dynamics of
the uncertain nonlinear system. The remaining nonlinear uncertainties are then
linearized at an arbitrary point using the mean value theorem. This approach
gives a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear uncertain system model with a
structured uncertainty representation. In the second step, a minimax linear
quadratic regulation (LQR) controller is designed for MIMO linearized uncertain
system model. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
it is applied to a velocity and altitude tracking control problem for an
air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicle."
"We present a subspace system identification method based on weighted nuclear
norm approximation. The weight matrices used in the nuclear norm minimization
are the same weights as used in standard subspace identification methods. We
show that the inclusion of the weights improves the performance in terms of fit
on validation data. As a second benefit, the weights reduce the size of the
optimization problems that need to be solved. Experimental results from
randomly generated examples as well as from the Daisy benchmark collection are
reported. The key to an efficient implementation is the use of the alternating
direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problem."
"In this paper, we study cooperative multi-agent systems in which the target
objective and the controls exercised by the agents are dependent on the choices
they made at initial system time. Such systems have been investigated in
several recently published papers, mainly from the perspective of system
analysis on issues such as control communication complexity, control energy
cost and the feasibility of realization of target functions. This paper
continues this line of research by developing optimal control design
methodology for linear systems that are collaboratively manipulated by multiple
agents based on their distributed choices. For target matrices that satisfy
particular structural constraints, we derive control algorithms that can
achieve the specified targets with minimum control cost. We compare
state-feedback as well as open-loop control strategies for target realization
and extend the optimality result to an arbitrary target matrix. The optimal
control solutions are obtained by minimizing the average control cost subject
to the set of specified target-state constraints by means of modern variation
theory and the Lagrange multiplier method."
"Several design parameters in collective robotic systems have been
investigated and developed in order to explore the cooperation among the
autonomous robotic individuals in a variety of robotic swarms in the presence
of different internal and external system constraints. In particular, the
dynamic power management and distribution in a multi-robotic organism is of
very high importance that depends not only on the electronic design but also on
the mechanical structure of the robots. It further defines the true nature of
the collaboration among the modules of a self-reconfigurable multi-robotic
organism. This article describes the essential features and design of a dynamic
power distribution and management system for a dynamically reconfigurable
multi-robotic system. It further presents the empirical results of the proposed
dynamic power management system collected with the real robotic platform. In
the later half of the article, it presents a simulation framework that was
especially developed to explore the collective system behavior and complexities
involved in the operations of a multi-robotic organism. At the end, summary and
conclusion follows the detailed discussion on the obtained simulation results."
"As a benchmark exercise for testing software and methods developed in Hycon2
for decentralized and distributed control, we address the problem of designing
the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) layer in power network systems. In
particular, we present three different scenarios and discuss performance levels
that can be reached using Centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC). These
results can be used as a milestone for comparing the performance of alternative
control schemes. Matlab software for simulating the scenarios is also provided
in an accompanying file."
"In this paper, we examine in an abstract framework, how a tradeoff between
efficiency and robustness arises in different dynamic oligopolistic market
architectures. We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource
provider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process.
Self-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource
consumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the
total resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's
deadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand
processes induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling
schemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads
to an efficiency loss - widely known as the ""price of anarchy"" - the stationary
distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail.
This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is
important in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents
can cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market
efficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes. We
thus posit that the origins of endogenous risk in such systems may lie in the
market architecture, which is an inherent characteristic of the system."
"The research area of Networked Control Systems (NCS) has been the topic of
intensive study in the last decade. In this paper we give a contribution to
this research line by addressing symbolic control design of (possibly unstable)
nonlinear NCS with specifications expressed in terms of automata. We first
derive symbolic models that are shown to approximate the given NCS in the sense
of (alternating) approximate simulation. We then address symbolic control
design with specifications expressed in terms of automata. We finally derive
efficient algorithms for the synthesis of the proposed symbolic controllers
that cope with the inherent computational complexity of the problem at hand."
"This paper deals with a nonlinear adaptive autopilot design for agile missile
systems. In advance of the autopilot design, an investigation of the agile turn
maneuver, based on the trajectory optimization, is performed to determine state
behaviors during the agile turn phase. This investigation shows that there
exist highly nonlinear, rapidly changing dynamics and aerodynamic
uncertainties. To handle of these difficulties, we propose a longitudinal
autopilot for angle-of-attack tracking based on backstepping control
methodology in conjunction with the time-delay adaptation scheme."
"A straight forward application of feedback linearization to the missile
autopilot design for acceleration control may be limited due to the nonminimum
characteristics and the model uncertainties. As a remedy, this paper presents a
cascade structure of an acceleration controller based on approximate feedback
linearization methodology with a time-delay adaptation scheme. The inner loop
controller is constructed by applying feedback linearization to the approximate
system which is a minimum phase system and provides the desired acceleration
signal caused by the angle-of-attack. This controller is augmented by the
time-delay adaptive law and the outer loop PI (proportional-integral)
controller in order to adaptively compensate for feedback linearization error
because of model uncertainty and in order to track the desired acceleration
signal. The performance of the proposed method is examined through numerical
simulations. Moreover, the proposed controller is tested by using an intercept
scenario in 6DOF nonlinear simulations."
"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the generalized formulation of
weighted optimal guidance laws with impact angle constraint. From the
generalized formulation, we explicitly find the feasible set of weighting
functions that lead to analytical forms of weighted optimal guidance laws. This
result has potential significance because it can provide additional degrees of
freedom in designing a guidance law that accomplishes the specified guidance
objective."
"We employ supervisory controllers to safely coordinate high-level
discrete(-event) behavior of distributed components of complex systems.
Supervisory controllers observe discrete-event system behavior, make a decision
on allowed activities, and communicate the control signals to the involved
parties. Models of the supervisory controllers can be automatically synthesized
based on formal models of the system components and a formalization of the safe
coordination (control) requirements. Based on the obtained models, code
generation can be used to implement the supervisory controllers in software, on
a PLC, or an embedded (micro)processor. In this article, we develop a process
theory with data that supports a model-based systems engineering framework for
supervisory coordination. We employ communication to distinguish between the
different flows of information, i.e., observation and supervision, whereas we
employ data to specify the coordination requirements more compactly, and to
increase the expressivity of the framework. To illustrate the framework, we
remodel an industrial case study involving coordination of maintenance
procedures of a printing process of a high-tech Oce printer."
"In this paper we present a new approach towards global passive approximation
in order to find a passive transfer function G(s) that is nearest in some
well-defined matrix norm sense to a non-passive transfer function H(s). It is
based on existing solutions to pertinent matrix nearness problems. It is shown
that the key point in constructing the nearest passive transfer function, is to
find a good rational approximation of the well-known ramp function over an
interval defined by the minimum and maximum dissipation of H(s). The proposed
algorithms rely on the stable anti-stable projection of a given transfer
function. Pertinent examples are given to show the scope and accuracy of the
proposed algorithms."
"We present a synthesis method for communication protocols for active safety
applications that satisfy certain formal specifications on quality of service
requirements. The protocols are developed to provide reliable communication
services for automobile active safety applications. The synthesis method
transforms a specification into a distributed implementation of senders and
receivers that together satisfy the quality of service requirements by
transmitting messages over an unreliable medium. We develop a specification
language and an execution model for the implementations, and demonstrate the
viability of our method by developing a protocol for a traffic scenario in
which a car runs a red light at a busy intersection."
"Our goal is to achieve a high degree of fault tolerance through the control
of a safety critical systems. This reduces to solving a game between a
malicious environment that injects failures and a controller who tries to
establish a correct behavior. We suggest a new control objective for such
systems that offers a better balance between complexity and precision: we seek
systems that are k-resilient. In order to be k-resilient, a system needs to be
able to rapidly recover from a small number, up to k, of local faults
infinitely many times, provided that blocks of up to k faults are separated by
short recovery periods in which no fault occurs. k-resilience is a simple but
powerful abstraction from the precise distribution of local faults, but much
more refined than the traditional objective to maximize the number of local
faults. We argue why we believe this to be the right level of abstraction for
safety critical systems when local faults are few and far between. We show that
the computational complexity of constructing optimal control with respect to
resilience is low and demonstrate the feasibility through an implementation and
experimental results."
"This technical report presents a direct proof of Theorem~1 in [1] and some
consequences that also account for (20) in [1]. This direct proof exploits a
state space change of basis which replaces the coupled difference equations
(10) in [1] with two equivalent difference equations which, instead, are
decoupled."
"In this paper, a new nonlinear identification framework is proposed to
address the issue of off-line computation of moving-horizon observer estimate.
The proposed structure merges the advantages of nonlinear approximators with
the efficient computation of constrained quadratic programming problems. A
bound on the estimation error is proposed and the efficiency of the resulting
scheme is illustrated using two state estimation examples."
"The structural invariant subspaces of the discrete-time singular Hamiltonian
system are used in 1] to give an analytic nonrecursive expression of all the
admissible trajectories. A deeper insight into the features of these subspaces,
particularly focused on the dimensionality issue, is the object of this note."
"This paper proposes the design of Fractional Order (FO) Butterworth filter in
complex w-plane (w=sq; q being any real number) considering the presence of
under-damped, hyper-damped, ultra-damped poles. This is the first attempt to
design such fractional Butterworth filters in complex w-plane instead of
complex s-plane, as conventionally done for integer order filters. Firstly, the
concept of fractional derivatives and w-plane stability of linear fractional
order systems are discussed. Detailed mathematical formulation for the design
of fractional Butterworth-like filter (FBWF) in w-plane is then presented.
Simulation examples are given along with a practical example to design the FO
Butterworth filter with given specifications in frequency domain to show the
practicability of the proposed formulation."
"Convenience and safeguarding our home appliances have become an important
issue when dealing with an advancement and growth of an economy. This research
focuses on the design and construction of a Dual Sensor heat-monitoring system.
The circuit works by monitoring temperature from an external input and
comparing the temperature level with that of a preset temperature value. The
power output of the circuit is cut off or switched OFF or an alarm is triggered
ON if the temperature of the external input is equal to or, greater than the
preset temperature value. The methodology involves the application of linear
precision temperature sensors i.e., they generate a voltage that is directly
proportional to the temperature. Basically the system is constructed using
temperature sensors and comparators. The system is powered using a 12V power
supply. The results of the tests showed that the power output of the circuit is
switched OFF hence switching OFF the heating device or an alarm is triggered ON
when the device exceeded a preset temperature level. The general operation of
the system and performance is dependent on the temperature difference between
the preset temperature value and external temperature intended to be monitored.
The overall system was tested and found perfectly functional."
"A predictive control scheme for a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)
is presented. It is based on a suboptimal method for computationally efficient
trajectory generation based on continuous parameterization and linear
programming. The torque controller optimizes a quadratic cost consisting of
control error and machine losses in real-time respecting voltage and current
limitations. The multivariable controller decouples the two current components
and exploits cross-coupling effects in the long-range constrained predictive
control strategy. The optimization results in fast and smooth torque dynamics
while inherently using field-weakening to improve the power efficiency and the
current dynamics in high speed operation. The performance of the scheme is
demonstrated by experimental results."
"Direct Torque Control (DTC) is well known as an effective control technique
for high performance drives in a wide variety of industrial applications and
conventional DTC technique uses two constant reference value: torque and stator
flux. In this paper, a new fuzzy based stator flux optimizer has been proposed
for DTC controlled induction motor drivers and simulation studies have been
carried out with Matlab/Simulink to compare the proposed system behaviours at
vary load conditions. The most important feature of the proposed fuzzy logic
based stator flux optimizer that it self-regulates the stator flux reference
value using the motor load situation without need of any motor parameters.
Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed DTC technique has
been improved and especially at low-load conditions torque ripples are greatly
reduced with respect to the conventional DTC."
"This paper participates in the development of a unified approach to the
control of aerial vehicles with extended flight envelopes. More precisely,
modeling for control purposes of a class of thrust-propelled aerial vehicles
subjected to lift and drag aerodynamic forces is addressed assuming a
rotational symmetry of the vehicle's shape about the thrust force axis. A
condition upon aerodynamic characteristics that allows one to recast the
control problem into the simpler case of a spherical vehicle is pointed out.
Beside showing how to adapt nonlinear controllers developed for this latter
case, the paper extends a previous work by the authors in two directions.
First, the 3D case is addressed whereas only motions in a single vertical plane
was considered. Secondly, the family of models of aerodynamic forces for which
the aforementioned transformation holds is enlarged."
"Digital equipment such as computers, telecommunication systems and
instruments use microprocessors that operate at high frequencies allowing them
to carry out millions or even billions of operations per second. A disturbance
in the electrical supply lasting just a few milliseconds can affect thousands
or millions of basic operations. The result may be malfunctioning and loss of
data with dangerous or costly consequences (e.g. loss of production). That is
why many loads, called sensitive or critical loads, require a supply that is
protected. Many manufacturers of sensitive equipment specify very strict
tolerances, much stricter than those in the distribution system for the supply
of their equipment, one example being Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association for computer equipment against distribution system disturbances.
The design of this uninterrupted power supply (UPS) for personal computer (PC)
is necessitated due to a need for enhanced portability in the design of
personal computer desktop workstations. Apart from its original functionality
as a backup source of power, this design incorporates the unit within the
system unit casing, thereby reducing the number of system components available.
Also, the embedding of this unit removes the untidiness of connecting wires and
makes the whole computer act like a laptop. Not to be left out is the choice of
a microcontroller as an important part of the circuitry. This has eliminated
the weight and space-consuming components that make up an original design. The
singular use of this microcontroller places the UPS under the class of an
advanced technology device."
"The Anti Collision device is a detection device meant to be incorporated into
cars for the purpose of safety. As opposed to the anti collision devices
present in the market today, this system is not designed to control the
vehicle. Instead, it serves as an alert in the face of imminent collision. The
device is intended to find a way to implement a minimum spacing for cars in
traffic in an affordable way. It would also achieve safety for the passengers
of a moving car. The device is made up of an infrared transmitter and receiver.
Also incorporated into it is an audio visual alarm to work in with the receiver
and effectively alert the driver and/or the passengers. To achieve this design,
555 timers coupled both as astable and monostable circuits were used along with
a 38 KHz Square Pulse generator. The device works by sending out streams of
infrared radiation and when these rays are seen by the other equipped vehicle,
both are meant to take the necessary precaution to avert a collision. The
device would still sound an alarm even though it is not receiving infrared
beams from the oncoming vehicle. This is due to reflection of its own infrared
beams. At the end of the design and testing process, overall system was
implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly functional."
"It has been shown that max-plus linear systems are well suited for
applications in synchronization and scheduling, such as the generation of train
timetables, manufacturing, or traffic. In this paper we show that the same is
true for multi-legged locomotion. In this framework, the max-plus eigenvalue of
the system matrix represents the total cycle time, whereas the max-plus
eigenvector dictates the steady-state behavior. Uniqueness of the
eigenstructure also indicates uniqueness of the resulting behavior. For the
particular case of legged locomotion, the movement of each leg is abstracted to
two-state circuits: swing and stance (leg in flight and on the ground,
respectively). The generation of a gait (a manner of walking) for a multiple
legged robot is then achieved by synchronizing the multiple discrete-event
cycles via the max-plus framework. By construction, different gaits and gait
parameters can be safely interleaved by using different system matrices. In
this paper we address both the transient and steady-state behavior for a class
of gaits by presenting closed-form expressions for the max-plus eigenvalue and
max-plus eigenvector of the system matrix and the coupling time. The
significance of this result is in showing guaranteed robustness to
perturbations and gait switching, and also a systematic methodology for
synthesizing controllers that allow for legged robots to change rhythms fast."
"We present a novel method called Kernel-SME filter for tracking multiple
targets when the association of the measurements to the targets is unknown. The
method is a further development of the Symmetric Measurement Equation (SME)
filter, which removes the data association uncertainty of the original
measurement equation with the help of a symmetric transformation. The
underlying idea of the Kernel-SME filter is to construct a symmetric
transformation by means of mapping the measurements to a Gaussian mixture. This
transformation is scalable to a large number of targets and allows for deriving
a Gaussian state estimator that has a cubic time complexity in the number of
targets."
"The PID controller parameters can be adjusted in such a manner that it gives
the desired frequency response and the results are found using the Bodes
integral formula in order to adjust the slope of the nyquist curve in a desired
manner. The same idea is applied for plants with time delay . The same has also
been done in a new approach . The delay term is approximated as a transfer
function using Pade approximation and then the Bode integral is used to
determine the controller parameters. Both the methodologies are demonstrated
with MATLAB simulation of representative plants and accompanying PID
controllers. A proper comparison of the two methodologies is also done. The PID
controller parameters are also tuned using a real coded Genetic Algorithm (GA)
and a proper comparison is done between the three methods."
"Microgrid (MG) is a promising component for future smart grid (SG)
deployment. The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the
most important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel
framework for smart energy management based on the concept of
quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident
electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic
usage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled
based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the
MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e.,
QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy
resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as
a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization
technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling
algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual
queues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require
any statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price
processes. We derive several ""hard"" performance bounds for the proposed
algorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The
simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity
scheduling algorithm."
"We analyze a distributed algorithm for estimation of scalar parameters
belonging to nodes in a mobile network from noisy relative measurements. The
motivation comes from the problem of clock skew and offset estimation for the
purpose of time synchronization. The time variation of the network was modeled
as a Markov chain. The estimates are shown to be mean square convergent under
fairly weak assumptions on the Markov chain, as long as the union of the graphs
is connected. Expressions for the asymptotic mean and correlation are also
provided. The Markovian switching topology model of mobile networks is
justified for certain node mobility models through empirically estimated
conditional entropy measures."
"We propose a new modeling paradigm for large dimensional aggregates of
stochastic systems by Generalized Factor Analysis (GFA) models. These models
describe the data as the sum of a flocking plus an uncorrelated idiosyncratic
component. The flocking component describes a sort of collective orderly motion
which admits a much simpler mathematical description than the whole ensemble
while the idiosyncratic component describes weakly correlated noise. We first
discuss static GFA representations and characterize in a rigorous way the
properties of the two components. The extraction of the dynamic flocking
component is discussed for time-stationary linear systems and for a simple
classes of separable random fields."
"The guidance of a torpedo represents a hard task because of the smooth
nonlinear aspect of this system and because of the extreme external
disturbances. The torpedo guidance reposes on the speed and the position
control. In fact, the control approach which is very solicited for the
electromechanical systems is the sliding mode control (SMC) which proved its
effectiveness through the different studies. The SMC is robust versus
disturbances and model uncertainties; however, a sharp discontinuous control is
needed which induces the chattering phenomenon. The angular velocity
measurement is a hard task because of the high level of disturbances. In this
way, the sliding mode observer could be a solution for the velocity estimation
instead of a sensor. This article deals with torpedo guidance by SMC to reach
the desired path in a short time and with high precision quality. Simulation
results show that this control strategy and observer can attain excellent
control performances with no chattering problem."
"This work deals with the design of a sliding mode observer with a
multi-surfaces sliding mode multimodel control (SM-MMC) for a mechanical
sensorless pumping system. The observer is designed to estimate the speed and
the mechanical position of the DC motor operating in the process. Robustness
tests validated by simulation show the effectiveness of the sliding mode
observer associated with this control approach (SM-MMC)."
"This paper proposes a robust control of doublefed induction generator of wind
turbine to optimize its production: that means the energy quality and
efficiency. The proposed control reposes in the sliding mode control using a
multimodel approach which contributes on the minimization of the static error
and the chattering phenomenon. This new approach is called sliding mode
multimodel control (SMMC). Simulation results show good performances of this
control."
"Electricity peaks can be harmful to grid stability and result in additional
generation costs to balance supply with demand. By developing a network of
smart appliances together with a quasi-decentralized control protocol, direct
load control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by
directly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper
proposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application
to air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a
fixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their
preferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will
determine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model
to investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are
proposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the
PDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves
that the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point
with fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second
theorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of
all the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes
an allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in
theorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the
theorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no
control is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results."
"Demand side management has gained increasing importance as the penetration of
renewable energy grows. Based on a Markov jump process modelling of a group of
thermostatic loads, this paper proposes a two level feedback system design
between the independent system operator (ISO) and the regulation service
provider such that two objectives are achieved: (1) the ISO can optimally
dispatch regulation signals to multiple providers in real time in order to
reduce the requirement for expensive spinning reserves, and (2) each regulation
provider can control its thermostatic loads to respond the ISO signal. It is
also shown that the amount of regulation service that can be provided is
implicitly restricted by a few fundamental parameters of the provider itself,
such as the allowable set point choice and its thermal constant. An interesting
finding is that the regulation provider's ability to provide a large amount of
long term accumulated regulation and short term signal tracking restrict each
other. Simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the
performance of the proposed framework."
"This paper addresses a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem for
downlink OFDMA aided by a decode-and-forward (DF) relay under a total power
constraint. A novel subcarrier-pair based opportunistic DF relaying protocol is
proposed. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two time slots. A
subcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot
for the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and
the relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the
subcarrier in the second slot. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or
second slot is used for the source's direct transmission to a user. A benchmark
protocol, same as the proposed one except that the transmit beamforming is not
used for the relay-aided transmission, is also considered. For each protocol, a
polynomial-complexity algorithm is developed to find at least an approximately
optimum resource allocation (RA), by using continuous relaxation, the dual
method, and Hungarian algorithm. Instrumental to the algorithm design is an
elegant definition of optimization variables, motivated by the idea of
regarding the unpaired subcarriers as virtual subcarrier pairs in the direct
transmission mode. The effectiveness of the RA algorithm and the impact of
relay position and total power on the protocols' performance are illustrated by
numerical experiments. The proposed protocol always leads to a maximum WSR
equal to or greater than that for the benchmark one, and the performance gain
of using the proposed one is significant especially when the relay is in close
proximity to the source and the total power is low. Theoretical analysis is
presented to interpret these observations."
"In this paper we consider a linear system structured into physically coupled
subsystems and propose a decentralized control scheme capable to guarantee
asymptotic stability and satisfaction of constraints on system inputs and
states. The design procedure is totally decentralized, since the synthesis of a
local controller uses only information on a subsystem and its neighbors, i.e.
subsystems coupled to it. We first derive tests for checking if a subsystem can
be plugged into (or unplugged from) an existing plant without spoiling overall
stability and constraint satisfaction. When this is possible, we show how to
automatize the design of local controllers so that it can be carried out in
parallel by smart actuators equipped with computational resources and capable
to exchange information with neighboring subsystems. In particular, local
controllers exploit tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in order to
guarantee robustness with respect to physical coupling among subsystems.
Finally, an application of the proposed control design procedure to frequency
control in power networks is presented."
"In this paper, we present an automated technique SWATI: Synthesizing
Wordlengths Automatically Using Testing and Induction, which uses a combination
of Nelder-Mead optimization based testing, and induction from examples to
automatically synthesize optimal fixedpoint implementation of numerical
routines. The design of numerical software is commonly done using
floating-point arithmetic in design-environments such as Matlab. However, these
designs are often implemented using fixed-point arithmetic for speed and
efficiency reasons especially in embedded systems. The fixed-point
implementation reduces implementation cost, provides better performance, and
reduces power consumption. The conversion from floating-point designs to
fixed-point code is subject to two opposing constraints: (i) the word-width of
fixed-point types must be minimized, and (ii) the outputs of the fixed-point
program must be accurate. In this paper, we propose a new solution to this
problem. Our technique takes the floating-point program, specified accuracy and
an implementation cost model and provides the fixed-point program with
specified accuracy and optimal implementation cost. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on a set of examples from the domain of automated
control, robotics and digital signal processing."
"This paper investigates cooperative environmental monitoring for
Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) visual sensor networks. We first present a novel
formulation of the optimal environmental monitoring problem, whose objective
function is intertwined with the uncertain state of the environment. In
addition, due to the large volume of vision data, it is desired for each sensor
to execute processing through local computation and communication. To address
the issues, we present a distributed solution to the problem based on game
theoretic cooperative control and payoff-based learning. At the first stage, a
utility function is designed so that the resulting game constitutes a potential
game with potential function equal to the group objective function, where the
designed utility is shown to be computable through local image processing and
communication. Then, we present a payoff-based learning algorithm so that the
sensors are led to the global objective function maximizers without using any
prior information on the environmental state. Finally, we run experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach."
"In the scope of discrete finite-state models of interacting components, we
present a novel algorithm for identifying sets of local states of components
whose activity is necessary for the reachability of a given local state. If all
the local states from such a set are disabled in the model, the concerned
reachability is impossible. Those sets are referred to as cut sets and are
computed from a particular abstract causality structure, so-called Graph of
Local Causality, inspired from previous work and generalised here to finite
automata networks. The extracted sets of local states form an
under-approximation of the complete minimal cut sets of the dynamics: there may
exist smaller or additional cut sets for the given reachability. Applied to
qualitative models of biological systems, such cut sets provide potential
therapeutic targets that are proven to prevent molecules of interest to become
active, up to the correctness of the model. Our new method makes tractable the
formal analysis of very large scale networks, as illustrated by the computation
of cut sets within a Boolean model of biological pathways interactions
gathering more than 9000 components."
"Since the complexity of the practical environment, many distributed networked
systems can not be illustrated with the integer-order dynamics and only be
described as the fractional-order dynamics. Suppose multi-agent systems will
show the individual diversity with difference agents, where the heterogeneous
(integer-order and fractional-order) dynamics are used to illustrate the agent
systems and compose integer-fractional compounded-order systems. Applying
Laplace transform and frequency domain theory of the fractional-order operator,
consensus of delayed multi-agent systems with directed weighted topologies is
studied. Since integer-order model is the special case of fractional-order
model, the results in this paper can be extend to the systems with
integer-order models. Finally, numerical examples are used to verify our
results."
"A general decentralized computational framework for set-valued state
estimation and prediction for the class of systems that accept a hybrid state
machine representation is considered in this article. The decentralized scheme
consists of a conjunction of distributed state machines that are specified by a
decomposition of the external signal space. While this is shown to produce, in
general, outer approximations of the outcomes of the original monolithic state
machine, here, specific rules for the signal space decomposition are devised by
utilizing structural properties of the underyling transition relation, leading
to a recovery of the exact state set results. By applying a suitable
approximation algorithm, we show that computational complexity in the
decentralized setting may thereby essentially reduce as compared to the
centralized estimation scheme."
"A symbolic approach to decentralized set-valued state estimation and
prediction for systems that admit a hybrid state machine representations is
proposed. The decentralized computational scheme represents a conj unction of a
finite number of distributed state machines, which are specified by an
appropriate decomposition of the external signal space. It aims at a
distribution of computational tasks into smaller ones, allocated to individual
distributed state machines, leading to a potentially significant reduction in
the overall space/time computational complexity. We show that, in general, such
a scheme outerapproximates the state set estimates and predictions of the
original monolithic state machine. By utilizing structural properties of the
transition relation of the latter, in a next step, we propose constructive
decomposition algorithms for a recovery of the exact state set outcomes."
"Swarm robotic systems are mainly inspired by swarms of socials insects and
the collective emergent behavior that arises from their cooperation at the
lower lever. Despite the limited sensory ability, computational power, and
communication means of each swarm member, the swarm as a group manages to
achieve difficult tasks such as searching for food in terrains with obstacles
that individual robots cannot achieve in isolation of the other group members.
Moreover, such tasks are usually achieved without having information sharing
capabilities at the swarm level or having a centralized decision making system.
In this report, I survey the state of the field of applying adaptive control
method to increase swarm robotic systems robustness to the failure of
individual robots, and increase its efficiency in performing its task. A few
techniques for the division of labor problem are briefly presented while one of
them is given in more detail. A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages
of this system is given and suggestions of potential improvements that can be
made to the system are presented."
"We consider the use of {\Delta}{\Sigma} modulators in ac motor drives,
focusing on the many additional degrees of freedom that this option offers over
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Following some recent results, we show that it is
possible to fully adapt the {\Delta}{\Sigma} modulator Noise Transfer Function
(NTF) to the rest of the drive chain and that the approach can be pushed even
to a fine adaptation of the NTF to the specific motor loading condition. We
investigate whether and to what extent the adaptation should be pursued. Using
a representative test case and extensive simulation, we conclude that a mild
adaptation can be beneficial, leading to Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
improvements in the order a few dB, while the advantage pushing the adaptation
to the load tracking is likely to be minimal."
"The problem of finding the set of all multi-model robust PID and three-term
stabilizers for discrete-time systems is solved in this paper. The method uses
the fact that decoupling of parameter space at singular frequencies is
invariant under a linear transformation. The resulting stable regions are
composed by convex polygonal slices. The design problem includes the assertion
of intervals with stable polygons and the detection of stable polygons. This
paper completes the solutions to both problems."
"A comprehensive theory for robust PID control in continuous-time and
discrete-time domain is reviewed in this paper. For a given finite set of
linear time invariant plants, algorithms for fast computation of robustly
stabilizing regions in the ($k_P, k_I, k_D$)-parameter space are introduced.
The main impetus is given by the fact that non-convex stable regions in the PID
parameter space can be built up by convex polygonal slices. A simple and an
elegant theory evolved in the last few years up to a quite mature level."
"In this paper, we study the continuous-time consensus problem in the presence
of adversaries. The networked multi-agent system is modeled as a switched
system, where the normal agents have integrator dynamics and the switching
signal determines the topology of the network. We consider several models of
omniscient adversaries under the assumption that at most a fraction of any
normal agent's neighbors may be adversaries. Under this fractional assumption
on the interaction between normal and adversary agents, we show that a novel
graph theoretic metric, called fractional robustness, is useful for analyzing
the network topologies under which the normal agents achieve consensus."
"This paper considers the leader-follower control problem for a linear
multi-agent system with undirected topology and linear coupling subject to
integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A consensus-type control protocol is
proposed based on each agent's states relative its neighbors. In addition a
selected set of agents uses for control their states relative the leader. Using
a coordinate transformation, the consensus analysis of the multi-agent system
is recast as a decentralized robust control problem for an auxiliary
interconnected large scale system. Based on this interconnected large scale
system, sufficient conditions are obtained which guarantee that the system
tracks the leader. These conditions guarantee a suboptimal bound on the system
tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
using a simulation example."
"The movements of birds, bats, and other flying species are governed by
complex sensorimotor systems that allow the animals to react to stationary
environmental features as well as to wind disturbances, other animals in nearby
airspace, and a wide variety of unexpected challenges. The paper and talk will
describe research that analyzes the three-dimensional trajectories of bats
flying in a habitat in Texas. The trajectories are computed with stereoscopic
methods using data from synchronous thermal videos that were recorded with high
temporal and spatial resolution from three viewpoints. Following our previously
reported work, we examine the possibility that bat trajectories in this habitat
are governed by optical flow sensing that interpolates periodic distance
measurements from echolocation. Using an idealized geometry of bat eyes, we
introduce the concept of time-to-transit, and recall some research that
suggests that this quantity is computed by the animals' visual cortex. Several
steering control laws based on time-to-transit are proposed for an idealized
flight model, and it is shown that these can be used to replicate the observed
flight of what we identify as typical bats. Although the vision-based motion
control laws we propose and the protocols for switching between them are quite
simple, some of the trajectories that have been synthesized are qualitatively
bat-like. Examination of the control protocols that generate these trajectories
suggests that bat motions are governed both by their reactions to a subset of
key feature points as well by their memories of where these feature points are
located."
"This paper considers optimal input design when the intended use of the
identified model is to construct a feed-forward controller based on measurable
disturbances. The objective is to find a minimum power excitation signal to be
used in system identification experiment, such that the corresponding
model-based feed-forward controller guarantees, with a given probability, that
the variance of the output signal is within given specifications. To start
with, some low order model problems are analytically solved and fundamental
properties of the optimal input signal solution are presented. The optimal
input signal contains feed-forward control and depends of the noise model and
transfer function of the system in a specific way. Next, we show how to apply
the partial correlation approach to closed loop optimal experiment design to
the general feed-forward problem. A framework for optimal input signal design
for feed-forward control is presented and numerically evaluated on a
temperature control problem."
"Non-linear controller is preferred to linear controller due to non-linear
operation of DSTATCOM. System dynamic can be improved by regulating and fixing
the capacitor DC voltage in DSTATCOM. The nonlinear control is based on exact
linearization via feedback. There is a PI controller in this system to regulate
DC voltage. In conventional scheme, the trial and error method is used to
determine PI values. Exact calculation to optimize PI coefficients can be
carried out to reduce disturbances in DC link voltage and thus, in this paper,
Particle Swarm Optimization is applied. As a result, Capacitor voltage tracks
the reference values which have less vibration than conventional status. Both
trial and error method and PSO are implemented. A set of corresponding diagrams
achieved by these two methods are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of
new method. Optimizations and Simulations are worked out in MATLAB environment."
"In this paper, a novel adaptive-gain Second Order Sliding Mode (SOSM)
observer is proposed for multicell converters by considering it as a class of
hybrid systems. The aim is to reduce the number of voltage sensors by
estimating the capacitor voltages only from the measurement of load current.
The proposed observer is proven to be robust in the presence of perturbations
with \emph{unknown} boundary. However, the states of the system are only
partially observable in the sense of observability rank condition. Due to its
switching behavior, a recent concept of $Z(T_N)$ observability is used to
analysis its hybrid observability, since its observability depends upon the
switching control signals. Under certain condition of the switching sequences,
the voltage across each capacitor becomes observable. Simulation results and
comparisons with Luenberger switched observer highlight the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed observer with respect to output measurement noise
and system uncertainties (load variations)."
"The paper discusses fundamental detectability properties associated with the
problem of distributed state estimation using networked observers. The main
result of the paper establishes connections between detectability of the plant
through measurements, observability of the node filters through
interconnections, and algebraic properties of the underlying communication
graph, to ensure the interconnected filtering error dynamics are stabilizable
via output injection."
"Blind system identification is known to be a hard ill-posed problem and
without further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this
contribution, we are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from
only output measurements. Driven by the task of identifying systems that are
turned on and off at unknown times, we seek a piecewise constant input and a
corresponding ARX model which approximates the measured outputs. We phrase this
as a rank minimization problem and present a relaxed convex formulation to
approximate its solution. The proposed method was developed to model power
consumption of electrical appliances and is now a part of a bigger energy
disaggregation framework. Code will be made available online."
"This paper studies a generalization of the standard continuous-time consensus
protocol, obtained by replacing the Laplacian matrix of the communication graph
with the so-called deformed Laplacian. The deformed Laplacian is a
second-degree matrix polynomial in the real variable 's' which reduces to the
standard Laplacian for 's' equal to unity. The stability properties of the
ensuing deformed consensus protocol are studied in terms of parameter 's' for
some special families of undirected and directed graphs, and for arbitrary
graph topologies by leveraging the spectral theory of quadratic eigenvalue
problems. Examples and simulation results are provided to illustrate our
theoretical findings."
"We present the sensor setup and the basic navigation algorithm used for the
flight control of the SkySails towing kite system. Starting with brief
summaries on system setup and equations of motion of the tethered kite system,
we subsequently give an overview of the sensor setup, present the navigation
task and discuss challenges which have to be mastered. In the second part we
introduce in detail the inertial navigation algorithm which has been used for
operational flights for years. The functional capability of this algorithm is
illustrated by experimental flight data. Finally we suggest a modification of
the algorithms as further development step in order to overcome certain
limitations."
"Major challenges for the transition of power systems do not only tackle power
electronics but also communication technology, power market economy and user
acceptance studies. Simulation is an important research method therein, as it
helps to avoid costly failures. A common smart grid simulation platform is
still missing. We introduce a conceptual model of agents in multiple flow
networks. Flow networks extend the depth of established power flow analysis
through use of networks of information flow and financial transactions. We use
this model as a basis for comparing different power system simulators.
Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of simulators is done to facilitate the
decision for a suitable tool in comprehensive smart grid simulation."
"This paper considers a combination of intelligent repositioning decisions and
dynamic pricing for the improved operation of shared mobility systems. The
approach is applied to London's Barclays Cycle Hire scheme, which the authors
have simulated based on historical data. Using model-based predictive control
principles, dynamically varying rewards are computed and offered to customers
carrying out journeys. The aim is to encourage them to park bicycles at nearby
under-used stations, thereby reducing the expected cost of repositioning them
using dedicated staff. In parallel, the routes that repositioning staff should
take are periodically recomputed using a model-based heuristic. It is shown
that a trade-off between reward payouts to customers and the cost of hiring
repositioning staff could be made, in order to minimize operating costs for a
given desired service level."
"Consensus problem of high-order integral multi-agent systems under switching
directed topology is considered in this study. Depending on whether the agent's
full state is available or not, two distributed protocols are proposed to
ensure that states of all agents can be convergent to a same stationary value.
In the proposed protocols, the gain vector associated with the agent's
(estimated) state and the gain vector associated with the relative (estimated)
states between agents are designed in a sophisticated way. By this particular
design, the high-order integral multi-agent system can be transformed into a
first-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed
first-order integral agent's state indicates the convergence of the original
high-order integral agent's state if and only if all roots of the polynomial,
whose coefficients are the entries of the gain vector associated with the
relative (estimated) states between agents, are in the open left-half complex
plane. Therefore, many analysis techniques in the first-order integral
multi-agent system can be directly borrowed to solve the problems in the
high-order integral multi-agent system. Due to this property, it is proved that
to reach a consensus, the switching directed topology of multi-agent system is
only required to be ""uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected"", which seems
the mildest connectivity condition in the literature. In addition, the
consensus problem of discrete-time high-order integral multi-agent systems is
studied. The corresponding consensus protocol and performance analysis are
presented. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach."
"In this paper, we study the problem of formation keeping of a network of
strictly passive systems when very coarse information is exchanged. We assume
that neighboring agents only know whether their relative position is larger or
smaller than the prescribed one. This assumption results in very simple control
laws that direct the agents closer or away from each other and take values in
finite sets. We show that the task of formation keeping while tracking a
desired trajectory and rejecting matched disturbances is still achievable under
the very coarse information scenario. In contrast with other results of
practical convergence with coarse or quantized information, here the control
task is achieved exactly."
"The Random Hypersurface Model (RHM) is introduced that allows for estimating
a shape approximation of an extended object in addition to its kinematic state.
An RHM represents the spatial extent by means of randomly scaled versions of
the shape boundary. In doing so, the shape parameters and the measurements are
related via a measurement equation that serves as the basis for a Gaussian
state estimator. Specific estimators are derived for elliptic and star-convex
shapes."
"The standard engineering approach to modelling of complex systems is highly
compositional. In order to be able to understand (or to control) the behavior
of a complex dynamical systems, it is often desirable, if not necessary, to
view this system as an interconnection of smaller interacting subsystems, each
of these subsystems having its own functionalities. In this paper, we propose a
compositional approach to the computation of bisimulation functions for
dynamical systems. Bisimulation functions are quantitative generalizations of
the classical bisimulation relations. They have been shown useful for
simulation-based verification or for the computation of approximate symbolic
abstractions of dynamical systems. In this technical note, we present a
constructive result for the composition of bisimulation functions. For a
complex dynamical system consisting of several interconnected subsystems, it
allows us to compute a bisimulation function from the knowledge of a
bisimulation function for each of the subsystem."
"This paper presents the current possible applications of Dynamical Systems in
Engineering. The applications of chaos, fractals have proven to be an exciting
and fruitful endeavor. These applications are highly diverse ranging over such
fields as Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering. Dynamical Systems
theory describes general patterns found in the solution of systems of nonlinear
equations. The theory focuses upon those equations representing the change of
processes in time. This paper offers the issue of applying dynamical systems
methods to a wider circle of Engineering problems. There are three components
to our approach: ongoing and possible applications of Fractals, Chaos Theory
and Dynamical Systems. Some basic and useful computer simulation of Dynamical
System related problems have been shown also."
"Runway incursions are among the most serious safety concerns in air traffic
control. Traditional A-SMGCS level 2 safety systems detect runway incursions
with the help of surveillance information only. In the context of SESAR,
complementary safety systems are emerging that also use other information in
addition to surveillance, and that aim at warning about potential runway
incursions at earlier points in time. One such system is ""conflicting ATC
clearances"", which processes the clearances entered by the air traffic
controller into an electronic flight strips system and cross-checks them for
potentially dangerous inconsistencies. The cross-checking logic may be
implemented directly based on the clearances and on surveillance data, but this
is cumbersome. We present an approach that instead uses ground routes as an
intermediate layer, thereby simplifying the core safety logic."
"In this paper, we introduce a scalable model for the aggregate electricity
demand of a fleet of electric vehicles, which can provide the right balance
between model simplicity and accuracy. The model is based on classification of
tasks with similar energy consumption characteristics into a finite number of
clusters. The aggregator responsible for scheduling the charge of the vehicles
has two goals: 1) to provide a hard QoS guarantee to the vehicles at the lowest
possible cost; 2) to offer load or generation following services to the
wholesale market. In order to achieve these goals, we combine the scalable
demand model we propose with two scheduling mechanisms, a near-optimal and a
heuristic technique. The performance of the two mechanisms is compared under a
realistic setting in our numerical experiments."
"In this thesis, the synthesis of correct-by-construction controllers for
robots assisting in Search and Rescue (SAR) is considered. In recent years, the
development of robots assisting in disaster mitigation in urban environments
has been actively encouraged, since robots can be deployed in dangerous and
hazardous areas where human SAR operations would not be possible.
  In order to meet the reliability requirements in SAR, the specifications of
the robots are stated in Linear Temporal Logic and synthesized into finite
state machines that can be executed as controllers. The resulting controllers
are purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment
by changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from
sensors or other robots.
  Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks,
the synthesis of controllers that together achieve a common goal is considered.
This distributed synthesis problem is provably undecidable, hence it cannot be
solved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced in
order to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular,
communication and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified
standardized communication protocol and preempting negotiations between robots.
  The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search for stationary and
moving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and
robbers, and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so
that the number of robots required is minimized.
  The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for
robots performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for
moving targets. It is shown that the controllers are guaranteed to achieve the
common goal of finding and rescuing the targets."
"This paper deals with the error analysis of a novel navigation algorithm that
uses as input the sequence of images acquired from a moving camera and a
Digital Terrain (or Elevation) Map (DTM/DEM). More specifically, it has been
shown that the optical flow derived from two consecutive camera frames can be
used in combination with a DTM to estimate the position, orientation and
ego-motion parameters of the moving camera. As opposed to previous works, the
proposed approach does not require an intermediate explicit reconstruction of
the 3D world. In the present work the sensitivity of the algorithm outlined
above is studied. The main sources for errors are identified to be the
optical-flow evaluation and computation, the quality of the information about
the terrain, the structure of the observed terrain and the trajectory of the
camera. By assuming appropriate characterization of these error sources, a
closed form expression for the uncertainty of the pose and motion of the camera
is first developed and then the influence of these factors is confirmed using
extensive numerical simulations. The main conclusion of this paper is to
establish that the proposed navigation algorithm generates accurate estimates
for reasonable scenarios and error sources, and thus can be effectively used as
part of a navigation system of autonomous vehicles."
"This paper proposed an transient-based optimal parametric tuning method for
power system stabilizer (PSS) based on trajectory sensitivity (TS) analysis of
hybrid system, such as hybrid power system (HPS). The main objective is to
explore a systematic optimization approach of PSS under large disturbance of
HPS, where its nonlinear features cannot be ignored, which, however, the
traditional eigenvalue-based small signal optimizations do neglect the higher
order terms of Taylor series of the system state equations. In contrast to
previous work, the proposed TS optimal method focuses on the gradient
information of objective function with respect to decision variables by means
of the trajectory sensitivity of HPS to the PSS parameters, and optimizes the
PSS parameters in terms of the conjugate gradient method. Firstly, the
traditional parametric tuning methods of PSS are introduced. Then, the
systematic mathematical models and transient trajectory simulation are
presented by introducing switching/reset events in terms of triggering
hypersurfaces so as to formulate the optimization problem using TS analysis.
Finally, a case study of IEEE three-machine-nine-bus standard test system is
discussed in detail to exemplify the practicality and effectiveness of the
proposed optimal method."
"We study supervisor localization for real-time discrete-event systems (DES)
in the Brandin-Wonham framework of timed supervisory control. We view a
real-time DES as comprised of asynchronous agents which are coupled through
imposed logical and temporal specifications; the essence of supervisor
localization is the decomposition of monolithic (global) control action into
local control strategies for these individual agents. This study extends our
previous work on supervisor localization for untimed DES, in that monolithic
timed control action typically includes not only disabling action as in the
untimed case, but also ``clock preempting'' action which enforces prescribed
temporal behavior. The latter action is executed by a class of special events,
called ``forcible'' events; accordingly, we localize monolithic preemptive
action with respect to these events. We demonstrate the new features of timed
supervisor localization with a manufacturing cell case study, and discuss a
distributed control implementation."
"The PageRank algorithm employed by Google quantifies the importance of each
page by the link structure of the web. To reduce the computational burden the
distributed randomized PageRank algorithms (DRPA) recently appeared in
literature suggest pages to update their ranking values by locally
communicating with the linked pages. The main objective of the note is to show
that the estimates generated by DRPA converge to the true PageRank value almost
surely under the assumption that the randomization is realized in an
independent and identically distributed (iid) way. This is achieved with the
help of the stochastic approximation (SA) and its convergence results."
"We present a new output feedback fault tolerant control strategy for
continuous-time linear systems. The strategy combines a digital nominal
controller under controller-driven (varying) sampling with virtual-actuator
(VA)-based controller reconfiguration to compensate for actuator faults. In the
proposed scheme, the controller controls both the plant and the sampling
period, and performs controller reconfiguration by engaging in the loop the VA
adapted to the diagnosed fault. The VA also operates under controller-driven
sampling. Two independent objectives are considered: (a) closed-loop stability
with setpoint tracking and (b) controller reconfiguration under faults. Our
main contribution is to extend an existing VA-based controller reconfiguration
strategy to systems under controller-driven sampling in such a way that if
objective (a) is possible under controller-driven sampling (without VA) and
objective (b) is possible under uniform sampling (without controller-driven
sampling), then closed-loop stability and setpoint tracking will be preserved
under both healthy and faulty operation for all possible sampling rate
evolutions that may be selected by the controller."
"One of the most important goals of the 21st century is to change radically
the way our society produces and distributes energy. This broad objective
embodies in the smart grid's futuristic vision of a completely decentralized
system powered by renewable plants. Imagine indeed such a real time power
network in which everyone could be a consumer or a producer. Based on a coupled
information system, each user would be able to buy or sell energy at a time
depending price that would allow a homogenization of the consumption,
eradicating the well known morning or evening peak. This attractive idea is
currently booming in the scientific community as it generates intellectual
challenges in various domains.
  Nevertheless, lots of unanswered questions remain. The first steps are
currently accomplished with the appearance of smart meters or the development
of more efficient energy storage devices. However, the design of the
decentralized information system of the smart grid, which will have to deal
with huge amounts of sensor's data in order to control the system within its
stability region, seems to be still in search.
  In the following survey, we concentrate on the telecommunication part of the
smart grid system. We begin by identifying different control level in the
system, and we focus on high control levels, which are commonly attributed to
the information system. We then define a few concepts of the smart grid and
present some interesting approaches using models from the complex system
theory. In the last part, we review ongoing works aiming at establishing
telecommunication requirements for smart grid applications, and underline the
necessity of building accountable models for testing these values."
"We study the complexity of central controller synthesis problems for
finite-state Markov decision processes, where the objective is to optimize both
the expected mean-payoff performance of the system and its stability.
  We argue that the basic theoretical notion of expressing the stability in
terms of the variance of the mean-payoff (called global variance in our paper)
is not always sufficient, since it ignores possible instabilities on respective
runs. For this reason we propose alernative definitions of stability, which we
call local and hybrid variance, and which express how rewards on each run
deviate from the run's own mean-payoff and from the expected mean-payoff,
respectively.
  We show that a strategy ensuring both the expected mean-payoff and the
variance below given bounds requires randomization and memory, under all the
above semantics of variance. We then look at the problem of determining whether
there is a such a strategy. For the global variance, we show that the problem
is in PSPACE, and that the answer can be approximated in pseudo-polynomial
time. For the hybrid variance, the analogous decision problem is in NP, and a
polynomial-time approximating algorithm also exists. For local variance, we
show that the decision problem is in NP. Since the overall performance can be
traded for stability (and vice versa), we also present algorithms for
approximating the associated Pareto curve in all the three cases.
  Finally, we study a special case of the decision problems, where we require a
given expected mean-payoff together with zero variance. Here we show that the
problems can be all solved in polynomial time."
"It is known that demand and supply power balancing is an essential method to
operate power delivery system and prevent blackouts caused by power shortage.
In this paper, we focus on the implementation of demand response strategy to
save power during peak hours by using Smart Grid. It is obviously impractical
with centralized power control network to realize the real-time control
performance, where a single central controller measures the huge metering data
and sends control command back to all customers. For that purpose, we propose a
new architecture of hierarchical distributed power control network which is
scalable regardless of the network size. The sub-controllers are introduced to
partition the large system into smaller distributed clusters where low-latency
local feedback power control loops are conducted to guarantee control
stability. Furthermore, sub-controllers are stacked up in an hierarchical
manner such that data are fed back layer-by-layer in the inbound while in the
outbound control responses are decentralized in each local sub-controller for
realizing the global objectives. Numerical simulations in a realistic scenario
of up to 5000 consumers show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to
achieve a desired 10% peak power saving by using off-the-shelf wireless devices
with IEEE802.15.4g standard. In addition, a small scale power control system
for green building test-bed is implemented to demonstrate the potential use of
the proposed scheme for power saving in real life."
"We propose Markov two-components processes (M2CP) as a probabilistic model of
asynchronous systems based on the trace semantics for concurrency. Considering
an asynchronous system distributed over two sites, we introduce concepts and
tools to manipulate random trajectories in an asynchronous framework: stopping
times, an Asynchronous Strong Markov property, recurrent and transient states
and irreducible components of asynchronous probabilistic processes. The
asynchrony assumption implies that there is no global totally ordered clock
ruling the system. Instead, time appears as partially ordered and random. We
construct and characterize M2CP through a finite family of transition matrices.
M2CP have a local independence property that guarantees that local components
are independent in the probabilistic sense, conditionally to their
synchronization constraints. A synchronization product of two Markov chains is
introduced, as a natural example of M2CP."
"Ultrasonic motors used in high-precision mechatronics are characterized by
strong frictional effects, which are among the main problems in precision
motion control. The traditional methods apply model-based nonlinear feedforward
to compensate the friction, thus requiring closed-loop stability and safety
constraint considerations. Implementation of these methods requires complex
designed experiments. This paper introduces a systematic approach using
piecewise affine models to emulate the friction effect of the motor motion. The
well-known model predictive control method is employed to deal with piecewise
affine models. The increased complexity of the model offers a higher tracking
precision on a simpler gain scheduling scheme."
"Ratio control for two interacting processes is proposed with a PID
feedforward design based on model predictive control (MPC) scheme. At each
sampling instant, the MPC control action minimizes a state-dependent
performance index associated with a PID-type state vector, thus yielding a
PID-type control structure. Compared to the standard MPC formulations with
separated single-variable control, such a control action allows one to take
into account the non-uniformity of the two process outputs. After reformulating
the MPC control law as a PID control law, we provide conditions for prediction
horizon and weighting matrices so that the closed-loop control is
asymptotically stable, and show the effectiveness of the approach with
simulation and experiment results."
"In chemical process applications, model predictive control effectively deals
with input and state constraints during transient operations. However,
industrial PID controllers directly manipulates the actuators, so they play the
key role in small perturbation robustness. This paper considers the problem of
augmenting the commonplace PID with the constraint handling and optimization
functionalities of MPC. First, we review the MPC framework, which employs a
linear feedback gain in its unconstrained region. This linear gain can be any
preexisting multiloop PID design, or based on the two stabilizing PI or PID
designs for multivariable systems proposed in the paper. The resulting
controller is a feedforward PID mapping, a straightforward form without the
need of tuning PID to fit an optimal input. The parametrized solution of MPC
under constraints further leverages a familiar PID gain scheduling structure.
Steady state robustness is achieved along with the PID design so that
additional robustness analysis is avoided."
"As far as the identification of linear time-invariant state-space
representation is concerned, among all of the solutions available in the
literature, the subspace-based state-space model identification techniques have
proved their efficiency in many practical cases since the beginning of the
90's. This paper introduces an overview of these techniques by focusing on
their formulation as a least-squares problem. Apart from an article written by
J. Qin, to the author's knowledge, such a regression formulation is not totally
investigated in the books which can be considered as the references as far as
subspace-based identification is concerned. Thus, in this paper, a specific
attention is payed to the regression-based techniques used to identify systems
working under open-loop as well as closed-loop conditions."
"We have recently proposed a ""surplus-based"" algorithm which solves the
multi-agent average consensus problem on general strongly connected and static
digraphs. The essence of that algorithm is to employ an additional variable to
keep track of the state changes of each agent, thereby achieving averaging even
though the state sum is not preserved. In this note, we extend this approach to
the more interesting and challenging case of time-varying topologies: An
extended surplus-based averaging algorithm is designed, under which a necessary
and sufficient graphical condition is derived that guarantees state averaging.
The derived condition requires only that the digraphs be arbitrary strongly
connected in a \emph{joint} sense, and does not impose ""balanced"" or
""symmetric"" properties on the network topology, which is therefore more general
than those previously reported in the literature."
"The recently introduced semi-quasi-Z-source in- verter can be interpreted as
a DC-DC converter whose input- output voltage gain may take any value between
minus infinity and 1 depending on the applied duty cycle. In order to generate
a sinusoidal voltage waveform at the output of this converter, a time-varying
duty cycle needs to be applied. Application of a time-varying duty cycle that
produces large-signal behavior requires careful consideration of stability
issues. This paper provides stability results for both the large-signal
averaged and the switched models of the semi-quasi-Z-source inverter operating
in continuous conduction mode. We show that if the load is linear and purely
resistive then the boundedness and ultimate boundedness of the state
trajectories is guaranteed provided some reasonable operation conditions are
ensured. These conditions amount to keeping the duty cycle away from the
extreme values 0 or 1 (averaged and switched models), and limiting the maximum
PWM switching period (switched model). The results obtained can be used to give
theoretical justification to the inverter operation strategy recently proposed
by Cao et al. in [1]."
"We introduce novel diffusion based adaptive estimation strategies for
distributed networks that have significantly less communication load and
achieve comparable performance to the full information exchange configurations.
After local estimates of the desired data is produced in each node, a single
bit of information (or a reduced dimensional data vector) is generated using
certain random projections of the local estimates. This newly generated data is
diffused and then used in neighboring nodes to recover the original full
information. We provide the complete state-space description and the mean
stability analysis of our algorithms."
"We identify a new observability concept, called relative observability, in
supervisory control of discrete-event systems under partial observation. A
fixed, ambient language is given, relative to which observability is tested.
Relative observability is stronger than observability, but enjoys the important
property that it is preserved under set union; hence there exists the supremal
relatively observable sublanguage of a given language. Relative observability
is weaker than normality, and thus yields, when combined with controllability,
a generally larger controlled behavior; in particular, no constraint is imposed
that only observable controllable events may be disabled. We design algorithms
which compute the supremal relatively observable (and controllable) sublanguage
of a given language, which is generally larger than the normal counterparts. We
demonstrate the new observability concept and algorithms with a Guideway and an
AGV example."
"The paper is devoted to the approximate consensus problem for networks of
nonlinear agents with switching topology, noisy and delayed measurements. In
contrast to the existing stochastic approximation-based control algorithms
(protocols), a local voting protocol with nonvanishing step size is proposed.
Nonvanishing (e.g., constant) step size protocols give the opportunity to
achieve better convergence rate (by choosing proper step sizes) in coping with
time-varying loads and agent states. The price to pay is replacement of the
mean square convergence with an approximate one. To analyze dynamics of the
closed loop system, the so-called method of averaged models is used. It allows
to reduce analysis complexity of the closed loop system. In this paper the
upper bounds for mean square distance between the initial system and its
approximate averaged model are proposed. The proposed upper bounds are used to
obtain conditions for approximate consensus achievement.
  The method is applied to the load balancing problem in stochastic dynamic
networks with incomplete information about the current states of agents and
with changing set of communication links. The load balancing problem is
formulated as consensus problem in noisy model with switched topology. The
conditions to achieve the optimal level of load balancing (in the sense that if
no new task arrives, all agents will finish at the same time) are obtained.
  The performance of the system is evaluated analytically and by simulation. It
is shown that the performance of the adaptive multi-agent strategy with the
redistribution of tasks among ""connected"" neighbors is significantly better
than the performance without redistribution. The obtained results are important
for control of production networks, multiprocessor, sensor or multicomputer
networks, etc."
"In fact, information systems are the foundation of new productivity sources,
medical organizational forms, and erection of a global economy. IoT based
healthcare systems play a significant role in ICT and have contribution in
growth of medical information systems, which are underpinning of recent medical
and economic development strategies. However, to take advantages of IoT, it is
essential that medical enterprises and community should trust the IoT systems
in terms of performance, security, privacy, reliability and
return-on-investment, which are open challenges of current IoT systems. For
heightening of healthcare system; tracking, tracing and monitoring of patients
and medical objects are more essential. But due to the inadequate healthcare
situation, medical environment, medical technologies and the unique
requirements of some healthcare applications, the obtainable tools cannot meet
them accurately. The tracking, tracing and monitoring of patients and
healthcare actors activities in healthcare system are challenging research
directions for IoT researchers. State-of-the-art IoT based healthcare system
should be developed which ensure the safety of patients and other healthcare
activities. With this manuscript, we elaborate the essential role of IoT in
healthcare systems; immense prospects of Internet of things in healthcare
systems; extensive aspect of the use of IoT is dissimilar among different
healthcare components and finally the participation of IoT between the useful
research and present realistic applications. IoT and few other modern
technologies are still in underpinning stage; mainly in the healthcare system."
"In this paper we concern ourselves with the problem of minimizing the standby
power consumption in some of the house hold appliances. Here we propose a
remote controlled device through which we could reduce the amount of standby
power consumed by the electrical appliances connected to it. This device
provides an option of controlling each of the appliances connected to it
individually or as a whole when required. The device has got number of plug
points each of which could be controlled through the remote and also has a
provision of switching off all the points at once."
"This paper presents a new robust fault and state estimation based on
recursive least square filter for linear stochastic systems with unknown
disturbances. The novel elements of the algorithm are : a simple, easily
implementable, square root method which is shown to solve the numerical
problems affecting the unknown input filter algorithm and related information
filter and smoothing algorithms; an iterative framework, where information and
covariance filters and smoothing are sequentially run in order to estimate the
state and fault. This method provides a direct estimate of the state and fault
in a single block with a simple formulation. A numerical example is given in
order to illustrate the performance of the proposed filter."
"In this paper, a Fault-Tolerant control of 2 DOF Helicopter (TRMS System)

the paper presented and a polytypic Unknown Input Observer (UIO) is synthesized
using equalities and LMIs. This UIO is used to observe the faults and then
compensate them, in this part the shown how to design a fault-tolerant control
strategy for this particular class of non-linear systems."
"Timely recognition of voltage instability is crucial to allow for effective
control and protection interventions. Phasor measurements units (PMUs) can be
utilized to provide high sampling rate time-synchronized voltage and current
phasors suitable for wide-area voltage instability detection. However, PMU data
contains unwanted measurement errors and noise, which may affect the results of
applications using these measurements for voltage instability detection. The
aim of this article is to revisit a sensitivities calculation to detect voltage
instability by applying a method utilizing linear regression for preprocessing
PMU data. The methodology is validated using both real-time
hardware-in-the-loop simulation and real PMU measurements from Norwegian
network."
"In a leader-follower multi-agent system (MAS), the leader agents act as
control inputs and influence the states of the remaining follower agents. The
rate at which the follower agents converge to their desired states, as well as
the errors in the follower agent states prior to convergence, are determined by
the choice of leader agents. In this paper, we study leader selection in order
to minimize convergence errors experienced by the follower agents, which we
define as a norm of the distance between the follower agents' intermediate
states and the convex hull of the leader agent states. By introducing a novel
connection to random walks on the network graph, we show that the convergence
error has an inherent supermodular structure as a function of the leader set.
Supermodularity enables development of efficient discrete optimization
algorithms that directly approximate the optimal leader set, provide provable
performance guarantees, and do not rely on continuous relaxations. We formulate
two leader selection problems within the supermodular optimization framework,
namely, the problem of selecting a fixed number of leader agents in order to
minimize the convergence error, as well as the problem of selecting the
minimum-size set of leader agents to achieve a given bound on the convergence
error. We introduce algorithms for approximating the optimal solution to both
problems in static networks, dynamic networks with known topology
distributions, and dynamic networks with unknown and unpredictable topology
distributions. Our approach is shown to provide significantly lower convergence
errors than existing random and degree-based leader selection methods in a
numerical study."
"In this note, the distributed consensus corrupted by relative-state-dependent
measurement noises is considered. Each agent can measure or receive its
neighbors' state information with random noises, whose intensity is a vector
function of agents' relative states. By investigating the structure of this
interaction and the tools of stochastic differential equations, we develop
several small consensus gain theorems to give sufficient conditions in terms of
the control gain, the number of agents and the noise intensity function to
ensure mean square (m. s.) and almost sure (a. s.) consensus and quantify the
convergence rate and the steady-state error. Especially, for the case with
homogeneous communication and control channels, a necessary and sufficient
condition to ensure m. s. consensus on the control gain is given and it is
shown that the control gain is independent of the specific network topology,
but only depends on the number of nodes and the noise coefficient constant. For
symmetric measurement models, the almost sure convergence rate is estimated by
the Iterated Logarithm Law of Brownian motions."
"This paper presents a new algorithm for personal identification from their
Electrocardiograms (ECG) which is based on morphological descriptors and
Hermite Polynomials Expansion coefficients (HPEc). After preprocessing, we
extracted ten morphological descriptors which were divided into homogeneous
groups (amplitude, surface interval and slope) and we extracted sixty Hermite
Polynomials Expansion coefficients(HPEc) from each heartbeat. For the
classification, we employed a binary Support Vector Machines with Gaussian
kernel and we adopted a particular strategy: we first classified groups of
morphological descriptors separately then we combined them in one system. On
the other hand, we classified the Hermite Polynomials Expansion coefficients
apart and we associated them with all groups of morphological descriptors in a
single system in order to improve overall performance. We tested our algorithm
on 18 different healthy signals of the MIT_BIH database. The analysis of
different groups separately showed that the best recognition performance is
96.45% for all morphological descriptors and the results of experiments showed
that the proposed hybrid approach has led to an overall maximum of 98.97%."
"In the recent past, wireless controlled vehicles had been extensively used in
a lot of areas like unmanned rescue missions, military usage for unmanned
combat and many others. But the major disadvantage of these wireless unmanned
robots is that they typically make use of RF circuits for maneuver and control.
Essentially RF circuits suffer from a lot of drawbacks such as limited
frequency range i.e. working range, and limited control. To overcome such
problems associated with RF control, few papers have been written, describing
methods which make use of the GSM network and the DTMF function of a cell phone
to control the robotic vehicle. This paper although uses the same principle
technology of the GSM network and the DTMF based mobile phone but it
essentially shows the construction of a circuit using only 4 bits of wireless
data communication to control the motion of the vehicle without the use of any
microcontroller. This improvement results in considerable reduction of circuit
complexity and of manpower for software development as the circuit built using
this system does not require any form of programming. Moreover, practical
results obtained showed an appreciable degree of accuracy of the system and
friendliness without the use of any microcontroller."
"In this paper, a circuit employing current controlled current conveyor
trans-conductance amplifiers (CCCCTAs) as active element is proposed which can
function both as biquad filter and oscillator. It uses two CCCCTAs and two
capacitors. As a biquad filter it can realizes all the standard filtering
functions (low pass, band pass, high pass, band reject and all pass) in
voltage-mode and provides the feature of electronically and orthogonal control
of pole frequency and quality factor through biasing current(s) of CCCCTAs. The
proposed circuit can also be worked as oscillator without changing the circuit
topology. Without any resistors and using capacitors, the proposed circuit is
suitable for IC fabrication. The validity of proposed filter is verified
through PSPICE simulations."
"Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to
distributed control of discrete-event systems in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory
control framework. Its essence is the decomposition of monolithic (global)
control action into local control strategies for the individual agents. In this
paper, we establish a counterpart supervisor localization theory in the
framework of State Tree Structures, known to be efficient for control design of
very large systems. In the new framework, we introduce the new concepts of
local state tracker, local control function, and state-based local-global
control equivalence. As before, we prove that the collective localized control
behavior is identical to the monolithic optimal (i.e. maximally permissive) and
nonblocking controlled behavior. In addition, we propose a new and more
efficient localization algorithm which exploits BDD computation. Finally we
demonstrate our localization approach on a model for a complex semiconductor
manufacturing system."
"This paper is concerned with the decentralized stabilization problem for a
class of uncertain large-scale systems with Markovian jump parameters. The
controllers use local subsystem states and neighboring mode information to
generate local control inputs. A sufficient condition involving rank
constrained linear matrix inequalities is proposed for the design of such
controllers. A numerical example is given to illustrate the developed theory."
"Now-a-days, a lot of research is being carried out in the development of USVs
(Unmanned surface vehicles), UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) etc. Now in case
of USVs generally, we have seen that wireless controlled vehicles use RF
circuits which suffer from many drawbacks such as limited working range,
limited frequency range and limited control. Moreover shooting infrared
outdoors on a bright sunny day is often problematic, since sunlight can
interfere with the infrared signal. Use of a GSM network (in the form of a
mobile phone, a cordless phone) for robotic control can overcome these
limitations. It provides the advantages of robust control, working range as
large as the coverage area of the service provider in comparison with that of
an IR system, no interference with other controllers. This paper presents a
Global System for Mobile Telecommunication (GSM) network based system which can
be used to remotely send streams of 4 bit data for control of USVs.
Furthermore, this paper describes the usage of the Dual Tone Multi-Frequency
(DTMF) function of the phone, and builds a microcontroller based circuit to
control the vehicle to demonstrate wireless data communication. Practical
result obtained showed an appreciable degree of accuracy of the system and
friendliness through the use of a microcontroller."
"The aim of this research is to design a PID Controller using particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm for multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The conventional gain tuning of PID controller (such
as Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) method) usually produces a big overshoot, and therefore
modern heuristics approach such as PSO are employed to enhance the capability
of traditional techniques. However, due to the computational efficiency, only
PSO will be used in this paper. The results show the advantage of the PID
tuning using PSO-based optimization approach."
"We address the traffic light control problem for a single intersection by
viewing it as a stochastic hybrid system and developing a Stochastic Flow Model
(SFM) for it. We adopt a quasi-dynamic control policy based on partial state
information defined by detecting whether vehicle backlog is above or below a
certain threshold, without the need to observe an exact vehicle count. The
policy is parameterized by green and red cycle lengths which depend on this
partial state information. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we
derive online gradient estimators of an average traffic congestion metric with
respect to these controllable green and red cycle lengths when the vehicle
backlog is above or below the threshold. The estimators are used to iteratively
adjust light cycle lengths so as to improve performance and, in conjunction
with a standard gradient-based algorithm, to seek optimal values which adapt to
changing traffic conditions. Simulation results are included to illustrate the
approach and quantify the benefits of quasidynamic traffic light control over
earlier static approaches."
"The process of anesthesia is nonlinear with time delay and also there are
some constraints which have to be considered in calculating administrative drug
dosage. We present an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) observer to estimate drug
concentration in the patient's body and use this estimation in a state-space
based Model of Predictive Controller (MPC) for controlling the depth of
anesthesia. Bispectral Index (BIS) is used as a patient consciousness index and
propofol as an anesthetic agent. Performance evaluations of the proposed
controller, the results have been compared with those of a MPC controller. The
results demonstrate that state-space MPC including the EKF estimator for
controlling the anesthesia process can significantly increase the robustness in
encountering patients' delay deviations in comparison with the MPC."
"An online, adaptive method of time delay and magnitude estimation for
sinusoidal signals is presented. The method is based on an adaptive gradient
descent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two
noisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel quadrature carrier
generator to produce the carriers for an adaptive quadrature phase detector,
which in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay. The proposed
method is quite robust and can adapt to significant variation in input signal
characteristics like magnitude and frequency imposing no requirement on the
magnitudes of the two signals. It even works effectively when the signals have
time-varying magnitudes. The convergence analysis of the proposed technique
shows that estimate converges exponentially fast to their nominal values. In
addition, if the technique is implemented in the continuous time domain, the
delay estimation accuracy will not be constrained by the sampling frequency as
observed in some of the classical techniques. Extensive simulations show that
the proposed method provides very accurate estimates of the time delay
comparable to that of the popular methods like Sinc-based estimator, Lagrange
estimator, and the Quadrature estimator, as well the magnitude estimate of the
input signals at lower signal to noise ratio at appreciably reduced
computational cost."
"The problem of robustly, asymptotically stabilizing a point (or a set) with
two output-feedback hybrid controllers is considered. These control laws may
have different objectives, e.g., the closed-loop systems resulting with each
controller may have different attractors. We provide a control algorithm that
combines the two hybrid controllers to accomplish the stabilization task. The
algorithm consists of a hybrid supervisor that, based on the values of plant's
outputs and (norm) state estimates, selects the hybrid controller that should
be applied to the plant. The accomplishment of the stabilization task relies on
an output-to-state stability property induced by the controllers, which enables
the construction of an estimator for the norm of the plant's state. The
algorithm is motivated by and applied to robust, semi-global stabilization
problems uniting two controllers."
"As the number of charging Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) increase, due to
the limited power capacity of the distribution feeders and the sensitivity of
the mid-way distribution transformers to the excessive load, it is crucial to
control the amount of power through each specific distribution feeder to avoid
system overloads that may lead to breakdowns. In this paper we develop, analyze
and evaluate charging algorithms for PEVs with feeder overload constraints in
the distribution grid. The algorithms we propose jointly minimize the variance
of the aggregate load and prevent overloading of the distribution feeders."
"In this paper, tall discrete-time linear systems with multirate outputs are
studied. In particular, we focus on their zeros. In systems and control
literature zeros of multirate systems are defined as those of their
corresponding time-invariant blocked systems. Hence, the zeros of tall blocked
systems resulting from blocking of linear systems with multirate outputs are
mainly explored in this work. We specifically investigate zeros of tall blocked
systems formed by blocking tall multirate linear systems with generic parameter
matrices. It is demonstrated that tall blocked systems generically have no
finite nonzero zeros; however, they may have zeros at the origin or at infinity
depending on the choice of blocking delay and the input, state and output
dimensions."
"The concept of controlling non-linear systems is one the significant fields
in scientific researches for the purpose of which intelligent approaches can
provide desirable applicability. Fuzzy systems are systems with ambiguous
definition and fuzzy control is an especial type of non-linear control. Inverse
pendulum system is one the most widely popular non-linear systems which is
known for its specific characteristics such as being intrinsically non-linear
and unsteady. Therefore, a controller is required for maintaining stability of
the system Present study tries to compare the obtained results from designing
fuzzy intelligent controllers in similar conditions and also identify the
appropriate controller for holding the inverse pendulum in vertical position on
the cart."
"Networked Embedded Control Systems are distributed control systems where the
communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a
shared network. They have been the subject of intensive study in the last few
years. In this paper we survey our contribution to this research topic."
"In this work, we continue our study on discrete abstractions of dynamical
systems. To this end, we use a family of partitioning functions to generate an
abstraction. The intersection of sub-level sets of the partitioning functions
defines cells, which are regarded as discrete objects. The union of cells makes
up the state space of the dynamical systems. Our construction gives rise to a
combinatorial object - a timed automaton. We examine sound and complete
abstractions. An abstraction is said to be sound when the flow of the time
automata covers the flow lines of the dynamical systems. If the dynamics of the
dynamical system and the time automaton are equivalent, the abstraction is
complete.
  The commonly accepted paradigm for partitioning functions is that they ought
to be transversal to the studied vector field. We show that there is no
complete partitioning with transversal functions, even for particular dynamical
systems whose critical sets are isolated critical points. Therefore, we allow
the directional derivative along the vector field to be non-positive in this
work. This considerably complicates the abstraction technique. For
understanding dynamical systems, it is vital to study stable and unstable
manifolds and their intersections. These objects appear naturally in this work.
Indeed, we show that for an abstraction to be complete, the set of critical
points of an abstraction function shall contain either the stable or unstable
manifold of the dynamical system."
"This study proposes a feedback linearisation based on the back-stepping
method with simple implementation and unique design process to design a
non-linear controller with a goal of improving both steady-state and transient
stability. The proposed method is designed based on a standard third-order
model of synchronous generator. A comparison based on simulation is then
performed between the proposed method and two conventional control schemes
(i.e. conventional power system stabiliser and direct feedback linearisation).
The simulation results demonstrate that fast response, robustness, damping,
steady-state and transient stability as well as voltage regulation are all
achieved satisfactorily."
"This article describes the application of a credible autocoding framework for
control systems towards a nonlinear car controller example. The framework
generates code, along with guarantees of high level functional properties about
the code that can be independently verified. These high-level functional
properties not only serves as a certificate of good system behvaior but also
can be used to guarantee the absence of runtime errors. In one of our previous
works, we have constructed a prototype autocoder with proofs that demonstrates
this framework in a fully automatic fashion for linear and quasi-nonlinear
controllers. With the nonlinear car example, we propose to further extend the
prototype's dataflow annotation language environment with with several new
annotation symbols to enable the expression of general predicates and dynamical
systems. We demonstrate manually how the new extensions to the prototype
autocoder work on the car controller using the output language Matlab. Finally,
we discuss the requirements and scalability issues of the automatic analysis
and verification of the documented output code."
"The problem of stationary robust L_infinity-induced deconvolution filtering
for the uncertain continuous-time linear stochastic systems is addressed. The
state space model of the system contains state- and input-dependent noise and
deterministic parameter uncertainties residing in a given polytope. In the
presence of input-dependent noise, we extend the derived lemma in Berman and
Shaked (2010) characterizing the induced L_infinity norm by linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs), according to which we solve the deconvolution problem in
the quadratic framework. By decoupling product terms between the Lyapunov
matrix and system matrices, an improved version of the proposed
L_infinity-induced norm bound lemma for continuous-time stochastic systems is
obtained, which allows us to realize exploit parameter-dependent stability idea
in the deconvolution filter design. The theories presented are utilized for
sensor fault reconstruction in uncertain linear stochastic systems. The
effectiveness and advantages of the proposed design methods are shown via two
numerical examples."
"We analyzed the cross-correlation of Photovoltaic (PV) output fluctuation for
the actual PV output time series data in both the Tokyo area and the whole of
Japan using the principal component analysis with the random matrix theory.
Based on the obtained cross-correlation coefficients, the forecast error for PV
output was estimated with/without considering the cross-correlations. Then
operation schedule of thermal plants is calculated to integrate PV output using
our unit commitment model with the estimated forecast error. The cost for grid
integration of PV system was also estimated. Finally, validity of the concept
of ""local production for local consumption of renewable energy"" and alternative
policy implications were also discussed."
"We study a new variant of consensus problems, termed `local average
consensus', in networks of agents. We consider the task of using sensor
networks to perform distributed measurement of a parameter which has both
spatial (in this paper 1D) and temporal variations. Our idea is to maintain
potentially useful local information regarding spatial variation, as contrasted
with reaching a single, global consensus, as well as to mitigate the effect of
measurement errors. We employ two schemes for computation of local average
consensus: exponential weighting and uniform finite window. In both schemes, we
design local average consensus algorithms to address first the case where the
measured parameter has spatial variation but is constant in time, and then the
case where the measured parameter has both spatial and temporal variations. Our
designed algorithms are distributed, in that information is exchanged only
among neighbors. Moreover, we analyze both spatial and temporal frequency
responses and noise propagation associated with the algorithms. The tradeoffs
of using local consensus, as compared to standard global consensus, include
higher memory requirement and degraded noise performance. Arbitrary updating
weights and random spacing between sensors are analyzed in the proposed
algorithms."
"This paper considers the distributed H-infinity leader-following tracking
problem for a class of discrete time multi-agent systems with a
high-dimensional dynamic leader. It is assumed that output information about
the leader is only available to designated followers, and the dynamics of the
followers are subject to perturbations. To achieve distributed H-infinity
leader-following tracking, a new class of control protocols is proposed which
is based on the feedback from the nearest neighbors as well as a distributed
state estimator. Under the assumptions that dynamics of the leader are
detectable and the communication topology contains a directed spanning tree,
sufficient conditions are obtained that enable all followers to track the
leader while achieving a desired H-infinity leader-following tracking
performance. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the
theoretical analysis."
"This is a draft of summary of multi-model algorithm of extended object
tracking based on random matrix (RMF-MM)."
"In this paper, we present a domain specific process to assist the
verification of observer-based fault detection software. Observer-based fault
detection systems, like control systems, yield invariant properties of
quadratic types. These quadratic invariants express both safety properties of
the software such as the boundedness of the states and correctness properties
such as the absence of false alarms from the fault detector. We seek to
leverage these quadratic invariants, in an automated fashion, for the formal
verification of the fault detection software. The approach, referred to as the
credible autocoding framework [1], can be characterized as autocoding with
proofs. The process starts with the fault detector model, along with its safety
and correctness properties, all expressed formally in a synchronous modeling
environment such as Simulink. The model is then transformed by a prototype
credible autocoder into both code and analyzable annotations for the code. We
demonstrate the credible autocoding process on a running example of an output
observer fault detector for a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3DOF) helicopter control
system."
"The paper tailors the so-called wave-based control popular in the field of
flexible mechanical structures to the field of distributed control of vehicular
platoons. The proposed solution augments the symmetric bidirectional control
algorithm with a wave-absorbing controller implemented on the leader, and/or on
the rear-end vehicle. The wave-absorbing controller actively absorbs an
incoming wave of positional changes in the platoon and thus prevents
oscillations of inter-vehicle distances. The proposed controller significantly
improves the performance of platoon manoeuvrers such as
acceleration/deceleration or changing the distances between vehicles without
making the platoon string unstable. Numerical simulations show that the
wave-absorbing controller performs efficiently even for platoons with a large
number of vehicles, for which other platooning algorithms are inefficient or
require wireless communication between vehicles."
"This paper deals with the problem of enforcing modular diagnosability for
discrete-event systems that don't satisfy this property by their natural
modularity. We introduce an approach to achieve this property combining
existing modules into new virtual modules. An underlining mathematical problem
is to find a partition of a set, such that the partition satisfies the required
property. The time complexity of such problem is very high. To overcome it, the
paper introduces a structural analysis of the system's modules. In the analysis
we focus on the case when the modules participate in diagnosis with their
observations, rather then the case when indistinguishable observations are
blocked due to concurrency."
"While the asymptotic stability of positive linear systems in the presence of
bounded time delays has been thoroughly investigated, the theory for nonlinear
positive systems is considerably less well-developed. This paper presents a set
of conditions for establishing delay-independent stability and bounding the
decay rate of a significant class of nonlinear positive systems which includes
positive linear systems as a special case. Specifically, when the time delays
have a known upper bound, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
exponential stability of (a) continuous-time positive systems whose vector
fields are homogeneous and cooperative, and (b) discrete-time positive systems
whose vector fields are homogeneous and order preserving. We then present
explicit expressions that allow us to quantify the impact of delays on the
decay rate and show that the best decay rate of positive linear systems that
our bounds provide can be found via convex optimization. Finally, we extend the
results to general linear systems with time-varying delays."
"The Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is used in this paper to control
the voltage profiles in MV networks with distributed generation. The proposed
algorithm lies at the intermediate level of a three-layer hierarchical
structure. At the upper level a static Optimal Power Flow (OPF) manager
computes the required voltage profiles to be transmitted to the MPC level,
while at the lower level local Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR), one for each
Distributed Generator (DG), track the reactive power reference values computed
by MPC. The control algorithm is based on an impulse response model of the
system, easily obtained by means of a detailed simulator of the network, and
allows to cope with constraints on the voltage profiles and/or on the reactive
power flows along the network. If these constraints cannot be satisfied by
acting on the available DGs, the algorithm acts on the On-Load Tap Changing
(OLTC) transformer. A radial rural network with two feeders, eight DGs, and
thirty-one loads is used as case study. The model of the network is implemented
in DIgSILENT PowerFactory, while the control algorithm runs in Matlab. A number
of simulation results is reported to witness the main characteristics and
limitations of the proposed approach."
"Design, architecture and deployment details of a decision support system
engineered to minimize operating costs of compressor stations in a gas network
are presented. The system employs standard simulation software for pipelines,
combined with well known optimization routine for finding optimal station
control profiles in a repetitive way. A list of custom improvements is
presented that make the system capable and robust enough to perform the
optimization tasks. Implementation process is described in detail, covering the
case of handling extra optimality criteria postulated by the user. Benefits
from using the system and lessons learned are presented in the conclusions
section."
"The ultra large multi-agent systems are becoming increasingly popular due to
quick decay of the individual production costs and the potential of speeding up
the solving of complex problems. Examples include nano-robots, or systems of
nano-satellites for dangerous meteorite detection, or cultures of stem cells
for organ regeneration or nerve repair. The topics associated with these
systems are usually dealt within the theories of intelligent swarms or
biologically inspired computation systems. Stochastic models play an important
role and they are based on various formulations of the mechanical statistics.
In these cases, the main assumption is that the swarm elements have a simple
behaviour and that some average properties can be deduced for the entire swarm.
In contrast, complex systems in areas like aeronautics are formed by elements
with sophisticated behaviour, which are even autonomous. In situations like
this, a new approach to swarm coordination is necessary. We present a
stochastic model where the swarm elements are communicating autonomous systems,
the coordination is separated from the component autonomous activity and the
entire swarm can be abstracted away as a piecewise deterministic Markov
process, which constitutes one of the most popular model in stochastic control.
Keywords: ultra large multi-agent systems, system of systems, autonomous
systems, stochastic hybrid systems."
"The goal of this paper is to study the impact of the dynamic nature of bus
voltage magnitudes and phase angles, which constitute the state of the power
system, on the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem. To facilitate
this study, the placement problem is addressed from the perspective of the
electrical structure which, unlike existing work on PMU placement, accounts for
the sensitivity between power injections and nodal phase angle differences
between various buses in the power network. A linear dynamic model captures the
time evolution of system states, and a simple procedure is devised to estimate
the state transition function at each time instant. The placement problem is
formulated as a series (time steps) of binary integer programs, with the goal
to obtain the minimum number of PMUs at each time step for complete network
observability in the absence of zero injection measurements. Experiments are
conducted on several standard IEEE test bus systems. The main thesis of this
study is that, owing to the dynamic nature of the system states, for optimal
power system operation the best one could do is to install a PMU on each bus of
the given network, though it is undesirable from an economic standpoint."
"The classical eigenvalue assignment problem is revisited in this note. We
derive an analytic expression for pole placement which represents a slight
generalization of the celebrated Bass-Gura and Ackermann formulae, and also is
closely related to the modal procedure of Simon and Mitter."
"Posynomials are nonnegative combinations of monomials with possibly
fractional and both positive and negative exponents. Posynomial models are
widely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits,
aerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems
cast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved
efficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric
programming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based
design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying
posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to
determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the
exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem
numerically hard. In this draft, we propose an approach to the identification
of multivariate posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given
large-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking
coefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a
term representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the
representation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root
LASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to
solve the problem via a sequential coordinate-descent scheme, which is suitable
for large-scale implementations."
"We investigate resilient control strategies for linear systems under
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. By DoS attacks we mean interruptions of
communication on measurement (sensor-to-controller) and/or control
(controller-to-actuator) channels carried out by an intelligent adversary. We
characterize the duration of these interruptions under which stability of the
closed-loop system is preserved. The resilient nature of the control descends
from its ability to adapt the sampling rate to the occurrence of the DoS."
"There are numerous advantages of using Electric Vehicles (EVs) as an
alternative method of transportation. However, an increase in EV usage in the
existing residential distribution grid poses problems such as overloading the
existing infrastructure. In this paper, we have modeled and simulated a
residential distribution grid in GridLAB-D (an open-source software tool used
to model, simulate, and analyze power distribution systems) to illustrate the
problems associated with a higher EV market penetration rates in the
residential domain. Power grid upgrades or control algorithms at the
transformer level are required to overcome issues such as transformer
overloading. We demonstrate the method of coordinating EV charging in a
residential distribution grid so as to overcome the overloading problem without
any upgrades in the distribution grid."
"The response time of the smart electrical vehicle (EV) charging
infrastructure is the key index of the system performance. The traffic between
the smart EV charging station and the control center dominates the response
time of the smart charging stations. To accelerate the response of the smart EV
charging station, there is a need for a technology that collects the
information locally and relays it to the control center periodically. To reduce
the traffic between the smart EV charger and the control center, a Power
Information Collector (PIC), capable of collecting all the meters power
information in the charging station, is proposed and implemented in this paper.
The response time is further reduced by pushing the power information to the
control center. Thus, a fast response smart EV charging infrastructure is
achieved to handle the shortage of energy in the local grid."
"In motion Kinematics, it is well-known that the time derivative of a
3x3rotation matrix equals a skew-symmetric matrix multiplied by the rotation
matrix where the skew symmetric matrix is a linear (matrix valued) function of
the angular velocity and the rotation matrix represents the rotating motion of
a frame with respect to a reference frame. The equation is widely used in
engineering, e.g., robotics, control, air/spacecraft modeling, etc. However,
the derivations found in the literature are indirect. Motivated by the fact
that the set of 3x3rotation matrices, i.e., SO(3), is a Lie group, forming a
smooth (differentiable) manifold, we describe the infinitesimal increment of
the rotation matrix in terms of rotation matrices and show that the above
equation immediately follows."
"This paper presents a unique flywheel-based regenerative energy recovery,
storage and release system developed at the author's laboratory. It can recover
and store regenerative energy produced by braking a motion generator with
intermittent rotary velocity such as the rotor of a wind turbogenerator subject
to intermittent intake wind and the axels of electric and hybrid gas-electric
vehicles during frequent coasting and braking. Releasing of the stored
regenerative energy in the flywheel is converted to electricity by the attached
alternator. A proof-of-concept prototype called the SJSU-RBS was designed,
built and tested by author's students with able assistance of a technical staff
in his school."
"Many perceive electric vehicles (EVs) to be eco-environmentally sustainable
because they are free of emissions of toxic and greenhouse gases to the
environment. However, few have questioned the sustainability of the electric
power required to drive these vehicles. This paper presents an in-depth study
that indicates that massive infusion of EVs to our society in a short time span
will likely create a colossal demand for additional electric power generation
much beyond what the US electric power generating industry can provide with its
current generating capacity. Additionally, such demand would result in much
adverse environmental consequences if the current technology of electric power
generation by predominant fossil fuels continues. Other rarely accounted facts
on environmental impacts by EVs are the substantial electric energy required to
produce batteries that drive EVs, and the negative consequences relating to the
recycling of spent batteries."
"In this paper analysis is given to find the third order intermodulation power
given sinusoids are fed into a nonlinear device. A simple expression of the
third order intermodulation power is given for the case that the center
frequencies of the input sinusoids are equally spaced. Further, if the powers
of the signals are equal, the expression becomes a closed form expression. The
analysis will be helpful for communication system engineering in estimating the
adjacent channel interference due to nonlinearity. Numerical results are
presented for various values of (number of input channels). Though the analysis
assumes the input signals to be sinusoids without phase modulation, the third
order intermodulation power estimate serves as a good estimate for link budget
computation purpose. For the case that the center frequencies of the input
sinusoids are not spaced equally, the analysis can still highly likely be
applied if we insert pseudo channels in between the real channels so that all
(real and pseudo) channels are spaced equally (or approximately equally for
approximation). In this case, the pseudo channel powers are set to zero so that
the interference powers due to the pseudo channels will not be included in the
analysis. In other words, the analysis is highly likely applicable without the
constraint of the input channel center frequencies being equally likely.
Simulations are also provided for the case that the input sinusoids are QPSK
modulated."
"This paper presents a unique learning and research experience for students
from mechanical and electrical engineering majors in a course on senior design
projects involving research and development, design and production of a
proof-of-concept electric vehicle, the ZEM (Zero EMissions) vehicle. The ZEM
vehicle combined positive aspects and latest technologies in electric vehicle
design,solar-electric power conversions, and ergonomic human power into one
affordable and environmentally sustainable vehicle for urban transportation.
The 43 mechanical and 10 electrical engineering majors plus 7 students from
business participated in this multidisciplinary project spanned over two
academic years. The students involved in this multiyear endeavor gained
valuable experiences in real-world working environment with multifunctional and
multi-year sub-groups. The success of this new attempt in conducting senior
design projects classes have set a model for faculty members in the authors'
university in conducting similar courses."
"In this paper, we model energy use in commercial buildings using empirical
data captured through sMAP, a campus building data portal at UC Berkeley. We
conduct at-scale experiments in a newly constructed building on campus. By
modulating the supply duct static pressure (SDSP) for the main supply air duct,
we induce a response on the main supply fan and determine how much ancillary
power flexibility can be provided by a typical commercial building. We show
that the consequent intermittent fluctuations in the air mass flow into the
building does not influence the building climate in a human-noticeable way. We
estimate that at least 4 GW of regulation reserve is readily available only
through commercial buildings in the US. Based on predictions this value will
reach to 5.6 GW in 2035. We also show how thermal slack can be leveraged to
provide an ancillary service to deal with transient frequency fluctuations in
the grid. We consider a simplified model of the grid power system with time
varying demand and generation and present a simple control scheme to direct the
ancillary service power flow from buildings to improve on the classical
automatic generation control (AGC)-based approach. Simulation results are
provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for enhancing
grid frequency regulation."
"In this paper, a theoretical foundation for the Quasi Steady-State (QSS)
model in power system long-term stability analysis is developed. Sufficient
conditions under which the QSS model gives accurate approximations of the
long-term stability model in terms of trajectory and !-limit set are derived.
These sufficient conditions provide some physical insights regarding the reason
for the failure of the QSS model. Additionally, several numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the analytical results derived."
"Battery's role in the development of smart grid is gaining greater attention
as an energy storage device that can be integrated with a Photovoltaic (PV)
cell in the distribution circuit. As more PVs are connected to the system, real
power injection to the distribution can cause fluctuation in the voltage. Due
to the rapid fluctuation of the voltage, a more advanced volt-ampere reactive
(VAR) power control scheme on a fast time scale is used to minimize the voltage
deviation on the distribution. Employing both global and local dynamic VAR
control schemes in our previous work, we show the effects of battery placement
on the performance of VAR controls in the example of a single branch radial
distribution circuit. Simulations verify that having battery placement at the
rear in the distribution circuit can provide smaller voltage variations and
higher energy savings than front battery placement when used with dynamic VAR
control algorithms."
"We study the problem of estimating an unknown deterministic signal that is
observed through an unknown deterministic data matrix under additive noise. In
particular, we present a minimax optimization framework to the least squares
problems, where the estimator has imperfect data matrix and output vector
information. We define the performance of an estimator relative to the
performance of the optimal least squares (LS) estimator tuned to the underlying
unknown data matrix and output vector, which is defined as the regret of the
estimator. We then introduce an efficient robust LS estimation approach that
minimizes this regret for the worst possible data matrix and output vector,
where we refrain from any structural assumptions on the data. We demonstrate
that minimizing this worst-case regret can be cast as a semi-definite
programming (SDP) problem. We then consider the regularized and structured LS
problems and present novel robust estimation methods by demonstrating that
these problems can also be cast as SDP problems. We illustrate the merits of
the proposed algorithms with respect to the well-known alternatives in the
literature through our simulations."
"In this paper, several numerical examples to illustrate limitations of Quasi
Steady-State (QSS) model in long-term voltage stability analysis are presented.
In those cases, the QSS model provided incorrect stability assessment. Causes
of failure of the QSS model are explained and analyzed in nonlinear system
framework. Sufficient conditions of the QSS model for correct approximation are
suggested."
"This paper studies the problem of output agreement in networks of nonlinear
dynamical systems under time-varying disturbances, using dynamic diffusive
couplings. Necessary conditions are derived for general networks of nonlinear
systems, and these conditions are explicitly interpreted as conditions relating
the node dynamics and the network topology. For the class of incrementally
passive systems, necessary and sufficient conditions for output agreement are
derived. The approach proposed in the paper lends itself to solve flow control
problems in distribution networks. As a first case study, the internal model
approach is used for designing a controller that achieves an optimal routing
and inventory balancing in a dynamic transportation network with storage and
time-varying supply and demand. It is in particular shown that the time-varying
optimal routing problem can be solved by applying an internal model controller
to the dual variables of a certain convex network optimization problem. As a
second case study, we show that droop-controllers in microgrids have also an
interpretation as internal model controllers."
"The process industry implements many techniques with certain parameters in
its operations to control the working of several actuators on field. Amongst
these actuators, DC motor is a very common machine. The angular position of DC
motor can be controlled to drive many processes such as the arm of a robot. The
most famous and well known controller for such applications is PID controller.
It uses proportional, integral and derivative functions to control the input
signal before sending it to the plant unit. In this paper, another controller
based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) control is examined to replace the PID
controller for controlling the angular position of a DC motor to drive a robot
arm. Simulation is performed in MATLAB after training the neural network
(supervised learning) and it is shown that results are acceptable and
applicable in process industry for reference control applications. The paper
also indicates that the ANN controller can be less complicated and less costly
to implement in industrial control applications as compared to some other
proposed schemes."
"The electrical structure of the power grid is utilized to address the phasor
measurement unit (PMU) placement problem. First, we derive the connectivity
matrix of the network using the resistance distance metric and employ it in the
linear program formulation to obtain the optimal number of PMUs, for complete
network observability without zero injection measurements. This approach was
developed by the author in an earlier work, but the solution methodology to
address the location problem did not fully utilize the electrical properties of
the network, resulting in an ambiguity. In this paper, we settle this issue by
exploiting the coupling structure of the grid derived using the singular value
decomposition (SVD)-based analysis of the resistance distance matrix to solve
the location problem. Our study, which is based on recent advances in complex
networks that promote the electrical structure of the grid over its topological
structure and the SVD analysis which throws light on the electrical coupling of
the network, results in a unified framework for the electrical structure-based
PMU placement. The proposed method is tested on IEEE bus systems, and the
results uncover intriguing connections between the singular vectors and average
resistance distance between buses in the network."
"Exit paths in buildings are designed to minimise evacuation time when the
building is at full capacity. We present an evacuation support system which
does this regardless of the number of evacuees. The core concept is to even-out
congestion in the building by diverting evacuees to less-congested paths in
order to make maximal usage of all accessible routes throughout the entire
evacuation process. The system issues a set of flow-optimal routes using a
capacity-constrained routing algorithm which anticipates evolutions in path
metrics using the concept of ""future capacity reservation"". In order to direct
evacuees in an intuitive manner whilst implementing the routing algorithm's
scheme, we use dynamic exit signs, i.e. whose pointing direction can be
controlled. To make this system practical and minimise reliance on sensors
during the evacuation, we use an evacuee mobility model and make several
assumptions on the characteristics of the evacuee flow. We validate this
concept using simulations, and show how the underpinning assumptions may limit
the system's performance, especially in low-headcount evacuations."
"The aim of this work is to compute a level backstepping control strategy for
a coupled tanks system. The coupled tanks plant is a component included in the
water treatment system of power plants. The nonlinear-model of the process was
designed and implemented in Matlab- Simulink. The advantages of the control
method proposed is that it takes into consideration the nonlinearity which can
be useful for stabilization and a larger operating point with specified
performances. The backstepping control method is computed using the nonlinear
model of the system and the performance was validated on the physical plant."
"Recently we studied communication delay in distributed control of untimed
discrete-event systems based on supervisor localization. We proposed a property
called delay-robustness: the overall system behavior controlled by distributed
controllers with communication delay is logically equivalent to its delay-free
counterpart. In this paper we extend our previous work to timed discrete-event
systems, in which communication delays are counted by a special clock event
{\it tick}. First, we propose a timed channel model and define timed
delay-robustness; for the latter, a polynomial verification procedure is
presented. Next, if the delay-robust property does not hold, we introduce
bounded delay-robustness, and present an algorithm to compute the maximal delay
bound (measured by number of ticks) for transmitting a channeled event.
Finally, we demonstrate delay-robustness on the example of an under-load
tap-changing transformer."
"PageRank is an algorithm introduced in 1998 and used by the Google Internet
search engine. It assigns a numerical value to each element of a set of
hyperlinked documents (that is, web pages) within the World Wide Web with the
purpose of measuring the relative importance of the page. The key idea in the
algorithm is to give a higher PageRank value to web pages which are visited
often by web surfers. On its website, Google describes PageRank as follows:
``PageRank reflects our view of the importance of web pages by considering more
than 500 million variables and 2 billion terms. Pages that are considered
important receive a higher PageRank and are more likely to appear at the top of
the search results."" Today PageRank is a paradigmatic problem of great interest
in various areas, such as information technology, bibliometrics, biology, and
e-commerce, where objects are often ranked in order of importance. This article
considers a distributed randomized approach based on techniques from the area
of Markov chains using a graph representation consisting of nodes and links. We
also outline connections with other problems of current interest to the systems
and control community, which include ranking of control journals, consensus of
multi-agent systems, and aggregation-based techniques."
"Hybrid Bond Graph (HBG) is a Bond Graph-based modelling approach which
provides an effective tool not only for dynamic modeling but also for fault
detection and isolation (FDI) of switching systems. Bond graph (BG) has been
proven useful for FDI for continuous systems. In addition, BG provides the
causal relations between systems variables which allow FDI algorithms to be
developed systematically from the graph. There are many methods that exploit
structural relations and functional redundancy in the system model to find
efficient solutions for the residual generation and residual evaluation steps
in FDI of switching systems. This paper describes two different techniques,
quantitative and qualitative, based on common modelling approach that employs
HBG. In quantitative approach, global analytical redundancy relationships
(GARRs) are derived from the HBG model with a specified causality assignment
procedure. GARRs describe the system behaviour at all of its operating modes.
In qualitative approach, functional redundancy can be captured by a Temporal
Causal Graph (TCG), a directed graph that may include temporal information"
"Blind system identification is known to be an ill-posed problem and without
further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this contribution, we
are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from only output
measurements. We phrase this as a constrained rank minimization problem and
present a relaxed convex formulation to approximate its solution. To make the
problem well posed we assume that the sought input lies in some known linear
subspace."
"We consider the fast monitoring of voltage collapse margin using
synchrophasor measurements at both ends of transmission lines that transfer
power from two generators to two loads. This shows a way to extend the
monitoring of a radial transmission line to multiple transmission lines. The
synchrophasor voltages are combined into a single complex voltage difference
across an area containing the transmission lines that can be monitored in the
same way as a single transmission line. We identify ideal conditions under
which this reduction to the single line case perfectly preserves the margin to
voltage collapse, and give an example that shows that the error under practical
non-ideal conditions is reasonably small."
"The HVAC systems in subway stations are energy consuming giants, each of
which may consume over 10, 000 Kilowatts per day for cooling and ventilation.
To save energy for the HVAC systems, it is critically important to firstly know
the ""load signatures"" of the HVAC system, i.e., the quantity of heat imported
from the outdoor environments and by the passengers respectively in different
periods of a day, which will significantly benefit the design of control
policies. In this paper, we present a novel sensing and learning approach to
identify the load signature of the HVAC system in the subway stations. In
particular, sensors and smart meters were deployed to monitor the indoor,
outdoor temperatures, and the energy consumptions of the HVAC system in
real-time. The number of passengers was counted by the ticket checking system.
At the same time, the cooling supply provided by the HVAC system was inferred
via the energy consumption logs of the HVAC system. Since the indoor
temperature variations are driven by the difference of the loads and the
cooling supply, linear regression model was proposed for the load signature,
whose coefficients are derived via a proposed algorithm . We collected real
sensing data and energy log data from HaiDianHuangZhuang Subway station, which
is in line 4 of Beijing from the duration of July 2012 to Sept. 2012. The data
was used to evaluate the coefficients of the regression model. The experiment
results show typical variation signatures of the loads from the passengers and
from the outdoor environments respectively, which provide important contexts
for smart control policies."
"For sustainability and energy saving, the problem to optimize the control of
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems has attracted great
attentions, but analyzing the signatures of thermal environments and HVAC
systems and the evaluation of the optimization policies has encountered
inefficiency and inconvenient problems due to the lack of public dataset. In
this paper, we present the Subway station Energy and Environment Dataset
(SEED), which was collected from a line of Beijing subway stations, providing
minute-resolution data regarding the environment dynamics (temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) working states and energy consumptions of the HVAC systems
(ventilators, refrigerators, pumps), and hour-resolution data of passenger
flows. We describe the sensor deployments and the HVAC systems for data
collection and for environment control, and also present initial investigation
for the energy disaggregation of HVAC system, the signatures of the thermal
load, cooling supply, and the passenger flow using the dataset."
"Natural gas transmission pipelines are complex systems whose flow
characteristics are governed by challenging non-linear physical behavior. These
pipelines extend over hundreds and even thousands of miles. Gas is typically
injected into the system at a constant rate, and a series of compressors are
distributed along the pipeline to boost the gas pressure to maintain system
pressure and throughput. These compressors consume a portion of the gas, and
one goal of the operator is to control the compressor operation to minimize
this consumption while satisfying pressure constraints at the gas load points.
The optimization of these operations is computationally challenging. Many
pipelines simply rely on the intuition and prior experience of operators to
make these decisions. Here, we present a new geometric programming approach for
optimizing compressor operation in natural gas pipelines. Using models of real
natural gas pipelines, we show that the geometric programming algorithm
consistently outperforms approaches that mimic existing state of practice."
"The area angle is a scalar measure of power system area stress that responds
to line outages within the area and is a combination of synchrophasor
measurements of voltage angles around the border of the area. Both idealized
and practical examples are given to show that the variation of the area angle
for single line outages can be approximately related to changes in the overall
susceptance of the area and the line outage severity."
"The fractional order system, which is described by the fractional order
derivative and integral, has been studied in many engineering areas. Recently,
the concept of fractional order has been generalized to the distributed order
concept, which is a parallel connection of fractional order integrals and
derivatives taken to the infinitesimal limit in delta order. On the other hand,
there are very few numerical methods available for the analysis of distributed
order systems, particularly under stochastic forcing. This paper first proposes
a numerical scheme for analyzing the behavior of a SISO linear system with a
single term distributed order differentiator/integrator using an operational
matrix in the time domain under both deterministic and random forcing. To
assess the stochastic distributed order system, the existing Monte-Carlo,
polynomial chaos and frequency methods are first adopted to the stochastic
distributed order system for comparison. The numerical examples demonstrate the
accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method for analyzing
stochastic distributed order systems."
"For a wireless sensor network (WSN) with a large number of low-cost,
battery-driven, multiple transmission power leveled sensor nodes of limited
transmission bandwidth, then conservation of transmission resources (power and
bandwidth) is of paramount importance. Towards this end, this paper considers
the problem of power scheduling of Kalman filtering for general linear
stochastic systems subject to data packet drops (over a packet-dropping
wireless network). The transmission of the acquired measurement from the sensor
to the remote estimator is realized by sequentially transmitting every single
component of the measurement to the remote estimator in one time period. The
sensor node decides separately whether to use a high or low transmission power
to communicate every component to the estimator across a packet-dropping
wireless network based on the rule that promotes the power scheduling with the
least impact on the estimator mean squared error. Under the customary
assumption that the predicted density is (approximately) Gaussian, leveraging
the statistical distribution of sensor data, the mechanism of power scheduling,
the wireless network effect and the received data, the minimum mean squared
error estimator is derived. By investigating the statistical convergence
properties of the estimation error covariance, we establish, for general linear
systems, both the sufficient condition and the necessary condition guaranteeing
the stability of the estimator."
"Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task
in the development of practical quantum technology. In this paper, we present a
systematic numerical methodology of sampling-based learning control (SLC) for
control design of quantum systems with Hamiltonian uncertainties. The SLC
method includes two steps of ""training"" and ""testing and evaluation"". In the
training step, an augmented system is constructed by sampling uncertainties
according to possible distributions of uncertainty parameters. A gradient flow
based learning and optimization algorithm is adopted to find the control for
the augmented system. In the process of testing and evaluation, a number of
samples obtained through sampling the uncertainties are tested to evaluate the
control performance. Numerical results demonstrate the success of the SLC
approach. The SLC method has potential applications for robust control design
of quantum systems."
"Information from the sky is important for rescue activity in large-scale
disaster or dangerous areas. Observation system using a balloon or an airplane
has been studied as an information gathering system from the sky. A balloon
observation system needs helium gas and relatively long time to be ready. An
airplane observation system can be prepared in a short time and its mobility is
good. However, a long time flight is difficult because of limited amount of
fuel.
  This paper proposes a kite-based observation system that complements
activities of balloon and airplane observation systems by short preparation
time and long time flight. This research aims at construction of the autonomous
flight information gathering system using a tethered flying unit that consists
of the kite and the ground tether line control unit with a winding machine.
This paper reports development of the kite type tethered flying robot and an
autonomous flying control system inspired by how to fly a kite by a human."
"This note presents some numerical examples worked out in order to show the
reader how to implement, within a widely accessible computational setting, the
methodology for achieving zero cancellation in linear multivariable systems
discussed in [1]. The results are evaluated in the light of applicability and
performance of different methods available in the literature."
"This paper studies distributed strategies for average-consensus of arbitrary
vectors in the presence of network interference. We assume that the underlying
communication on any \emph{link} suffers from \emph{additive interference}
caused due to the communication by other agents following their own consensus
protocol. Additionally, no agent knows how many or which agents are interfering
with its communication. Clearly, the standard consensus protocol does not
remain applicable in such scenarios. In this paper, we cast an algebraic
structure over the interference and show that the standard protocol can be
modified such that the average is reachable in a subspace whose dimension is
complimentary to the maximal dimension of the interference subspaces (over all
of the communication links). To develop the results, we use \emph{information
alignment} to align the intended transmission (over each link) to the
null-space of the interference (on that link). We show that this alignment is
indeed invertible, i.e. the intended transmission can be recovered over which,
subsequently, consensus protocol is implemented. That \emph{local} protocols
exist even when the collection of the interference subspaces span the entire
vector space is somewhat surprising."
"Accurate power system state estimation (PSSE) is an essential prerequisite
for reliable operation of power systems. Different from static PSSE, dynamic
PSSE can exploit past measurements based on a dynamical state evolution model,
offering improved accuracy and state predictability. A key challenge is the
nonlinear measurement model, which is often tackled using linearization,
despite divergence and local optimality issues. In this work, a moving-horizon
estimation (MHE) strategy is advocated, where model nonlinearity can be
accurately captured with strong performance guarantees. To mitigate local
optimality, a semidefinite relaxation approach is adopted, which often provides
solutions close to the global optimum. Numerical tests show that the proposed
method can markedly improve upon an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based
alternative."
"Problem Statement: Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) circuits play a
significant role in major recent embedded process control designs. However,
exploiting these platforms requires deep hardware conception skills and remains
an important time consuming stage in a design flow. High Level Synthesis
technique avoids this bottleneck and increases design productivity as witnessed
by industry specialists. Approach: This study proposes to apply this technique
for the conception and implementation of a Real Time Direct Current Machine
(RTDCM) emulator for an embedded control application. Results: Several
FPGA-based configuration scenarios are studied. A series of tests including
design and timing-precision analysis were conducted to discuss and validate the
obtained hardware architectures. Conclusion/Recommendations: The proposed
methodology has accelerated the design time besides it has provided an extra
time to refine the hardware core of the DCM emulator. The high level synthesis
technique can be applied to the control field especially to test with low cost
and short delays newest algorithms and motor models."
"During the last decade with the rapid increase in indoor wireless
communications, location-aware services have received a great deal of attention
for commercial, public-safety, and a military application, the greatest
challenge associated with indoor positioning methods is moving object data and
identification. Mobility tracking and localization are multifaceted problems,
which have been studied for a long time in different contexts. Many potential
applications in the domain of WSNs require such capabilities. The mobility
tracking needs inherent in many surveillance, security and logistic
applications. This paper presents the identification of employees in National
Technical University in Athens (IE-NTUA), when the employees access to a
certain area of the building (enters and leaves to/from the college), Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) applied for identification by offering special
badges containing RFID-tags."
"Optimal control of magnetizing current for minimizing induction motor power
losses during load torque step change was developed. Obtained strategy has
feedback form and is exactly optimal of ideal speed controller performance and
absence of saturation in motor. The impact of limited bandwidth of real speed
controller is analyzed. For case of main induction saturation the sub-optimal
optimal control is suggested. Relative accuracy of sub-optimality is studied.
Hardware implementation of optimal strategy and experimentation conducted with
induction motors under vector control."
"Frequency control reserves are an essential ancillary service in any electric
power system, guaranteeing that generation and demand of active power are
balanced at all times. Traditionally, conventional power plants are used for
frequency reserves. There are economical and technical benefits of instead
using energy constrained units such as storage systems and demand response, but
so far they have not been widely adopted as their energy constraints prevent
them from following traditional regulation signals, which sometimes are biased
over long time-spans. This paper proposes a frequency control framework that
splits the control signals according to the frequency spectrum. This guarantees
that all control signals are zero-mean over well-defined time-periods, which is
a crucial requirement for the usage of energy-constraint units such as
batteries. A case-study presents a possible implementation, and shows how
different technologies with widely varying characteristics can all participate
in frequency control reserve provision, while guaranteeing that their
respective energy constraints are always fulfilled."
"In multi-object stochastic systems, the issue of sensor management is a
theoretically and computationally challenging problem. In this paper, we
present a novel random finite set (RFS) approach to the multi-target sensor
management problem within the partially observed Markov decision process
(POMDP) framework. The multi-target state is modelled as a multi-Bernoulli RFS,
and the multi-Bernoulli filter is used in conjunction with two different
control objectives: maximizing the expected R\'enyi divergence between the
predicted and updated densities, and minimizing the expected posterior
cardinality variance. Numerical studies are presented in two scenarios where a
mobile sensor tracks five moving targets with different levels of
observability."
"Cellular communication becomes the major mode of communication in present
century. With the development of this phase of communication the globalization
process is also in its peak of speed. The development of cellular communication
is largely depending on the improvement and stability of Base Transceiver
Station (BTS) room. So for the purpose of the development of cellular
communication a large numbered BTS rooms are installed throughout the world. To
ensure proper support from BTS rooms there must be a security system to avoid
any unnecessary vulnerability. Therefore multiple alarm system is designed to
secure the BTS rooms from any undesired circumstances. This system is designed
with a PIC Microcontroller as a main controller and a several sensors are
interfaced with it to provide high temperature alarm, smoke alarm, door alarm
and water alarm. All these alarms are interfaced with the alarm box in the BTS
room which provides the current status directly to Network Management Centre
(NMC) of a Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication network."
"Service systems are labor intensive due to the large variation in the tasks
required to address service requests from multiple customers. Aligning the
staffing levels to the forecasted workloads adaptively in such systems is
nontrivial because of a large number of parameters and operational variations
leading to a huge search space. A challenging problem here is to optimize the
staffing while maintaining the system in steady-state and compliant to
aggregate service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Further, because these
parameters change on a weekly basis, the optimization should not take longer
than a few hours. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov cost
process parameterized by the (discrete) staffing levels. We propose novel
simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) based SASOC (Staff
Allocation using Stochastic Optimization with Constraints) algorithms for
solving the above problem. The algorithms include both first order as well as
second order methods and incorporate SPSA based gradient estimates in the
primal, with dual ascent for the Lagrange multipliers. Both the algorithms that
we propose are online, incremental and easy to implement. Further, they involve
a certain generalized smooth projection operator, which is essential to project
the continuous-valued worker parameter tuned by SASOC algorithms onto the
discrete set. We validated our algorithms on five real-life service systems and
compared them with a state-of-the-art optimization tool-kit OptQuest. Being 25
times faster than OptQuest, our algorithms are particularly suitable for
adaptive labor staffing. Also, we observe that our algorithms guarantee
convergence and find better solutions than OptQuest in many cases."
"This technical note studies the distributed average tracking problem for
multiple time-varying signals with general linear dynamics, whose reference
inputs are nonzero and not available to any agent in the network. In
distributed fashion, a pair of continuous algorithms with, respectively, static
and adaptive coupling strengths are designed. Based on the boundary layer
concept, the proposed continuous algorithm with static coupling strengths can
asymptotically track the average of the multiple reference signals without
chattering phenomenon. Furthermore, for the case of algorithms with adaptive
coupling strengths, the average tracking errors are uniformly ultimately
bounded and exponentially converge to a small adjustable bounded set. Finally,
a simulation example is presented to show the validity of the theoretical
results."
"This paper deals with the design of Fractional Order Proportional Integral
(FO-PI{\lambda}) controller for the speed control of DC motor. A mathematical
model of DC motor control system is derived and based on this model fractional
order PI{\lambda} controller is designed using stability boundary locus method
to satisfy required gain margin (GM) and phase margin (PM) of the system. Servo
and Regulatory tracking simulation runs are carried out for the speed control
of DC motor. The performance of the fractional order PI{\lambda}
(FO-PI{\lambda}) controller is compared with Integer Order Relay Feedback
Proportional Integral (IO-RFPI) controller. Finally the stability of both
control system is considered."
"This paper focuses on cascading line failures in the transmission system of
the power grid. Recent large-scale power outages demonstrated the limitations
of percolation- and epid- emic-based tools in modeling cascades. Hence, we
study cascades by using computational tools and a linearized power flow model.
We first obtain results regarding the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the power
grid admittance matrix. Based on these results, we study the impact of a single
line failure on the flows on other lines. We also illustrate via simulation the
impact of the distance and resistance distance on the flow increase following a
failure, and discuss the difference from the epidemic models. We then study the
cascade properties, considering metrics such as the distance between failures
and the fraction of demand (load) satisfied after the cascade (yield). We use
the pseudo-inverse of admittance matrix to develop an efficient algorithm to
identify the cascading failure evolution, which can be a building block for
cascade mitigation. Finally, we show that finding the set of lines whose
removal has the most significant impact (under various metrics) is NP-Hard and
introduce a simple heuristic for the minimum yield problem. Overall, the
results demonstrate that using the resistance distance and the pseudo-inverse
of admittance matrix provides important insights and can support the
development of efficient algorithms."
"Different approaches have been used in the development of system models. In
addition, modeling and simulation approaches are essential for design,
analysis, control, and diagnosis of complex systems. This work presents a
Simulink model for systems with mixed continuous and discrete behaviors. The
model simulated was developed using the bond graph methodology and we model
hybrid systems using hybrid bond graphs (HBGs), that incorporates local
switching functions that enable the reconfiguration of energy flow paths. This
approach has been implemented as a software tool called the MOdeling and
Transformation of HBGs for Simulation (MOTHS) tool suite which incorporates a
model translator that create Simulink models. Simulation model of a three-tank
system that includes a switching component was developed using the bond graph
methodology, and MoTHS software were used to build a Simulink model of the
dynamic behavior."
"Long horizon lengths in Moving Horizon Estimation are desirable to reach the
performance limits of the full information estimator. However, the conventional
MHE technique suffers from a number of deficiencies in this respect. First, the
problem complexity scales at least linearly with the horizon length selected,
which restrains from selecting long horizons if computational limitations are
present. Second, there is no monitoring of constraint activity/inactivity which
results in conducting redundant constrained minimizations even when no
constraints are active. In this study we develop a Multiple-Window Moving
Horizon Estimation strategy (MW-MHE) that exploits constraint inactivity to
reduce the problem size in long horizon estimation problems. The arrival cost
is approximated using the unconstrained full information estimator arrival cost
to guarantee stability of the technique. A new horizon length selection
criteria is developed based on maximum sensitivity between remote states in
time. The development will be in terms of general causal descriptor systems,
which includes the standard state space representation as a special case. The
potential of the new estimation algorithm will be demonstrated with an example
showing a significant reduction in both computation time and numerical errors
compared to conventional MHE."
"A new optimization method for the design of nearly linear-phase IIR digital
filters that satisfy prescribed specifications is proposed. The group-delay
deviation is minimized under the constraint that the passband ripple and
stopband attenuation are within the prescribed specifications and either a
prescribed or an optimized group delay can be achieved. By representing the
filter in terms of a cascade of second-order sections, a non-restrictive
stability constraint characterized by a set of linear inequality constraints
can be incorporated in the optimization algorithm. An additional feature of the
method, which is very useful in certain applications, is that it provides the
capability of constraining the maximum gain in transition bands to be below a
prescribed level. Experimental results show that filters designed using the
proposed method have much lower group-delay deviation for the same passband
ripple and stopband attenuation when compared with corresponding filters
designed with several state-of-the-art competing methods."
"This paper introduces a new behavioral system model with distinct external
and internal signals possibly evolving on different time scales. This allows to
capture abstraction processes or signal aggregation in the context of control
and verification of large scale systems. For this new system model different
notions of simulation and bisimulation are derived, ensuring that they are,
respectively, preorders and equivalence relations for the system class under
consideration. These relations can capture a wide selection of similarity
notions available in the literature. This paper therefore provides a suitable
framework for their comparison"
"This paper constructs a finite state abstraction of a possibly
continuous-time and infinite state model in two steps. First, a finite external
signal space is added, generating a so called $\Phi$-dynamical system.
Secondly, the strongest asynchronous $l$-complete approximation of the external
dynamics is constructed. As our main results, we show that (i) the abstraction
simulates the original system, and (ii) bisimilarity between the original
system and its abstraction holds, if and only if the original system is
$l$-complete and its state space satisfies an additional property."
"The aim of the temperature control is to heat the system up todelimitated
temperature, afterwardhold it at that temperature in insured manner. Fuzzy
Logic Controller (FLC) is best way in which this type of precision control can
be accomplished by controller. During past twenty yearssignificant amount of
research using fuzzy logichas done in this field of control of non-linear
dynamical system. Here we have developed temperature control system using fuzzy
logic. Control theory techniques are the root from which convention controllers
are deducted. The desired response of the output can be guaranteed by the
feedback controller."
"A good state-time quantized symbolic abstraction of an already input
quantized control system would satisfy three conditions: proximity, soundness
and completeness. Extant approaches for symbolic abstraction of unstable
systems limit to satisfying proximity and soundness but not completeness.
Instability of systems is an impediment to constructing fully complete
state-time quantized symbolic models for bounded and quantized input unstable
systems, even using supervisory feedback. Therefore, in this paper we come up
with a way of parametrization of completeness of the symbolic model through the
quintessential notion of Trimmed-Input Approximate Bisimulation which is
introduced in the paper. The amount of completeness is specified by a parameter
called trimming of the set of input trajectories. We subsequently discuss a
procedure of constructing state-time quantized symbolic models which are
near-complete in addition to being sound and proximate with respect to the time
quantized models."
"In this paper, pseudo-transient continuation method has been modified and
implemented in power system long-term stability analysis. This method is a
middle ground between integration and steady state calculation, thus is a good
compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Pseudo-transient continuation
method can be applied in the long-term stability model directly to accelerate
simulation speed and can also be implemented in the QSS model to overcome
numerical difficulties. Numerical examples show that pseudo-transient
continuation method can provide correct approximations for the long-term
stability model in terms of trajectories and stability assessment."
"This paper proposes an effective method for estimating the parameters of
double-cage induction motors by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm.
For this purpose the unknown parameters in the electrical model of asynchronous
machine are calculated such that the sum of the square of differences between
full load torques, starting torques, maximum torques, starting currents, full
load currents, and nominal power factors obtained from model and provided by
manufacturer is minimized. In order to confirm the efficiency of the proposed
method the results are also compared with those achieved by using GA, PSO, and
PAMP. The simulations show that in the problem under consideration ABC
converges considerably faster than other algorithms and the results are as
accurate as PAMP."
"Mean-field models are a popular tool in a variety of fields. They provide an
understanding of the impact of interactions among a large number of particles
or people or other ""self-interested agents"", and are an increasingly popular
tool in distributed control.
  This paper considers a particular randomized distributed control architecture
introduced in our own recent work. In numerical results it was found that the
associated mean-field model had attractive properties for purposes of control.
In particular, when viewed as an input-output system, its linearization was
found to be minimum phase.
  In this paper we take a closer look at the control model. The results are
summarized as follows:
  (i) The Markov Decision Process framework of Todorov is extended to
continuous time models, in which the ""control cost"" is based on relative
entropy. This is the basis of the construction of a family of controlled
Markovian generators.
  (ii) A decentralized control architecture is proposed in which each agent
evolves as a controlled Markov process. A central authority broadcasts a common
control signal to each agent. The central authority chooses this signal based
on an aggregate scalar output of the Markovian agents.
  (iii) Provided the control-free system is a reversible Markov process, the
following identity holds for the linearization, \[ \text{Real} (G(j\omega)) =
\text{PSD}_Y(\omega)\ge 0, \quad \omega\in\Re, \] where the right hand side
denotes the power spectral density for the output of any one of the individual
(control-free) Markov processes."
"A standard approach to optimizing long-run running costs of discrete systems
is based on minimizing the mean-payoff, i.e., the long-run average amount of
resources (""energy"") consumed per transition. However, this approach inherently
assumes that the energy source has an unbounded capacity, which is not always
realistic. For example, an autonomous robotic device has a battery of finite
capacity that has to be recharged periodically, and the total amount of energy
consumed between two successive charging cycles is bounded by the capacity.
Hence, a controller minimizing the mean-payoff must obey this restriction. In
this paper we study the controller synthesis problem for consumption systems
with a finite battery capacity, where the task of the controller is to minimize
the mean-payoff while preserving the functionality of the system encoded by a
given linear-time property. We show that an optimal controller always exists,
and it may either need only finite memory or require infinite memory (it is
decidable in polynomial time which of the two cases holds). Further, we show
how to compute an effective description of an optimal controller in polynomial
time. Finally, we consider the limit values achievable by larger and larger
battery capacity, show that these values are computable in polynomial time, and
we also analyze the corresponding rate of convergence. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first results about optimizing the long-run running
costs in systems with bounded energy stores."
"This paper investigates performance limitations and tradeoffs in the control
design for linear time-invariant systems. It is shown that control
specifications in time domain and in frequency domain are always mutually
exclusive determined by uncertainty relations. The uncertainty principle from
quantum mechanics and harmonic analysis therefore embeds itself inherently in
control theory. The relations among transient specifications, system bandwidth
and control energy are obtained within the framework of uncertainty principle.
If the control system is provided with a large bandwidth or great control
energy, then it can ensure transient specifications as good as it can be. Such
a control system could be approximated by prolate spheroidal wave functions.
The obtained results are also applicable to filter design due to the duality of
filtering and control."
"A number of biological rhythms originate from networks comprised of multiple
cellular oscillators. But analytical results are still lacking on the
collective oscillation period of inter-coupled gene regulatory oscillators,
which, as has been reported, may be different from that of an autonomous
oscillator. Based on cyclic feedback oscillators, we analyze the collective
oscillation pattern of coupled cellular oscillators. First we give a condition
under which the oscillator network exhibits oscillatory and synchronized
behavior. Then we estimate the collective oscillation period based on a novel
multivariable harmonic balance technique. Analytical results are derived in
terms of biochemical parameters, thus giving insight into the basic mechanism
of biological oscillation and providing guidance in synthetic biology design."
"This paper investigates adaptive zero reaction motion control for
free-floating space manipulators with uncertain kinematics and dynamics. The
challenge in deriving the adaptive reaction null-space (RNS) based control
scheme is that it is difficult to obtain a linear expression, which is the
basis of the adaptive control. The main contribution of this paper is that we
skillfully obtain such a linear expression, based on which, an adaptive version
of the RNS-based controller (referred to as the adaptive zero reaction motion
controller in the sequel) is developed at the velocity level, taking into
account both the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties. It is shown that the
proposed controller achieves both the spacecraft attitude regulation and
end-effector trajectory tracking. The performance of the proposed adaptive
controller is shown by numerical simulations with a planar 3-DOF
(degree-of-freedom) space manipulator."
"Navigation satellites are a core component of navigation satellite based
systems such as GPS, GLONASS and Galileo which provide location and timing
information for a variety of uses. Such satellites are designed for operating
on orbit to perform tasks and have lifetimes of 10 years or more. Reliability,
availability and maintainability (RAM) analysis of systems has been
indispensable in the design phase of satellites in order to achieve minimum
failures or to increase mean time between failures (MTBF) and thus to plan
maintenance strategies, optimise reliability and maximise availability. In this
paper, we present formal models of both a single satellite and a navigation
satellite constellation and logical specification of their reliability,
availability and maintainability properties respectively. The probabilistic
model checker PRISM has been used to perform automated analysis of these
quantitative properties."
"A three-dimensional (3D) integrated guidance and control (IGC) design
approach is proposed by using small-gain theorem in this paper. The 3D IGC
model is formulated by combining nonlinear pursuer dynamics with the nonlinear
dynamics describing pursuitevasion motion. Small-gain theorem and ISS theory
are iteratively utilized to design desired attack angle, sideslip angle and
attitude angular rates (virtual controls), and eventually an IGC law is
proposed. Theoretical analysis shows that the IGC approach can make the LOS
rate converge into a small neighborhood of zero, and the stability of the
overall system can be guaranteed as well."
"Social interactions influence our thoughts, opinions and actions. In this
paper, social interactions are studied within a group of individuals composed
of influential social leaders and followers. Each person is assumed to maintain
a social state, which can be an emotional state or an opinion. Followers update
their social states based on the states of local neighbors, while social
leaders maintain a constant desired state. Social interactions are modeled as a
general directed graph where each directed edge represents an influence from
one person to another. Motivated by the non-local property of fractional-order
systems, the social response of individuals in the network are modeled by
fractional-order dynamics whose states depend on influences from local
neighbors and past experiences. A decentralized influence method is then
developed to maintain existing social influence between individuals (i.e.,
without isolating peers in the group) and to influence the social group to a
common desired state (i.e., within a convex hull spanned by social leaders).
Mittag-Leffler stability methods are used to prove asymptotic stability of the
networked fractional-order system."
"This paper extends the $l$-complete approximation method developed for time
invariant systems to a larger system class, ensuring that the resulting
approximation can be realized by a finite state machine. To derive the new
abstraction method, called asynchronous $l$-complete approximation, an
asynchronous version of the well-known concepts of state property, memory span
and $l$-completeness is introduced, extending the behavioral systems theory in
a consistent way."
"A wide range of applications require or can benefit from collaborative
behavior of a group of agents. The technical challenge addressed in this
chapter is the development of a decentralized control strategy that enables
each agent to independently navigate to ensure agents achieve a collective goal
while maintaining network connectivity. Specifically, cooperative controllers
are developed for networked agents with limited sensing and network
connectivity constraints. By modeling the interaction among the agents as a
graph, several different approaches to address the problems of preserving
network connectivity are presented, with the focus on a method that utilizes
navigation function frameworks. By modeling network connectivity constraints as
artificial obstacles in navigation functions, a decentralized control strategy
is presented in two particular applications, formation control and rendezvous
for a system of autonomous agents, which ensures global convergence to the
unique minimum of the potential field (i.e., desired formation or desired
destination) while preserving network connectivity. Simulation results are
provided to demonstrate the developed strategy."
"This paper presents a decentralized hybrid supervisory control approach for a
team of unmanned helicopters that are involved in a leader-follower formation
mission. Using a polar partitioning technique, the motion dynamics of the
follower helicopters are abstracted to finite state machines. Then, a discrete
supervisor is designed in a modular way for different components of the
formation mission including reaching the formation, keeping the formation, and
collision avoidance. Furthermore, a formal technique is developed to design the
local supervisors decentralizedly, so that the team of helicopters as whole,
can cooperatively accomplish a collision-free formation task."
"We investigate the connections between compression learning and scenario
based optimization. We first show how to strengthen, or relax the consistency
assumption at the basis of compression learning and study the learning and
generalization properties of the algorithm involved. We then consider different
constrained optimization problems affected by uncertainty represented by means
of scenarios. We show that the issue of providing guarantees on the probability
of constraint violation reduces to a learning problem for an appropriately
chosen algorithm that enjoys compression learning properties. The compression
learning perspective provides a unifying framework for scenario based
optimization and allows us to revisit the scenario approach and the
probabilistically robust design, a recently developed technique based on a
mixture of randomized and robust optimization, and to extend the guarantees on
the probability of constraint violation to cascading optimization problems."
"Two moment-matching methods for model reduction of linear switched systems
(LSSs) are presented. The methods are similar to the Krylov subspace methods
used for moment matching for linear systems. The more general one of the two
methods, is based on the so called ""nice selection"" of some vectors in the
reachability or observability space of the LSS. The underlying theory is
closely related to the (partial) realization theory of LSSs. In this paper, the
connection of the methods to the realization theory of LSSs is provided, and
algorithms are developed for the purpose of model reduction. Conditions for
applicability of the methods for model reduction are stated and finally the
results are illustrated on numerical examples."
"The efficiency of modern optimization methods, coupled with increasing
computational resources, has led to the possibility of real-time optimization
algorithms acting in safety critical roles. There is a considerable body of
mathematical proofs on on-line optimization programs which can be leveraged to
assist in the development and verification of their implementation. In this
paper, we demonstrate how theoretical proofs of real-time optimization
algorithms can be used to describe functional properties at the level of the
code, thereby making it accessible for the formal methods community. The
running example used in this paper is a generic semi-definite programming (SDP)
solver. Semi-definite programs can encode a wide variety of optimization
problems and can be solved in polynomial time at a given accuracy. We describe
a top-to-down approach that transforms a high-level analysis of the algorithm
into useful code annotations. We formulate some general remarks about how such
a task can be incorporated into a convex programming autocoder. We then take a
first step towards the automatic verification of the optimization program by
identifying key issues to be adressed in future work."
"The importance of pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs) in biology and engineering
has motivated research to understand basic properties of PCO networks. Despite
the large body of work addressing PCOs, a global synchronization result for
networks that are more general than all-to-all connected is still unavailable.
In this paper we address global synchronization of PCO networks described by
cycle graphs. It is shown for the bidirectional cycle case that as the number
of oscillators in the cycle grows, the coupling strength must be increased in
order to guarantee synchronization for arbitrary initial conditions. For the
unidirectional cycle case, the strongest coupling cannot ensure global
synchronization yet a refractory period in the phase response curve is
sufficient to enable global synchronization. Analytical findings are confirmed
by numerical simulations."
"The conventional approach for the control of distribution networks, in the
presence of active generation and/or controllable loads and storage, involves a
combination of both frequency and voltage regulation at different time scales.
With the increased penetration of stochastic resources, distributed generation
and demand response, this approach shows severe limitations in both the optimal
and feasible operation of these networks, as well as in the aggregation of the
network resources for upper-layer power systems. An alternative approach is to
directly control the targeted grid by defining explicit and real-time setpoints
for active/reactive power absorptions/injections defined by a solution of a
specific optimization problem; but this quickly becomes intractable when
systems get large or diverse. In this paper, we address this problem and
propose a method for the explicit control of the grid status, based on a common
abstract model characterized by the main property of being composable. That is
to say, subsystems can be aggregated into virtual devices that hide their
internal complexity. Thus the proposed method can easily cope with systems of
any size or complexity. The framework is presented in this Part I, whilst in
Part II we illustrate its application to a CIGR\'E low voltage benchmark
microgrid. In particular, we provide implementation examples with respect to
typical devices connected to distribution networks and evaluate of the
performance and benefits of the proposed control framework."
"Sequential detection problems in sensor networks are considered. The true
state of nature/true hypothesis is modeled as a binary random variable $H$ with
known prior distribution. There are $N$ sensors making noisy observations about
the hypothesis; $\mathcal{N} =\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$ denotes the set of sensors.
Sensor $i$ can receive messages from a subset $\mathcal{P}^i \subset
\mathcal{N}$ of sensors and send a message to a subset $\mathcal{C}^i \subset
\mathcal{N}$. Each sensor is faced with a stopping problem. At each time $t$,
based on the observations it has taken so far and the messages it may have
received, sensor $i$ can decide to stop and communicate a binary decision to
the sensors in $\mathcal{C}^i$, or it can continue taking observations and
receiving messages. After sensor $i$'s binary decision has been sent, it
becomes inactive. Sensors incur operational costs (cost of taking observations,
communication costs etc.) while they are active. In addition, the system incurs
a terminal cost that depends on the true hypothesis $H$, the sensors' binary
decisions and their stopping times. The objective is to determine decision
strategies for all sensors to minimize the total expected cost."
"FAUST$^2$ is a software tool that generates formal abstractions of (possibly
non-deterministic) discrete-time Markov processes (dtMP) defined over
uncountable (continuous) state spaces. A dtMP model is specified in MATLAB and
abstracted as a finite-state Markov chain or Markov decision processes. The
abstraction procedure runs in MATLAB and employs parallel computations and fast
manipulations based on vector calculus. The abstract model is formally put in
relationship with the concrete dtMP via a user-defined maximum threshold on the
approximation error introduced by the abstraction procedure. FAUST$^2$ allows
exporting the abstract model to well-known probabilistic model checkers, such
as PRISM or MRMC. Alternatively, it can handle internally the computation of
PCTL properties (e.g. safety or reach-avoid) over the abstract model, and
refine the outcomes over the concrete dtMP via a quantified error that depends
on the abstraction procedure and the given formula. The toolbox is available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/faust2/"
"This paper presents an occupancy-predicting control algorithm for heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings. It incorporates
the building's thermal properties, local weather predictions, and a self-tuning
stochastic occupancy model to reduce energy consumption while maintaining
occupant comfort. Contrasting with existing approaches, the occupancy model
requires no manual training and adapts to changes in occupancy patterns during
operation. A prediction-weighted cost function provides conditioning of thermal
zones before occupancy begins and reduces system output before occupancy ends.
Simulation results with real-world occupancy data demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness."
"We propose a stability analysis method for sampled-data switched linear
systems with quantization. The available information to the controller is
limited: the quantized state and switching signal at each sampling time.
Switching between sampling times can produce the mismatch of the modes between
the plant and the controller. Moreover, the coarseness of quantization makes
the trajectory wander around, not approach, the origin. Hence the trajectory
may leave the desired neighborhood if the mismatch leads to instability of the
closed-loop system. For the stability of the switched systems, we develop a
sufficient condition characterized by the total mismatch time. The relationship
between the mismatch time and the dwell time of the switching signal is also
discussed."
"In this paper, we establish a method for model order reduction of a certain
class of physical network systems. The proposed method is based on clustering
of the vertices of the underlying graph, and yields a reduced order model
within the same class. To capture the physical properties of the network, we
allow for weights associated to both the edges as well as the vertices of the
graph. We extend the notion of almost equitable partitions to this class of
graphs. Consequently, an explicit model reduction error expression in the sense
of H2-norm is provided for clustering arising from almost equitable partitions.
Finally the method is extended to second-order systems."
"This paper presents identification of both network connected systems as well
as distributed systems governed by PDEs in the framework of distributed
optimization via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. This approach
opens first the possibility to identify distributed models in a global manner
using all available data sequences and second the possibility for a distributed
implementation. The latter will make the application to large scale complex
systems possible. In addition to outlining a new large scale identification
method, illustrations are shown for identifying both network connected systems
and discretized PDEs."
"We propose and solve a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) problem addressing
the optimal provision of regulation service reserves (RSR) by controlling
dynamic demand preferences in smart buildings. A major contribution over past
dynamic pricing work is that we pioneer the relaxation of static, uniformly
distributed utility of demand. In this paper we model explicitly the dynamics
of energy service preferences leading to a non-uniform and time varying
probability distribution of demand utility. More explicitly, we model active
and idle duty cycle appliances in a smart building as a closed queuing system
with price-controlled arrival rates into the active appliance queue. Focusing
on cooling appliances, we model the utility associated with the transition from
idle to active as a non-uniform time varying function. We (i) derive an
analytic characterization of the optimal policy and the differential cost
function, and (ii) prove optimal policy monotonicity and value function
convexity. These properties enable us to propose and implement a smart assisted
value iteration (AVI) algorithm and an approximate DP (ADP) that exploits
related functional approximations. Numerical results demonstrate the validity
of the solution techniques and the computational advantage of the proposed ADP
on realistic, large-state-space problems."
"In this paper, controllability of systems defined on graphs is discussed. We
consider the problem of controllability of the network for a family of matrices
carrying the structure of an underlying directed graph. A one-to-one
correspondence between the set of leaders rendering the network controllable
and zero forcing sets is established. To illustrate the proposed results,
special cases including path, cycle, and complete graphs are discussed.
Moreover, as shown for graphs with a tree structure, the proposed results of
the present paper together with the existing results on the zero forcing sets
lead to a minimal leader selection scheme in particular cases."
"The joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter is a popular tracking
methodology for problems involving well-spaced targets, but it is rarely
applied in problems with closely-spaced targets due to its complexity in these
cases, and due to the well-known phenomenon of coalescence. This paper
addresses these difficulties using random finite sets (RFSs) and variational
inference, deriving a highly tractable, approximate method for obtaining the
multi-Bernoulli distribution that minimises the set Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence from the true posterior, working within the RFS framework to
incorporate uncertainty in target existence. The derivation is interpreted as
an application of expectation-maximisation (EM), where the missing data is the
correspondence of Bernoulli components (i.e., tracks) under each data
association hypothesis. The missing data is shown to play an identical role to
the selection of an ordered distribution in the same ordered family in the set
JPDA algorithm. Subsequently, a special case of the proposed method is utilised
to provide an efficient approximation of the minimum mean optimal sub-pattern
assignment estimator. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated
in challenging scenarios in which up to twenty targets come into close
proximity."
"The ability to rapidly focus attention and react to salient environmental
features enables animals to move agiley through their habitats. To replicate
this kind of high-performance control of movement in synthetic systems, we
propose a new approach to feedback control that bases control actions on
randomly perceived features. Connections will be made with recent work
incorporating communication protocols into networked control systems. The
concepts of {\em random channel controllability} and {\em random channel
observability} for LTI control systems are introduced and studied."
"The objective of the research is to develop a general method of constructing
Lyapunov functions for non-linear non-autonomous differential inclusions
described by ordinary differential equations with parameters. The goal has been
attained through the following ideas and tools. First, three-point Poincare
strategy of the investigation of differential equations and manifolds has been
used. Second, the geometric-topological structure of the non-linear
non-autonomous parametric differential inclusions has been presented and
analyzed in the framework of hierarchical fiber bundles. Third, a special
canonizing transformation of the differential inclusions that allows to present
them in special canonical form, for which certain standard forms of Lyapunov
functions exist, has been found. The conditions establishing the relation
between the local asymptotical stability of two corresponding particular
integral curves of a given differential inclusion in its initial and canonical
forms are ascertained. The global asymptotical stability of the entire free
dynamical systems as some restrictions of a given parametric differential
inclusion and the whole latter one per se has been investigated in terms of the
classificational stability of the typical fiber of the meta-bundle. There have
discussed the prospects of development and modifications of the Lyapunov second
method in the light of the discovery of the new features of Lyapunov functions."
"A simple step and search control strategy for extracting maximum output power
from grid connected Variable Speed Wind Energy Conversion System (VSWECS) is
implemented in this work. This system consists of a variable speed wind turbine
coupled to a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) through a gear box,
a DC-DC boost converter and a hysteresis current controlled Voltage Source
Converter (VSC). The Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) extracts maximum power
from the wind turbine from cut-into rated wind velocity by sensing only by DC
link power. This system can be connected to a micro-grid. Also it can be used
for supplying an isolated local load by means of converting the output of
Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) to DC and then convert to AC by
means of hysteresis current controlled Voltage Source Converter (VSI)."
"In this paper we propose a method for applications oriented input design for
linear systems under time-domain constraints on the amplitude of input and
output signals. The method guarantees a desired control performance for the
estimated model in minimum time, by imposing some lower bound on the
information matrix. The problem is formulated as a time domain optimization
problem, which is non-convex. This is addressed through an alternating method,
where we separate the problem into two steps and at each step we optimize the
cost function with respect to one of two variables. We alternate between these
two steps until convergence. A time recursive input design algorithm is
performed, which enables us to use the algorithm with control. Therefore, a
receding horizon framework is used to solve each optimization problem. Finally,
we illustrate the method with two numerical examples which show the good
ability of the proposed approach in generating an optimal input signal."
"Elementary hybrid systems (EHSs) are those hybrid systems (HSs) containing
elementary functions such as exp, ln, sin, cos, etc. EHSs are very common in
practice, especially in safety-critical domains. Due to the non-polynomial
expressions which lead to undecidable arithmetic, verification of EHSs is very
hard. Existing approaches based on partition of state space or
over-approximation of reachable sets suffer from state explosion or inflation
of numerical errors. In this paper, we propose a symbolic abstraction approach
that reduces EHSs to polynomial hybrid systems (PHSs), by replacing all
non-polynomial terms with newly introduced variables. Thus the verification of
EHSs is reduced to the one of PHSs, enabling us to apply all the
well-established verification techniques and tools for PHSs to EHSs. In this
way, it is possible to avoid the limitations of many existing methods. We
illustrate the abstraction approach and its application in safety verification
of EHSs by several real world examples."
"The paper contains technical details of recent results developed by the
author, regarding the design of LPV controllers directly from experimental
data. Two numerical examples are also presented, about control of the Duffing
oscillator and control of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator."
"In our companion paper [1], an information identity decomposition has been
derived, which can be interpreted as a law of conservation of information flows
in feedback systems. In this paper, we further investigate this decomposition
result when specified to linear time-invariant(LTI) systems connected with
additive white Gaussian noise(AWGN) channels. It is shown that the quantities
in the decomposition are characterized in sensitivity function and the law of
conservation is verified."
"A solution to the stability of capacitor-less low-dropout regulators with a
4pF Miller capacitor in Multi-level current amplifier is proposed. With the
Miller compensation, a more than 50{\deg}phase margin is guaranteed in full
load. An extra fast transient circuit is adopted to reduce stable time and peak
voltage. When the load changes from light to heavy, the peak voltage is 40mV
and chip quiescent current is only 45uA."
"The quasi steady-state (QSS) model tries to reach a good compromise between
accuracy and efficiency in long-term stability analysis. However, the QSS model
is unable to provide correct approximations and stability assessment for the
long-term stability model consistently. In this paper, some numerical examples
in which the QSS model was stable while the long-term stability model underwent
instabilities are presented with analysis in nonlinear system framework. At the
same time, a hybrid model which serves as a remedy to the QSS model is proposed
according to causes for failure of the QSS model and dynamic mechanisms of
long-term instabilities. Numerical examples are given to show that the
developed hybrid model can successfully capture unstable behaviors of the
long-term stability model while the QSS model fails."
"Automated synthesis of reactive control protocols from temporal logic
specifications has recently attracted considerable attention in various
applications in, for example, robotic motion planning, network management, and
hardware design. An implicit and often unrealistic assumption in this past work
is the availability of complete and precise sensing information during the
execution of the controllers. In this paper, we use an abstraction procedure
for systems with partial observation and propose a formalism to investigate
effects of limitations in sensing. The abstraction procedure enables the
existing synthesis methods with partial observation to be applicable and
efficient for systems with infinite (or finite but large number of) states.
This formalism enables us to systematically discover sensing modalities
necessary in order to render the underlying synthesis problems feasible. We use
counterexamples, which witness unrealizability potentially due to the
limitations in sensing and the coarseness in the abstract system, and
interpolation-based techniques to refine the model and the sensing modalities,
i.e., to identify new sensors to be included, in such synthesis problems. We
demonstrate the method on examples from robotic motion planning."
"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have the promise of presenting the next
evolution in computing with potential applications that include aerospace,
transportation, robotics, and various automation systems. These applications
motivate advances in the different sub-fields of CPS (e.g. mobile computing and
communication, control, and vision). However, deploying and testing complete
CPSs is known to be a complex and expensive task. In this paper, we present the
design, implementation, and evaluation of Up and Away (UnA): a testbed for
Cyber-Physical Systems that use UAVs as their physical component. UnA aims at
abstracting the control of physical components of the system to reduce the
complexity of UAV oriented Cyber-Physical Systems experiments. In addition, UnA
provides an API to allow for converting CPS simulations into physical
experiments using a few simple steps. We present a case study bringing a
mobile-camera-based surveillance system simulation to life using UnA."
"The paper considers a distributed robust estimation problem over a network
with directed topology involving continuous time observers. While measurements
are available to the observers continuously, the nodes interact according to a
Round-Robin rule, at discrete time instances. The results of the paper are
sufficient conditions which guarantee a suboptimal $H_\infty$ level of
consensus between observers with sampled interconnections."
"This paper presents a modified multi model predictive control algorithm for
the control of riser outlet temperature and regenerator temperature for the
fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU). The models of the fluid catalytic
cracking unit are estimated using subspace identification (N4SID) algorithm.
The PRBS signal is applied as an input signal to estimate the FCCU models.
Since the estimated model does not give 100% fit; especially for nonlinear
systems having more than one operating conditions, multi-model approach is
proposed. In multi model, more than one model of FCCU used in MPC design. The
main advantages of proposed method are that it can handle hard input and output
constraints and it can be used for multi input multi output processes (MIMO)
without increasing the complexity in control design. MATLAB/Simulink is used to
estimate the models of FCCU and simulate the results for the controller. The
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides better result for
both reference tracking and disturbance rejection."
"This project presents decentralized control scheme for Load-Frequency Control
in power System. In this era renewable energy is most promising solution to
man's ever increasing energy needs. But the power production by these resources
cannot be controlled unlike in thermal plants. A number of optimal control
techniques are adopted to implement a reliable stabilizing controller. It is
necessary to interconnect more distributed generation in power systems because
of environmental concerns. Primary concern includes global environmental and
energy depletion problem. A serious attempt has been undertaken aiming a
investigating the load frequency control problem in a power system consisting
of two power generation unit and multiple variable load units. The robustness
and reliability of the various control schemes is examined through simulations.
A system involving thermal plants and a hydro plant is modeled using MAT LAB
2011b."
"In many signal processing applications it is required to estimate the
unobservable state of a dynamic system from its noisy measurements. For linear
dynamic systems with Gaussian Mixture (GM) noise distributions, Gaussian Sum
Filters (GSF) provide the MMSE state estimate by tracking the GM posterior.
However, since the number of the clusters of the GM posterior grows
exponentially over time, suitable reduction schemes need to be used to maintain
the size of the bank in GSF. In this work we propose a low computational
complexity reduction scheme which uses an initial state estimation to find the
active noise clusters and removes all the others. Since the performance of our
proposed method relies on the accuracy of the initial state estimation, we also
propose five methods for finding this estimation. We provide simulation results
showing that with suitable choice of the initial state estimation (based on the
shape of the noise models), our proposed reduction scheme provides better state
estimations both in terms of accuracy and precision when compared with other
reduction methods."
"In this paper, containment control of multi-agent systems with measurement
noises is studied under directed networks. When the leaders are stationary, a
stochastic approximation type protocol is employed to solve the containment
control of multi-agent systems. By using stochastic analysis tools and
algebraic graph theory, some necessary and sufficient criteria are established
to ensure the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders in
the sense of mean square and probability 1. When the leasers are dynamic, a
stochastic approximation type protocol with distributed estimators is developed
and necessary and sufficient conditions are also obtained for solving the
containment control problem. Simulations are provided to illustrate the
effectiveness of the theoretical results."
"Collocated adaptive control of underactuated systems is still a main concern
for the control community, all the more so because the collocated dynamics is
no longer linear with respect to the constant base parameters. This work
extends and encompasses the well known adaptive control result for fully
actuated mechanical systems to the underactuated case. The key point is the
introduction of a fictitious control input that allows us to consider the
complete system dynamics, which is assumed to be linear with respect to the
base parameters. Local stability and convergence of time varying reference
trajectories for the collocated dynamics are demonstrated by using Lyapunov and
Barbalat arguments. Simulation and experimental results on a two-link
manipulator verify the soundness of the proposed approach."
"Due to the requirements of high positioning accuracy, small swing angle,
short transportation time, and high safety, both motion and stabilization
control for an gantry crane system becomes an interesting issue in the field of
control technology development. In this paper, dynamic model of gantry crane is
extracted using Lagrange method. This model has been linearized and weaknesses
of state feedback control of this model is reviewed. To solve these problems,
state feedback gain matrix is calculated using LQR method and results are fully
investigated. Finally, a full nonlinear solution of problem using feedback
linearization method is implemented and results are compared with previous
works."
"We study a stabilization problem of linear uncertain systems with parametric
uncertainties via feedback control over data-rate-constrained channels. The
objective is to find the limitation on the amount of information that must be
conveyed through the channels for achieving stabilization and in particular how
the plant uncertainties affect it. We derive a necessary condition and a
sufficient condition for stabilizing the closed-loop system. These conditions
provide limitations in the form of bounds on data rate and magnitude of
uncertainty on plant parameters. The bounds are characterized by the product of
the poles of the nominal plant and are less conservative than those known in
the literature. In the course of deriving these results, a new class of
nonuniform quantizers is found to be effective in reducing the required data
rate. For scalar plants, these quantizers are shown to minimize the required
data rate, and the obtained conditions become tight."
"In this article a model predictive control (MPC) based frequency control
scheme for energy storage units was derived, focusing on the incorporation of
stability constraints based on Lyapunov theory and the concept of passivity.
The proposed control schemes, guaranteeing closed-loop stability, are applied
on a one-area and two-area power system. For the two-area power system, a
coordinated (centralized) control and an uncoordinated (decentralized) control
approach is conducted. The stability properties of the different MPC setups
were derived, implemented and simulated. Furthermore the corresponding control
performance was analyzed."
"In this paper, different electric motors are studied and compared to see the
benefits of each motor and the one that is more suitable to be used in the
electric vehicle applications. There are five main electric motor types, DC,
induction, permanent magnet synchronous, switched reluctance and brush-less DC
motors are studied."
"In this paper, a simulation-based method for the analysis and design of
abstracted models for a stochastic hybrid system is proposed. The accuracy of a
model is evaluated in terms of its capability to reproduce the system output
for all the realizations of the stochastic input except for a set of (small)
probability epsilon (epsilon-abstraction). This naturally leads to
chance-constrained optimization problems, which are here tackled by means of a
recently developed randomized approach. The main thrust of this paper is that,
by testing how close the model and system outputs are over a finite number N of
input realizations only, conclusions can be drawn about the model capability as
an epsilon-abstraction. The key feature of the proposed method is its high
versatility since it does not require specific assumptions on the system to be
approximated. The only requirement is that of being able to run multiple
simulations of the system behavior for different input realizations."
"Estimating consistent parameters of a structured state-space representation
requires a reliable initialization when the vector of parameters is computed by
using a gradient-based algorithm. In the eponymous companion paper accepted for
publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, the problem of supplying
a reliable initial vector of parameters is tackled. More precisely, by assuming
that a reliable initial fully-parameterized state-space model of the system is
available, the aforementioned paper addresses the challenging problem of
transforming this initial fully-parameterized model into the structured
state-space parameterization satisfied by the system to be identified. Two
solutions to solve such a parameterization problem are more precisely
introduced in the IEEE TAC paper. First, a solution based on a null-space-based
reformulation of a set of equations arising from the aforementioned similarity
transformation problem is considered. Second, an algorithm dedicated to
non-convex optimization is presented in order to transform the initial
fully-parameterized model into the structured state-space parameterization of
the system to be identified. In this technical report, a specific attention is
paid to the gradient computation required by the optimization algorithms used
in aforementioned to solve the aforementioned problem. These gradient
formulations are indeed necessary to apply the quasi-Newton
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) methods used for the null-space based
as well as the least-squares-formulated optimization techniques introduced in
the IEEE TAC paper. For the sake of conciseness, we only focus on the smooth
version of the optimization problem introduced in aforementioned paper.
Interested readers can easily extend the following results by using the chain
rule as well as the sub-gradient computation techniques."
"In this paper an adaptive control systems scheme is used to update the rotor
resistance of an induction motor drive. Rotor resistance of the induction motor
drive is dependent on the temperature where it is installed for one Induced
Draft Fan (I.D Fan) in one of the 500 MW generating thermal power plant. The
rotor resistance adaptation is of induction motor drive is achieved through
Indirect Field Oriented. The desired value of the rotor flux along the q - axis
should ideally be zero. This condition acts as a reference model for the
proposed Adaptive Control scheme. Inductance does not change with the
temperature. Therefore, the only parameter which changes with the temperature
in the adjustable model is the rotor resistance. This resistance is adjusted
such that the flux along the q - axis is driven to zero. The proposed method
effectively adjusts the rotor resistance on-line and keeps the machine field
oriented. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested through simulation
and is experimentally verified."
"This paper introduces a novel closed-form strategy that dynamically modifies
the reference of a pre-compensated nonlinear system to ensure the satisfaction
of a set of convex constraints. The main idea consists of translating
constraints in the state space into constraints on the Lyapunov function and
then modulating the reference velocity so as to limit the value of the Lyapunov
function. The theory is introduced for general nonlinear systems subject to
convex constraints. In the case of polyhedric constraints, an explicit solution
is provided for the large and highly relevant class of nonlinear systems whose
Lyapunov function is lower-bounded by a quadratic form. In view of improving
performances, further specializations are provided for the relevant cases of
linear systems and robotic manipulators."
"This chapter reviews four notions of system structure, three of which are
contextual and classic (i.e. the complete computational structure linked to a
state space model, the sparsity pattern of a transfer function, and the
interconnection of subsystems) and one which is relatively new (i.e. the signal
structure of a system's dynamical structure function). Although each of these
structural concepts apply to the nonlinear and stochastic setting, this work
will focus on linear time invariant systems to distill the key concepts and
make their relationships clear. We then discusses three applications of the
newest structural form (the signal structure of a system's dynamical structure
function): network reconstruction, vulnerability analysis, and a recent result
in distributed control that guarantees the synthesis of a stabilizing
controller with a specified structure or proves that no such controller exists."
"This paper presents a model for tracking of extended targets, where each
target is represented by a given number of elliptic subobjects. A gamma
Gaussian inverse Wishart implementation is derived, and necessary
approximations are suggested to alleviate the data association complexity. A
simulation study shows the merits of the model compared to previous work on the
topic."
"The paper carries out a review of the main functional aspects of an
electro-energetic system, principles which lead to an evolution or even to a
paradigm change the the control of such complex systems. The repositioning of
the physical and information systems, mainly through the development of the
computing and communication distributed entities, lead to a new structuring of
the control approach in power systems, in accordance to the modern
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) paradigm."
"Consider the problem of control selection in complex dynamical and
environmental scenarios where model predictive control (MPC) proves
particularly effective. As the performance of MPC is highly dependent on the
efficiency of its incorporated search algorithm, this work examined hill
climbing as an alternative to traditional systematic or random search
algorithms. The relative performance of a candidate hill climbing algorithm was
compared to representative systematic and random algorithms in a set of
systematic tests and in a real-world control scenario. These tests indicated
that hill climbing can provide significantly improved search efficiency when
the control space has a large number of dimensions or divisions along each
dimension. Furthermore, this demonstrated that there was little increase in
search times associated with a significant increase in the number of control
configurations considered."
"The problem of modeling and control of multi-terminal high-voltage
direct-current transmission systems is addressed in this paper, which contains
five main contributions. First, to propose a unified, physically motivated,
modeling framework - based on port-Hamiltonian representations - of the various
network topologies used in this application. Second, to prove that the system
can be globally asymptotically stabilized with a decentralized PI control, that
exploits its passivity properties. Close connections between the proposed PI
and the popular Akagi's PQ instantaneous power method are also established.
Third, to reveal the transient performance limitations of the proposed
controller that, interestingly, is shown to be intrinsic to PI passivity-based
control. Fourth, motivated by the latter, an outer-loop that overcomes the
aforementioned limitations is proposed. The performance limitation of the PI,
and its drastic improvement using outer-loop controls, are verified via
simulations on a three-terminals benchmark example. A final contribution is a
novel formulation of the power flow equations for the centralized references
calculation."
"The paper considers a problem of consensus-based synchronization of uncertain
parameter varying multi-agent systems. We present a method for constructing
consensus-based synchronization protocol schedules for each agent to ensure it
synchronizes with a reference parameter-varying system. The proposed protocol
guarantees a specified level of $H_\infty$ transient consensus between the
agents. The algorithm uses a consensus-preserving interpolation and produces
continuous (in the scheduling parameter) coefficients for the protocol. An
application to synchronization of uncertain bilinear systems is discussed."
"In this paper, the benefits of distributed energy resources (DERs) are
considered in an energy management scheme for a smart community consisting of a
large number of residential units (RUs) and a shared facility controller (SFC).
A non-cooperative Stackelberg game between RUs and the SFC is proposed in order
to explore how both entities can benefit, in terms of achieved utility and
minimizing total cost respectively, from their energy trading with each other
and the grid. From the properties of the game, it is shown that the maximum
benefit to the SFC in terms of reduction in total cost is obtained at the
unique and strategy proof Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). It is further shown
that the SE is guaranteed to be reached by the SFC and RUs by executing the
proposed algorithm in a distributed fashion, where participating RUs comply
with their best strategies in response to the action chosen by the SFC. In
addition, a charging-discharging scheme is introduced for the SFC's storage
device (SD) that can further lower the SFC's total cost if the proposed game is
implemented. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme."
"Converting the traction power of kites into electricity can be a low cost
solution for wind energy. Reliable control of both trajectory and tether
reeling is crucial. The present study proposes a modelling framework describing
the dynamic behaviour of the interconnected system components, suitable for
design and optimization of the control systems. The wing, bridle, airborne
control unit and tether are represented as a particle system using
spring-damper elements to describe their mechanical properties. Two kite models
are proposed: a point mass model and a four point model. Reeling of the tether
is modelled by varying the lengths of constituent tether elements. Dynamic
behaviour of the ground station is included. The framework is validated by
combining it with the automatic control system used for the operation of a kite
power system demonstrator. The simulation results show that the point mass
model can be adjusted to match the measured behaviour during a pumping cycle.
The four point model can better predict the influence of gravity and inertia on
the steering response and remains stable also at low tether forces. Compared to
simple one point models, the proposed framework is more accurate and robust
while allowing real-time simulations of the complete system."
"In this paper, a complete industrial validation of a recently published
scheme for on-line adaptation of the control updating period in Model
Predictive Control is proposed. The industrial process that serves in the
validation is a cryogenic refrigerator that is used to cool the
supra-conductors involved in particle accelerators or experimental nuclear
reactors. Two recently predicted features are validated: the first states that
it is sometimes better to use less efficient (per iteration) optimizer if the
lack of efficiency is over-compensated by an increase in the updating control
frequency. The second is that for a given solver, it is worth monitoring the
control updating period based on the on-line measured behavior of the cost
function."
"In this paper we solve the problem of finding a trajectory that shows that a
given hybrid dynamical system with deterministic evolution leaves a given set
of states considered to be safe. The algorithm combines local with global
search for achieving both efficiency and global convergence. In local search,
it exploits derivatives for efficient computation. Unlike other methods for
falsification of hybrid systems with deterministic evolution, we do not
restrict our search to trajectories of a certain bounded length but search for
error trajectories of arbitrary length."
"There are several results on the stability of nonlinear positive systems in
the presence of time delays. However, most of them assume that the delays are
constant. This paper considers time-varying, possibly unbounded, delays and
establishes asymptotic stability and bounds the decay rate of a significant
class of nonlinear positive systems which includes positive linear systems as a
special case. Specifically, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for
delay-independent stability of continuous-time positive systems whose vector
fields are cooperative and homogeneous. We show that global asymptotic
stability of such systems is independent of the magnitude and variation of the
time delays. For various classes of time delays, we are able to derive explicit
expressions that quantify the decay rates of positive systems. We also provide
the corresponding counterparts for discrete-time positive systems whose vector
fields are non-decreasing and homogeneous."
"In this article, we consider a receding horizon control of discrete-time
state-dependent jump linear systems, particular kind of stochastic switching
systems, subject to possibly unbounded random disturbances and probabilistic
state constraints. Due to a nature of the dynamical system and the constraints,
we consider a one-step receding horizon. Using inverse cumulative distribution
function, we convert the probabilistic state constraints to deterministic
constraints, and obtain a tractable deterministic receding horizon control
problem. We consider the receding control law to have a linear state-feedback
and an admissible offset term. We ensure mean square boundedness of the state
variable via solving linear matrix inequalities off-line, and solve the
receding horizon control problem on-line with control offset terms. We
illustrate the overall approach applied on a macroeconomic system."
"This paper deals a continuous-time state-dependent jump linear system, a
particular kind of stochastic switching system. In particular, we consider a
situation when the transition rate of the random jump process depends on the
state variable, and addressed the problem of stochastic stability and
stabilization analysis for the proposed system. Numerically solvable sufficient
conditions for the stochastic stability and stabilization of the proposed
system is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The obtained
results are illustrated in numerical examples."
"Power systems are usually large non-linear systems, which are often subjected
to low frequency electromechanical oscillations. Power System Stabilizers are
often used as effective and economic means for damping the generator's
electromechanical oscillations and enhance the overall stability of power
systems. Power system stabilizers have been applied for several decades in
utilities and they can extend power transfer stability limits by adding
modulation signal through excitation control system. Sliding mode control is
one of the main methods employed to overcome the uncertainty of the system.
This controller can be applied very well in presence of both parameter
uncertainties and unknown nonlinear function such as disturbance. To enhance
stability and improve dynamic response of the system operating in faulty
conditions a Fuzzy based Sliding Mode Control Power System Stabiliser is
developed for a multimachine system with two generators and it is compared with
the Conventional Power System Stabiliser, Fuzzy based Power System Stabiliser,
Sliding Mode based Power System Stabiliser."
"Linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) sensors are used in
engineering applications due to their fine-grained measurements. However, these
sensors exhibit non-linear input-output characteristics, which decrease the
reliability of the sensing system. The contribution of this article is
three-fold. First, it provides an experimental study of the non-linearity
problem of the LVDT. Second, it proposes the design of a functional link
artificial neural network (FLANN) based non-linearity compensator model for
overcoming it. Finally, it validates the feasibility of the solution in
simulation, and presents a proof-of-concept hardware implementation on a
SPARTAN-II (PQ208)FPGA using VHDL in Xilinx. The model has been mathematically
derived, and its simulation study has been presented that achieves nearly 100%
linearity range. The result obtained from the FPGA implementation is in good
agreement with the simulation result, which establishes its actualization as
part of a general manufacturing process for linearity compensated LVDT sensors."
"Mobile phone 1800MHz band already allowed to be used in some airlines. Many
studies talked about lower the mobile phone output power to the lowest of 0dBm,
but seldom talk about the Random Access Channel RACH, which will emit at the
highest power of 30dBm at the instant of call making and is not controllable
until the connection between the Base Station and mobile is made.Hence the
impact of RACH and TDMA noise generated in the aircraft."
"A novel control design approach for general nonlinear systems is presented in
this paper. The approach is based on the identification of a polynomial model
of the system to control and on the on-line inversion of this model. An
efficient technique is developed to perform the inversion, which allows an
effective control implementation on real-time processors."
"We propose a distributed algorithm for controlling traffic signals, allowing
constraints such as periodic switching sequences of phases and minimum and
maximum green time to be incorporated. Our algorithm is adapted from
backpressure routing, which has been mainly applied to communication and power
networks. We formally prove that our algorithm ensures global optimality as it
leads to maximum network throughput even though the controller is constructed
and implemented in a completely distributed manner."
"We show that a sub-homogeneous positive monotone system with bounded
heterogeneous time-varying delays is globally asymptotically stable if and only
if the corresponding delay-free system is globally asymptotically stable. The
proof is based on an extension of a delay-independent stability result for
monotone systems under constant delays by Smith to systems with bounded
heterogeneous time-varying delays. Under the additional assumption of
positivity and sub-homogeneous vector fields, we establish the aforementioned
delay insensitivity property and derive a novel test for global asymptotic
stability. If the system has a unique equilibrium point in the positive
orthant, we prove that our stability test is necessary and sufficient.
Specialized to positive linear systems, our results extend and sharpen existing
results from the literature."
"This article introduces the idea of decomposition of interval Type-2 fuzzy
logic system into two parallel type-1 fuzzy systems. This decomposition avoids
the problems associated with type-reduction techniques normally needed in
type-2 fuzzy systems. Next, we compare the performance of a decomposed type-2
controller to the performance of a type-1 controller in stabilizing an inverted
pendulum."
"Stochastic unit commitment models typically handle uncertainties in forecast
demand by considering a finite number of realizations from a stochastic process
model for loads. Accurate evaluations of expectations or higher moments for the
quantities of interest require a prohibitively large number of model
evaluations. In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on using
surrogate models valid over the range of the forecast uncertainty. We consider
surrogate models based on Polynomial Chaos expansions, constructed using sparse
quadrature methods. Considering expected generation cost, we demonstrate the
approach can lead to several orders of magnitude reduction in computational
cost relative to using Monte Carlo sampling on the original model, for a given
target error threshold."
"In this paper consensus in second-order multi-agent systems with a
non-periodic sampled-data exchange among agents is investigated. The sampling
is random with bounded inter-sampling intervals. It is assumed that each agent
has exact knowledge of its own state at all times. The considered local
interaction rule is PD-type. The characterization of the convergence properties
exploits a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient conditions for
stability of the consensus protocol to a time-invariant value are derived.
Numerical simulations are presented to corroborate the theoretical results."
"In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of switched multi-agent
system composed of continuous-time and discrete-time subsystems. By combining
the classical consensus protocols of continuous-time and discrete-time
multi-agent systems, we propose a linear consensus protocol for switched
multi-agent system. Based on the graph theory and Lyapunov theory, we prove
that the consensus of switched multi-agent system is solvable under arbitrary
switching with undirected connected graph, directed graph and switching
topologies, respectively. Simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the theoretical results."
"We propose a dynamical model for cascading failures in single-commodity
network flows. In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows and
activation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly
state-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity
on the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network
state, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed
dynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition
on itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between
link activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive
successively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern
of cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard
cascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of
cumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the
margin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the
magnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node
become inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the
margin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access
to information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when
the routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we
identify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper
bound is tight under an appropriate routing policy. Our analysis relies on
making connections between network parameters and monotonicity in network state
evolution under proposed dynamics."
"The aim of this paper is to propose diffusion strategies for distributed
estimation over adaptive networks, assuming the presence of spatially
correlated measurements distributed according to a Gaussian Markov random field
(GMRF) model. The proposed methods incorporate prior information about the
statistical dependency among observations, while at the same time processing
data in real-time and in a fully decentralized manner. A detailed mean-square
analysis is carried out in order to prove stability and evaluate the
steady-state performance of the proposed strategies. Finally, we also
illustrate how the proposed techniques can be easily extended in order to
incorporate thresholding operators for sparsity recovery applications.
Numerical results show the potential advantages of using such techniques for
distributed learning in adaptive networks deployed over GMRF."
"This paper investigates the feasibility of using a discriminate pricing
scheme to offset the inconvenience that is experienced by an energy user (EU)
in trading its energy with an energy controller in smart grid. The main
objective is to encourage EUs with small distributed energy resources (DERs),
or with high sensitivity to their inconvenience, to take part in the energy
trading via providing incentive to them with relatively higher payment at the
same time as reducing the total cost to the energy controller. The proposed
scheme is modeled through a two-stage Stackelberg game that describes the
energy trading between a shared facility authority (SFA) and EUs in a smart
community. A suitable cost function is proposed for the SFA to leverage the
generation of discriminate pricing according to the inconvenience experienced
by each EU. It is shown that the game has a unique sub-game perfect equilibrium
(SPE), under the certain condition at which the SFA's total cost is minimized,
and that each EU receives its best utility according to its associated
inconvenience for the given price. A backward induction technique is used to
derive a closed form expression for the price function at SPE, and thus the
dependency of price on an EU's different decision parameters is explained for
the studied system. Numerical examples are provided to show the beneficial
properties of the proposed scheme."
"In this paper, a nonlinear extension of the Georgiou-Smith system is
considered and robustness results are proved for a class of nonlinear PI
controllers with respect to fast parasitic first-order dynamics. More
specifically, for a perturbed nonlinear system with sector bounded nonlinearity
and unknown control direction, sufficient conditions for global boundedness and
attractivity have been derived. It is shown that the closed loop system is
globally bounded and attractive if (i) the unmodelled dynamics are sufficiently
fast and (ii) the PI control gain has the Nussbaum function property. For the
case of nominally unstable systems, the Nussbaum property of the control gain
appears to be crucial. A simulation study confirms the theoretical results."
"In this paper, we provide a Dynamic Programming algorithm for on-line
monitoring of the state robustness of Metric Temporal Logic specifications with
past time operators. We compute the robustness of MTL with unbounded past and
bounded future temporal operators MTL over sampled traces of Cyber-Physical
Systems. We implemented our tool in Matlab as a Simulink block that can be used
in any Simulink model. We experimentally demonstrate that the overhead of the
MTL robustness monitoring is acceptable for certain classes of practical
specifications."
"This paper introduces a conception that any weighted directed network
topology is almost decouplable, which can help to transform the topology into a
similar form being composed of uncoupled vertices, and thus reduce the
complexity of analysis for networked dynamical systems. As an example of its
application, the consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems with
time-varying network topologies is addressed. As a result, a necessary and
sufficient condition for uniform consensus is proposed."
"In this paper we develop an algorithm for peak load reduction to reduce the
impact of increased air conditioner usage in a residential smart grid
community. We develop Demand Response Management (DRM) plans that clearly spell
out the maximum duration as well as maximum severity of inconvenience. We model
the air conditioner as a power throttling device and for any given DRM plan we
study the impact of increasing the number of power states on the resulting peak
load reduction. Through simulations, we find out that adding just one
additional state to the basic ON/OFF model, which can throttle power to 50% of
the rated air conditioner power, can result in significant amount of peak
reduction. However, the peak load that can be reduced is diminishing with the
increase in number of states. Furthermore, we also observe the impact of
inconvenience duration and inconvenience severity in terms of peak load
reduction. These observations can serve as useful guidelines for developing
appropriate DRM plans."
"The smart grid spawns many innovative ideas, but many of them cannot be
easily integrated into the existing power system due to power system
constraints, such as the lack of capacity to transport renewable energy in
remote areas to the urban centers. An energy delivery system can be built upon
the traffic network and electric vehicles (EVs) utilized as energy carriers to
transport energy over a large geographical region. A generalized architecture
called the vehicular energy network (VEN) is constructed and a mathematically
tractable framework is developed. Dynamic wireless (dis)charging allows
electric energy, as an energy packet, to be added and subtracted from EV
batteries seamlessly. With proper routing, energy can be transported from the
sources to destinations through EVs along appropriate vehicular routes. This
paper gives a preliminary study of VEN. Models are developed to study its
operational and economic feasibilities with real traffic data in the United
Kingdom. Our study shows that a substantial amount of renewable energy can be
transported from some remote wind farms to London under some reasonable
settings and VEN is likely to be profitable in the near future. VEN can
complement the power network and enhance its power delivery capability."
"Increased distributed Photo-Voltaic (PV) generation leads to an increase in
voltages and unwarranted backflows into the grid. This paper investigates
Demand Response (DR) with Electric Water Heaters (EWHs) as a way to increase
the PV hosting capacity of a low-voltage feeder. A control strategy relying
only on power measurements at the transformer is proposed. Flexible loads are
optimally dispatched considering energy acquisition costs, a PV shedding
penalty, and power and energy constraints. Furthermore, grouping of loads and
PV plants is investigated, and switching penalties are used to reduce the
unnecessary switching of loads. It is shown that this strategy can
substantially increase the PV hosting capacity of a Low-Voltage (LV) feeder,
even when only basic controllability is available."
"A controller design technique for shaping the frequency response of a process
is described. A general linear model (GLM) is used to define the form of a lag
or lead compensator in discrete time using a prescribed set of basis functions.
The model is then transformed via the complex z-domain into a difference
equation for a recursive digital filter with an infinite impulse response
(IIR). A polynomial basis set is better for shaping the frequency response in
the near-zero region; whereas a sinusoidal basis set is better for defining the
response at arbitrary frequencies. The proposed compensator design method is
more flexible than existing low-order approaches and more suitable than other
general-purpose high-order methods. Performance of the resulting controller is
compared with digital proportional-integral-differential (PID) and
linear-state-space (LSS) algorithms in a real motor-control application."
"Techniques for the evaluation of complex polynomials with one and two
variables are introduced. Polynomials arise in may areas such as control
systems, image and signal processing, coding theory, electrical networks, etc.,
and their evaluations are time consuming. This paper introduces new evaluation
algorithms that are straightforward with fewer arithmetic operations."
"We introduce a distributed, cooperative framework and method for Bayesian
estimation and control in decentralized agent networks. Our framework combines
joint estimation of time-varying global and local states with
information-seeking control optimizing the behavior of the agents. It is suited
to nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems and, in particular, to location-aware
networks. For cooperative estimation, a combination of belief propagation
message passing and consensus is used. For cooperative control, the negative
posterior joint entropy of all states is maximized via a gradient ascent. The
estimation layer provides the control layer with probabilistic information in
the form of sample representations of probability distributions. Simulation
results demonstrate intelligent behavior of the agents and excellent estimation
performance for a simultaneous self-localization and target tracking problem.
In a cooperative localization scenario with only one anchor, mobile agents can
localize themselves after a short time with an accuracy that is higher than the
accuracy of the performed distance measurements."
"In this paper, block-oriented systems with linear parts based on Laguerre
functions is used to approximation of a cone crusher dynamics. Adaptive
recursive least squares algorithm is used to identification of Laguerre model.
Various structures of Hammerstein, Wiener, Hammerstein-Wiener models are tested
and the MATLAB simulation results are compared. The mean square error is used
for models validation. It has been found that Hammerstein-Wiener with
orthonormal basis functions improves the quality of approximation plant
dynamics. The mean square error for this model is 11% on average throughout the
considered range of the external disturbances amplitude. The analysis also
showed that Wiener model cannot provide sufficient approximation accuracy of
the cone crusher dynamics. During the process it is unstable due to the high
sensitivity to disturbances on the output. The Hammerstein-Wiener model will be
used to the design nonlinear model predictive control application."
"This paper considers the problem of state tracking with observation control
for a particular class of dynamical systems. The system state evolution is
described by a discrete-time, finite-state Markov chain, while the measurement
process is characterized by a controlled multi-variate Gaussian observation
model. The computational complexity of the optimal control strategy proposed in
our prior work proves to be prohibitive. A suboptimal, lower complexity
algorithm based on the Fisher information measure is proposed. Toward this end,
the preceding measure is generalized to account for multi-valued discrete
parameters and control inputs. A closed-form formula for our system model is
also derived. Numerical simulations are provided for a physical activity
tracking application showing the near-optimal performance of the proposed
algorithm."
"In this paper we use optimization-based methods to design output-feedback
controllers for a class of one-dimensional parabolic partial differential
equations. The output may be distributed or point-measurements. The input may
be distributed or boundary actuation. We use Lyapunov operators, duality, and
the Luenberger observer framework to reformulate the synthesis problem as a
convex optimization problem expressed as a set of Linear-Operator-Inequalities
(LOIs). We then show how feasibility of these LOIs may be tested using
Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and the Sum-of-Squares methodology."
"Controllers are often designed based on a reduced or simplified model of the
plant dynamics. In this context, we investigate whether it is possible to
synthesize a stabilizing event-triggered feedback law for networked control
systems (NCS) which have two time-scales, based only on an approximate model of
the slow dynamics. We follow an emulation-like approach as we assume that we
know how to solve the problem in the absence of sampling and then we study how
to design the event-triggering rule under communication constraints. The NCS is
modeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to
generate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the
sampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the
stability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two
transmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time
for the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in
practice. The objective of this contribution is twofold. We first show that
existing event-triggering conditions can be adapted to singularly perturbed
systems and semiglobal practical stability can be ensured in this case. Second,
we propose another technique that combines event-triggered and time-triggered
results in the sense that transmissions are only allowed after a predefined
amount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This technique has the
advantage, under an additional assumption, to ensure a global asymptotic
stability property and to allow the user to directly tune the minimum
inter-transmission interval. We believe that this technique is of its own
interest independently of the two-time scale nature of the addressed problem.
The results are shown to be applicable to a class of globally Lipschitz
systems."
"The objective is to design output feedback event-triggered controllers to
stabilize a class of nonlinear systems. One of the main difficulties of the
problem is to ensure the existence of a minimum amount of time between two
consecutive transmissions, which is essential in practice. We solve this issue
by combining techniques from event-triggered and time-triggered control. The
idea is to turn on the event-triggering mechanism only after a fixed amount of
time has elapsed since the last transmission. This time is computed based on
results on the stabilization of time-driven sampled-data systems. The overall
strategy ensures an asymptotic stability property for the closed-loop system.
The results are proved to be applicable to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems
as a particular case."
"As the proportion of total power supplied by renewable sources increases, it
gets more costly to use reserve generation to compensate for the variability of
renewables like solar and wind. Hence attention has been drawn to exploiting
flexibility in demand as a substitute for reserve generation. Flexibility has
different attributes. In this paper we consider loads requiring a constant
power for a specified duration (within say one day), whose flexibility resides
in the fact that power may be delivered at any time so long as the total
duration of service equals the load's specified duration. We give conditions
under which a variable power supply is adequate to meet these flexible loads,
and describe how to allocate the power to the loads. We also characterize the
additional power needed when the supply is inadequate. We study the problem of
allocating the available power to loads to maximize welfare, and show that the
welfare optimum can be sustained as a competitive equilibrium in a forward
market in which electricity is sold as service contracts differentiated by the
duration of service and power level. We compare this forward market with a spot
market in their ability to capture the flexiblity inherent in
duration-differentiated loads."
"We present a procedure to simultaneously design the output feedback law and
the event-triggering condition to stabilize linear systems. The closed-loop
system is shown to satisfy a global asymptotic stability property and the
existence of a strictly positive minimum amount of time between two
transmissions is guaranteed. The event-triggered controller is obtained by
solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We then exploit the flexibility of
the method to maximize the guaranteed minimum amount of time between two
transmissions. Finally, we provide a (heuristic) method to reduce the amount of
transmissions, which is supported by numerical simulations."
"A fundamental problem that the bearing rigidity theory studies is to
determine when a framework can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a
scaling factor by its inter-neighbor bearings. While many previous works
focused on the bearing rigidity of two-dimensional frameworks, a first
contribution of this paper is to extend these results to arbitrary dimensions.
It is shown that a framework in an arbitrary dimension can be uniquely
determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by the bearings if and only
if the framework is infinitesimally bearing rigid. In this paper, the proposed
bearing rigidity theory is further applied to the bearing-only formation
stabilization problem where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor
bearings and the feedback control uses only bearing measurements. Nonlinear
distributed bearing-only formation control laws are proposed for the cases with
and without a global orientation. It is proved that the control laws can almost
globally stabilize infinitesimally bearing rigid formations. Numerical
simulations are provided to support the analysis."
"Non intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the
process of separating the total electricity consumption of a building as
measured at single point into the building's constituent loads. Previous
research in the field has mostly focused on residential buildings, and although
the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have
been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has
been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the
heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing
buildings as diverse as airports, malls and coffee shops), and hence the loads
within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy
disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights
for NILM in the commercial domain using data collected from a large smart meter
deployment within an educational campus in Delhi, India, of which a subset of
the data has been released for public use. We present an empirical
characterisation of loads in commercial buildings, highlighting the differences
in energy consumption and load characteristics between residential and
commercial buildings. We assess the validity of the assumptions generally made
by NILM solutions for residential buildings when applied to measurements from
commercial facilities. Based on our observations, we discuss the required
traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark
residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To
advance the research in commercial buildings energy disaggregation, we release
a subset of our data set, called COMBED (commercial building energy data set)."
"In this paper we propose an output-feedback Model Predictive Control (MPC)
algorithm for linear discrete-time systems affected by a possibly unbounded
additive noise and subject to probabilistic constraints. In case the noise
distribution is unknown, the chance constraints on the input and state
variables are reformulated by means of the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality. The
recursive feasibility of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed and the
convergence of the state to a suitable neighbor of the origin is proved under
mild assumptions. The implementation issues are thoroughly addressed showing
that, with a proper choice of the design parameters, its computational load can
be made similar to the one of a standard stabilizing MPC algorithm. Two
examples are discussed in details, with the aim of providing an insight on the
performance achievable by the proposed control scheme."
"Determining the induced L2 norm of a linear, parameter-varying (LPV) system
is an integral part of many analysis and robust control design procedures. Most
prior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced L2
norm. The conditions for upper bounds are typically based on scaled small-gain
theorems with dynamic multipliers or dissipation inequalities with parameter
dependent Lyapunov functions. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to
compute lower bounds for the induced L2 norm. The proposed approach computes a
lower bound on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a
periodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact
calculation of the L2 norm for a periodic linear time varying system. The
proposed lower bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound
complements standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between
the bounds indicates that further computation, e.g. upper bounds with more
complex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound algorithm
returns a bad parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further
analyzed to provide insight into the system performance."
"This paper studies zeros of networked linear systems with time-invariant
interconnection topology. While the characterization of zeros is given for both
heterogeneous and homogeneous networks, homogeneous networks are explored in
greater detail. In the current paper, for homogeneous networks with
time-invariant interconnection dynamics, it is illustrated how the zeros of
each individual agent's system description and zeros definable from the
interconnection dynamics contribute to generating zeros of the whole network.
We also demonstrate how zeros of networked systems and those of their
associated blocked versions are related."
"We assume that a finite set of moments of a random vector is given. Its
underlying density is unknown. An algorithm is proposed for efficiently
calculating Dirac mixture densities maintaining these moments while providing a
homogeneous coverage of the state space."
"This two-part paper presents a feedback-based cross-layer framework for
distributed sensing and estimation of a dynamic process by a wireless sensor
network (WSN). Sensor nodes wirelessly communicate measurements to the fusion
center (FC). Cross-layer factors such as packet collisions and the
sensing-transmission costs are considered. Each SN adapts its
sensing-transmission action based on its own local observation quality and the
estimation quality feedback from the FC under cost constraints for each SN. In
this first part, the optimization complexity is reduced by exploiting the
statistical symmetry and large network approximation of the WSN. Structural
properties of the optimal policy are derived for a coordinated and a
decentralized scheme. It is proved that a dense WSN provides sensing diversity,
so that only a few SNs with the best local observation quality need to be
activated, despite the fluctuations of the WSN. The optimal policy dictates
that, when the estimation quality is poor, only the best SNs activate,
otherwise all SNs remain idle to preserve energy. The costs of coordination and
feedback are evaluated, revealing the scalability of the decentralized scheme
to large WSNs, at the cost of performance degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate cost savings from 30% to 70% over a non-adaptive scheme, and
significant gains over a previously proposed estimator which does not consider
these cross-layer factors."
"This two-part paper presents a feedback-based cross-layer framework for
distributed sensing and estimation of a dynamic process by a wireless sensor
network (WSN). Sensor nodes wirelessly communicate measurements to the fusion
center (FC). Cross-layer factors such as packet collisions and the
sensing-transmission costs are considered. Each SN adapts its
sensing-transmission action based on its own local observation quality and the
estimation quality feedback from the FC under cost constraints for each SN. In
this second part, low-complexity myopic sensing-transmission policies (MPs) are
designed to optimize a trade-off between performance and the cost incurred by
each SN. The MP is computed in closed form for a coordinated scheme, whereas an
iterative algorithm is presented for a decentralized one, which converges to a
local optimum. The MP dictates that, when the estimation quality is poor, only
the best SNs activate, otherwise all SNs remain idle to preserve energy. For
both schemes, the threshold on the estimation quality below which the SNs
remain idle is derived in closed form, and is shown to be independent of the
number of channels. It is also proved that a single channel suffices for
severely energy constrained WSNs. The proposed MPs are shown to yield
near-optimal performance with respect to the optimal policy of Part I, at a
fraction of the complexity, thus being more suitable for practical WSN
deployments."
"With quadrotor use seeing extensive growth in recent years, the autonomous
control of these Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an increasing relevant and
intersting field. In this paper a linear state-space approach at designing a
stable hover controller in the presence of disturbances is presented along with
simulation of control system performance. Additionally the design of a tracking
system, for linear inertial position and yaw, is presented with simulation
results. The gain matrix developed for this control system is independent of
the specific quadrotor parameters, meaning that this same gain matrix can be
used on a wide variety of quadrotors without modification. The hover and
tracking controllers designed in this paper proved to perform well in
simulation under perturbation disturbances and normally distributed
disturbances on the UAVs linear speeds and angular speeds."
"The paper presents a novel approach for the analysis and control of a
multi-agent system with non-identical agents and a path-graph topology. With
the help of irrational wave transfer functions, the approach describes the
interaction among the agents from the `local' perspective and identifies
travelling waves in the system. It is shown that different dynamics of the
agents creates a virtual boundary that causes a partial reflection of the
travelling waves. Undesired effects due to the reflection of the waves, such as
amplification/attenuation, long transients or string instability, can be
compensated by the feedback controllers introduced in this paper. We show that
the controllers achieve asymptotic and even string stability of the system."
"A novel method for distributed estimation of the frequency of power systems
is introduced based on the cooperation between multiple measurement nodes. The
proposed distributed widely linear complex Kalman filter (D-ACKF) and the
distributed widely linear extended complex Kalman filter (D-AECKF) employ a
widely linear state space and augmented complex statistics to deal with
unbalanced system conditions and the generality complex signals, both second
order circular (proper) and second order noncircular (improper). It is shown
that the current, strictly linear, estimators are inadequate for unbalanced
systems, a typical case in smart grids, as they do not account for either the
noncircularity of Clarke's \alpha \beta-voltage in unbalanced conditions or the
correlated nature of nodal disturbances. We illuminate the relationship between
the degree of circularity of Clarke's voltage and system imbalance, and prove
that the proposed widely linear estimators are optimal for such conditions,
while also accounting for the correlated and noncircular nature of real-world
nodal disturbances. {Synthetic and real world} case studies over a range of
power system conditions illustrate the theoretical and practical advantages of
the proposed methodology."
"Due to various green initiatives, renewable energy will be massively
incorporated into the future smart grid. However, the intermittency of the
renewables may result in power imbalance, thus adversely affecting the
stability of a power system. Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the
power balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may
be connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation
of EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However,
V2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently.
Thus it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a
preliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network,
whose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and
regulation-down, separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can
be used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the
grid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we
extend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism which
can adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the
actual system follow the analytical model."
"This paper presents a simple framework of low cost Kit which can be used in
control education and training courses to support hardware in the loop
simulation. The kit shows the student or control engineer the effect of delays,
noise, and saturation on the control system. The framework is generic and
flexible to give the user the ability to test and simulate any controller on
any process. The framework uses Matlab environment which gives the user many
tools to build is/her system in a fast and accurate way. Some test cases are
presented for using the framework on different controllers."
"We analyze the convergence aspects of the invariant extended Kalman filter
(IEKF), when the latter is used as a deterministic non-linear observer on Lie
groups, for continuous-time systems with discrete observations. One of the main
features of invariant observers for left-invariant systems on Lie groups is
that the estimation error is autonomous. In this paper we first generalize this
result by characterizing the (much broader) class of systems for which this
property holds. Then, we leverage the result to prove for those systems the
local stability of the IEKF around any trajectory, under the standard
conditions of the linear case. One mobile robotics example and one inertial
navigation example illustrate the interest of the approach. Simulations
evidence the fact that the EKF is capable of diverging in some challenging
situations, where the IEKF with identical tuning keeps converging."
"Most current results on coverage control using mobile sensors require that
one partitioned cell is the sole responsibility of one sensor. In this paper,
we consider a class of generalized Voronoi coverage control problems by using
higher order Voronoi partitions, motivated by applications that more than one
senor is required to monitor and cover onecell. We introduce a framework
depending on a coverage performance function incorporating higher order Voronoi
cells and then design a gradient-based controller which allows the multi-sensor
system to achieve a local equilibrium in a distributed manner. In addition, we
provide a number of real world scenarios where our framework can be applied.
Simulation results are also provided to show the controller performance."
"We consider the problem of fusing measurements from multiple sensors, where
the sensing regions overlap and data are non-negative---possibly resulting from
a count of indistinguishable discrete entities. Because of overlaps, it is, in
general, impossible to fuse this information to arrive at an accurate estimate
of the overall amount or count of material present in the union of the sensing
regions. Here we study the range of overall values consistent with the data.
Posed as a linear programming problem, this leads to interesting questions
associated with the geometry of the sensor regions, specifically, the
arrangement of their non-empty intersections. We define a computational tool
called the fusion polytope and derive a condition for this to be in the
positive orthant thus simplifying calculations. We show that, in two
dimensions, inflated tiling schemes based on rectangular regions fail to
satisfy this condition, whereas inflated tiling schemes based on hexagons do."
"A controllable network can be driven from any initial state to any desired
state using driver nodes. A set of driver nodes to control a network is not
unique. It is important to characterize these driver nodes and select the right
driver nodes. The work discusses theory and algorithms to select driver node
such that largest region of attraction can be obtained considering limited
capacity of driver node and with unstable eigenvalues of adjacency matrix. A
network which can be controllable using one driver node is considered.
Nonuniqueness of driver node poses a challenge to select right driver node when
multiple possibilities exist. The work addresses this issue."
"Uncoordinated charging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have a
negative impact on the secure and economic operation of the power system,
especially at the distribution level. Given that the charging load of EVs can
be controlled to some extent, research on the optimal charging control of EVs
has been extensively carried out. In this paper, two possible smart charging
scenarios in China are studied: centralized optimal charging operated by an
aggregator and decentralized optimal charging managed by individual users.
Under the assumption that the aggregators and individual users only concern the
economic benefits, new load peaks will arise under time of use (TOU) pricing
which is extensively employed in China. To solve this problem, a simple
incentive mechanism is proposed for centralized optimal charging while a
rolling-update pricing scheme is devised for decentralized optimal charging.
The original optimal charging models are modified to account for the developed
schemes. Simulated tests corroborate the efficacy of optimal scheduling for
charging EVs in various scenarios."
"We consider platoons composed of identical vehicles with an asymmetric
nearest-neighbor interaction. We restrict ourselves to intervehicular coupling
realized with dynamic arbitrary-order onboard controllers such that the
coupling to the immediately preceding vehicle is proportional to the coupling
to the immediately following vehicle. Each vehicle is modeled using a transfer
function and we impose no restriction on the order of the vehicle. The platoon
is described by a transfer function in a convenient product form. We
investigate how the H-infinity norm and the steady-state gain of the platoon
scale with the number of vehicles. We conclude that if the open-loop transfer
function of the vehicle contains two or more integrators and the Fiedler
eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is uniformly bounded from below, the norm
scales exponentially with the growing distance in the graph. If there is just
one integrator in the open loop, we give a condition under which the norm of
the transfer function is bounded by its steady-state gain - the platoon is
string-stable. Moreover, we argue that in this case it is always possible to
design a controller the predecessor following strategy."
"In this preliminary work, we propose to use a polynomial approach in order to
study the stability of switched systems. The proposed strategy is based on the
Bernstein interpolation method that may transform a switched system into a
polynomial expression from which an associated ""simple"" Lyapunov function can
be eventually built. The HOL Light proof assistant allows verifying formally
the Lyapunov functions that are identified from the proposed switching
structure. Our approach is illustrated by numerical examples."
"In this paper, we propose an approximate Bayesian computation approach to
perform a multiple target tracking within a binary sensor network. The nature
of the binary sensors (getting closer - moving away information) do not allow
the use of the classical tools (e.g. Kalman Filter, Particle Filer), because
the exact likelihood is intractable. To overcome this, we use the particular
feature of the likelihood-free algorithms to produce an efficient multiple
target tracking methodology."
"Lithium ion batteries are promising for small off- grid energy storage
applications in developing countries because of their high energy density and
long life. However, costs are prohibitive. Instead, we consider 'used' Li-ion
batteries for this application, finding experimentally that many discarded
laptop cells, for example, still have good capacity and cycle life. In order to
make safe and optimal use of such cells, we present a modular power management
system using a separate power converter for every cell. This novel approach
allows individual batteries to be used to their full capacity. The power
converters operate in voltage droop control mode to provide easy charge
balancing and implement a battery management system to estimate the capacity of
each cell, as we demonstrate experimentally."
"In this paper, the design of the optimal decentralized state-feedback
controllers is considered for a wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN)
with stochastic network-induced delays and packet losses. In particular, taking
advantage of multiple controllers, we model the WSAN as a wireless networked
control system (NCS) with decentralized controllers, and then formulate the
stochastic optimal state-feedback control problem as a non-cooperative linear
quadratic (LQ) game. The optimal control law of each controller is obtained
that is a function of the current plant state and all past control signals. The
performance of the proposed stochastic optimal control algorithm is
investigated using both a genetic control system and a load frequency control
(LFC) system in power grid."
"The vulnerability of false data injection attacks on real-time electricity
pricing for the power grid market has been recently explored. Previous work has
focused on the impact caused by attackers that compromise pricing signals and
send false prices to a subset of consumers. In this paper we extend previous
work by considering a more powerful and general adversary model, a new analysis
method based on sensitivity functions, and by proposing several countermeasures
that can mitigate the negative impact of these attacks. Countermeasures include
adding a low-pass filter to the pricing signals, selecting the time interval
between price updates, selecting parameters of the controller, designing robust
control algorithms, and by detecting anomalies in the behavior of the system."
"We consider the problem of computing the set of initial states of a dynamical
system such that there exists a control strategy to ensure that the
trajectories satisfy a temporal logic specification with probability 1
(almost-surely). We focus on discrete-time, stochastic linear dynamics and
specifications given as formulas of the Generalized Reactivity(1) fragment of
Linear Temporal Logic over linear predicates in the states of the system. We
propose a solution based on iterative abstraction-refinement, and turn-based
2-player probabilistic games. While the theoretical guarantee of our algorithm
after any finite number of iterations is only a partial solution, we show that
if our algorithm terminates, then the result is the set of satisfying initial
states. Moreover, for any (partial) solution our algorithm synthesizes witness
control strategies to ensure almost-sure satisfaction of the temporal logic
specification. We demonstrate our approach on an illustrative case study."
"This paper addresses the distributed consensus design problem for linear
multi-agent systems with directed communication graphs and external
disturbances. Both the cases with strongly connected communication graphs and
leader-follower graphs containing a directed spanning tree with the leader as
the root are discussed. Distributed adaptive consensus protocols based on the
relative states of neighboring agents are designed, which can ensure the
ultimate boundedness of the consensus error and adaptive gains in the presence
of external disturbances. The upper bounds of the consensus error are further
explicitly given. Compared to the existing consensus protocols, the merit of
the adaptive protocols proposed in this paper is that they can be computed and
implemented in a fully distributed fashion and meanwhile are robust with
respect to external disturbances."
"In this paper, we extend the popular integral control technique to systems
evolving on Lie groups. More explicitly, we provide an alternative definition
of ""integral action"" for proportional(-derivative)-controlled systems whose
configuration evolves on a nonlinear space, where configuration errors cannot
be simply added up to compute a definite integral. We then prove that the
proposed integral control allows to cancel the drift induced by a constant bias
in both first order (velocity) and second order (torque) control inputs for
fully actuated systems evolving on abstract Lie groups. We illustrate the
approach by 3-dimensional motion control applications."
"This paper presents a new black-box technique for modeling long term memory
effects in radio frequency power amplifiers. The proposed technique extends
commonly used behavioral models by utilizing parameters that dynamically change
depending on a long term memory effect while keeping the original model
structure intact. This enables us to accurately track and model transient
changes in power amplifier characteristics that vary slowly and are induced by
the input signal.
  Identification of long term memory effects is discussed and an iterative
identification algorithm for the model parameters is proposed. The model is
experimentally tested on a 100 Watt Doherty power amplifier with a 4 MHz
Gaussian noise signal that has a step--like change in the amplitude,
representative of a realistic communication signal with bursty behavior and a
20 MHz 3GPP LTE test data. Results of behavioral modeling show a 2-2.5 dB and
5-6 dB improvement in average and peak NMSE modeling performance respectively,
which shows the suitability of the technique to model bursty signals."
"This paper presents an investigation into parameter adaptation in behavioral
model--based digital predistortion for radio frequency power amplifiers. A
novel measurement setup framework that emulates real--time adaptation in
transmitters is developed that allows evaluation of different parameters,
configurations and adaptation algorithms. This setup relieves the need for full
feedback loops for parameter adaptation while providing the flexibility needed
in the design process of parameter adaptation.
  Issues such as convergence speed, sensitivity to quantization noise in the
feedback loop and predistortion performance are investigated for some different
parameter update algorithms using the proposed measurement setup. The approach
presented in this paper allows the possibility to analyze different aspects of
digital predistortion adaptation algorithms, and is an important enabling step
for further research on parameter adaptation before the real--time hardware is
implemented for use."
"In this paper, the maximum entropy property of the discrete-time first-order
stable spline kernel is studied. The advantages of studying this property in
discrete-time domain instead of continuous-time domain are outlined. One of
such advantages is that the differential entropy rate is well-defined for
discrete-time stochastic processes. By formulating the maximum entropy problem
for discrete-time stochastic processes we provide a simple and self-contained
proof to show what maximum entropy property the discrete-time first-order
stable spline kernel has."
"This paper investigates the stability of Kalman filtering over
Gilbert-Elliott channels where random packet drop follows a time-homogeneous
two-state Markov chain whose state transition is determined by a pair of
failure and recovery rates. First of all, we establish a relaxed condition
guaranteeing peak-covariance stability described by an inequality in terms of
the spectral radius of the system matrix and transition probabilities of the
Markov chain. We further show that that condition can be interpreted using a
linear matrix inequality feasibility problem. Next, we prove that the
peak-covariance stability implies mean-square stability, if the system matrix
has no defective eigenvalues on the unit circle. This connection between the
two stability notions holds for any random packet drop process. We prove that
there exists a critical curve in the failure-recovery rate plane, below which
the Kalman filter is mean-square stable and no longer mean-square stable above,
via a coupling method in stochastic processes. Finally, a lower bound for this
critical failure rate is obtained making use of the relationship we establish
between the two stability criteria, based on an approximate relaxation of the
system matrix."
"This paper studies the problem of interacting multiple model (IMM) estimation
for jump Markov linear systems with unknown measurement noise covariance. The
system state and the unknown covariance are jointly estimated in the framework
of Bayesian estimation, where the unknown covariance is modeled as a random
matrix according to an inverse-Wishart distribution. For the IMM estimation
with random matrices, one difficulty encountered is the combination of a set of
weighted inverse-Wishart distributions. Instead of using the moment matching
approach, this difficulty is overcome by minimizing the weighted
Kullback-Leibler divergence for inverse-Wishart distributions. It is shown that
a closed form solution can be derived for the optimization problem and the
resulting solution coincides with an inverse-Wishart distribution. Simulation
results show that the proposed filter performs better than the previous work
using the moment matching approach."
"A mathematical state-of-charge evolution equation is present for Flywheel
Energy Storage Systems."
"We model thermostatic devices using a stochastic hybrid description, and
introduce an external actuation mechanism that creates random switch events in
the discrete dynamics. We then conjecture the form of the Fokker-Planck
equation and successfully verify it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations.
The actuation mechanism and subsequent modeling result are relevant for power
system operation."
"This paper presents a UAV-based optimal crop-dusting method to control
anomalously diffusing infestation of crops. Two anomalous diffusion models are
considered, which are, respectively, time-fractional order diffusion equation
and space-fractional order diffusion equation. Our problem formulation is
motivated by real-time pest management by using networked unmanned cropdusters
where the pest spreading is modeled as a fractional diffusion equation. We
attempt to solve the optimal dynamic location of actuators by using Centroidal
Voronoi Tessellations. A new simulation platform (FO-DiffMAS-2D) for
measurement scheduling and controls in fractional order distributed parameter
systems is also introduced in this paper. Simulation results are presented to
show the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as the role of fractional
order in the overall control performance."
"Semi-active suspensions have drawn particular attention due to their superior
performance over the other types of suspensions. One of their advantages is
that their damping coefficient can be controlled without the need for any
external source of power. In this study, three control approaches are
implemented on a quarter-car model using MATLAB/Simulink. The investigated
control methodologies are Acceleration Driven Damper, Power Driven Damper, and
H_infinity Robust Control. The three controllers are known as comfort-oriented
approaches. H_infinity Robust Control is an advanced method that guarantees
transient performance and rejects external disturbances. It is shown that
H_infinity with the proposed modification, has the best performance although
its relatively high cost of computation could be potentially considered as a
drawback."
"This paper proposes a strategy to estimate the velocity and position of
neighbor agents using distance measurements only. Since with agents executing
arbitrary motions, instantaneous distance-only measurements cannot provide
enough information for our objectives, we postulate that agents engage in a
combination of circular motion and linear motion. The proposed estimator can be
used to develop control algorithms where only distance measurements are
available to each agent. As an example, we show how this estimation method can
be used to control the formation shape and velocity of the agents in a multi
agent system. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of
the proposed algorithm."
"The Kaczmarz algorithm (KA) is a popular method for solving a system of
linear equations. In this note we derive a new exponential convergence result
for the KA. The key allowing us to establish the new result is to rewrite the
KA in such a way that its solution path can be interpreted as the output from a
particular dynamical system. The asymptotic stability results of the
corresponding dynamical system can then be leveraged to prove exponential
convergence of the KA. The new bound is also compared to existing bounds."
"The recursive direct weight optimization method is used to solve challenging
nonlinear system identification problems. This note provides a new derivation
and a new interpretation of the method. The key underlying the note is to
acknowledge and exploit a certain structure inherent in the problem."
"Phase-locked loops (PLL), Costas loops and other synchronizing circuits are
featured by the presence of a nonlinear phase detector, described by a periodic
nonlinearity. In general, nonlinearities can cause complex behavior of the
system such multi-stability and chaos. However, even phase locking may be
guaranteed under any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit
can be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error
caused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e.g. to demodulation and
decoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error
oscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits
extremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in
this direction, available in the literature, examine the probability density of
the phase error and expected number of slipped cycles under stochastic noise in
the signal. At the same time, cycle slipping occurs also in deterministic
systems with periodic nonlinearities, depending on the initial conditions,
properties of the linear part and the periodic nonlinearity and other factors
such as delays in the loop. In the present paper we give analytic estimates for
the number of slipped cycles in PLL-based systems, governed by
integro-differential equations, allowing to capture effects of high-order
dynamics, discrete and distributed delays. We also consider the effects of
singular small parameter perturbations on the cycle slipping behavior."
"Many systems, arising in electrical and electronic engineering are based on
controlled phase synchronization of several periodic processes (""phase
synchronization"" systems, or PSS). Typically such systems are featured by the
gradient-like behavior, i.e. the system has infinite sequence of equilibria
points, and any solution converges to one of them. This property however says
nothing about the transient behavior of the system, whose important qualitative
index is the maximal phase error. The synchronous regime of gradient-like
system may be preceded by cycle slipping, i.e. the increase of the absolute
phase error. Since the cycle slipping is considered to be undesired behavior of
PSSs, it is important to find efficient estimates for the number of slipped
cycles. In the present paper, we address the problem of cycle-slipping for
phase synchronization systems described by integro-differential Volterra
equations with a small parameter at the higher derivative. New effective
estimates for a number of slipped cycles are obtained by means of Popov's
method of ""a priori integral indices"". The estimates are uniform with respect
to the small parameter."
"Increasing shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources induce higher and
higher power flow variability at the transmission level. The question arises as
to what extent existing networks can absorb additional fluctuating power
injection without exceeding thermal limits. At the same time, the resulting
power flow characteristics call for revisiting classical approaches to line
temperature prediction. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling and
simulation methodology for estimating the occurrence of critical line
temperatures in the presence of fluctuating power flows. Cumbersome integration
of the dynamic thermal equations at each Monte Carlo simulation trial is sped
up by a specific algorithm that makes use of a variance reduction technique
adapted from the telecommunications field. The substantial reduction in
computational time allows estimations closer to real time, relevant to
short-term operational assessments. A case study performed on a single line
model provides fundamental insights into the probability of hitting critical
line temperatures under given power flow fluctuations. A transmission system
application shows how the proposed method can be used for a fast yet accurate
operational assessment."
"This paper studies the containment control problem of multi-agent systems
with multiple dynamic leaders in both the discrete-time domain and the
continuous-time domain. The leaders' motions are described by $(n-1)$-order
polynomial trajectories. This setting makes practical sense because given some
critical points, the leaders' trajectories are usually planned by the
polynomial interpolations. In order to drive all followers into the convex hull
spanned by the leaders, a $PI^n$-type ($P$ and $I$ are short for {\it
Proportion} and {\it Integration}, respectively; $I^n$ implies that the
algorithm includes high-order integral terms) containment algorithm is
proposed. It is theoretically proved that the $PI^n$-type containment algorithm
is able to solve the containment problem of multi-agent systems where the
followers are described by any order integral dynamics. Compared with the
previous results on the multi-agent systems with dynamic leaders, the
distinguished features of this paper are that: (1) the containment problem is
studied not only in the continuous-time domain but also in the discrete-time
domain while most existing results only work in the continuous-time domain; (2)
to deal with the leaders with the $(n-1)$-order polynomial trajectories,
existing results require the follower's dynamics to be $n$-order integral while
the followers considered in this paper can be described by any-order integral;
and (3) the ""sign"" function is not employed in the proposed algorithm, which
avoids the chattering phenomenon. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the
practical value of the proposed approach, an application, the containment
control of multiple mobile robots is studied. Finally, two simulation examples
are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
"This paper is concerned with the optimal approximation of a given
multivariate Dirac mixture, i.e., a density comprising weighted Dirac
distributions on a continuous domain, by an equally weighted Dirac mixture with
a reduced number of components. The parameters of the approximating density are
calculated by minimizing a smooth global distance measure, a generalization of
the well-known Cram\'{e}r-von Mises Distance to the multivariate case. This
generalization is achieved by defining an alternative to the classical
cumulative distribution, the Localized Cumulative Distribution (LCD), as a
characterization of discrete random quantities (on continuous domains), which
is unique and symmetric also in the multivariate case. The resulting
approximation method provides the basis for various efficient nonlinear state
and parameter estimation methods."
"The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and environmental concerns has
given awareness on generation of renewable energy resources. Among the various
renewable resources, hybrid solar and wind energy seems to be promising
solutions to provide reliable power supply with improved system efficiency and
reduced storage requirements for stand-alone applications. This paper presents
a feasibility assessment and optimum size of photovoltaic (PV) array, wind
turbine and battery bank for a standalone hybrid Solar/Wind Power system
(HSWPS) at remote telecom station of Nepal at Latitude (27{\deg}23'50"") and
Longitude (86{\deg}44'23"") consisting a telecommunication load of Very Small
Aperture Terminal (VSAT), Repeater station and Code Division Multiple Access
Base Transceiver Station (CDMA 2C10 BTS). In any RES based system, the
feasibility assessment is considered as the first step analysis. In this work,
feasibility analysis is carried through hybrid optimization model for electric
renewables (HOMER) and mathematical models were implemented in the MATLAB
environment to perform the optimal configuration for a given load and a desired
loss of power supply probability (LPSP) from a set of systems components with
the lowest value of cost function defined in terms of reliability and levelized
unit electricity cost (LUCE). The simulation results for the existing and the
proposed models are compared. The simulation results shows that existing
architecture consisting of 6.12 kW KC85T photovoltaic modules, 1kW H3.1 wind
turbine and 1600 Ah GFM-800 battery bank have a 36.6% of unmet load during a
year. On the other hand, the proposed system includes 1kW *2 H3.1 Wind turbine,
8.05 kW TSM-175DA01 photovoltaic modules and 1125 Ah T-105 battery bank with
system reliability of 99.99% with a significant cost reduction as well as
reliable energy production."
"Synchronization underlies phenomena including memory and perception in the
brain, coordinated motion of animal flocks, and stability of the power grid.
These synchronization phenomena are often modeled through networks of
phase-coupled oscillating nodes. Heterogeneity in the node dynamics, however,
may prevent such networks from achieving the required level of synchronization.
In order to guarantee synchronization, external inputs can be used to pin a
subset of nodes to a reference frequency, while the remaining nodes are steered
toward synchronization via local coupling. In this paper, we present a
submodular optimization framework for selecting a set of nodes to act as
external inputs in order to achieve synchronization from almost any initial
network state. We derive threshold-based sufficient conditions for
synchronization, and then prove that these conditions are equivalent to
connectivity of a class of augmented network graphs. Based on this connection,
we map the sufficient conditions for synchronization to constraints on
submodular functions, leading to efficient algorithms with provable optimality
bounds for selecting input nodes. We illustrate our approach via numerical
studies of synchronization in networks from power systems, wireless networks,
and neuronal networks."
"When power grids are heavily stressed with a bulk power transfer, it is
useful to have a fast indication of the increased stress when multiple line
outages occur. Reducing the bulk power transfer when the outages are severe
could forestall further cascading of the outages. We show that synchrophasor
measurements of voltage angles at all the area tie lines can be used to
indicate the severity of multiple outages. These synchrophasor measurements are
readily combined into an ""area angle"" that can quickly track the severity of
multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds
for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred
through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would
monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur
to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of
power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in
which separate actions to resolve local power distribution problems are needed.
We illustrate the thresholds and monitoring with the area angle across several
states of Northwestern USA."
"Consider the $n$-th integrator $\dot x=J_nx+\sigma(u)e_n$, where
$x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $u\in \mathbb{R}$, $J_n$ is the $n$-th Jordan block and
$e_n=(0\ \cdots 0\ 1)^T\in\mathbb{R}^n$. We provide easily implementable state
feedback laws $u=k(x)$ which not only render the closed-loop system globally
asymptotically stable but also are finite-gain $L_p$-stabilizing with
arbitrarily small gain. These $L_p$-stabilizing state feedbacks are built from
homogeneous feedbacks appearing in finite-time stabilization of linear systems.
We also provide additional $L_\infty$-stabilization results for the case of
both internal and external disturbances of the $n$-th integrator, namely for
the perturbed system $\dot x=J_nx+e_n\sigma (k(x)+d)+D$ where $d\in\mathbb{R}$
and $D\in\mathbb{R}^n$."
"We propose an encoding and control strategy for the stabilization of switched
systems with limited information, supposing the controller is given for each
mode. Only the quantized output and the active mode of the plant at each
sampling time are transmitted to the controller. Due to switching, the active
mode of the plant may be different from that of the controller in the
closed-loop system. Hence if switching occurs, the quantizer must recalculate a
bounded set containing the estimation error for quantization at the next
sampling time. We establish the global asymptotic stability under a
slow-switching assumption on dwell time and average dwell time. To this end, we
construct multiple discrete-time Lyapunov functions with respect to the
estimated state and the size of the bounded set."
"A parameter space procedure for designing chosen parameters of a repetitive
controller to satisfy a robust performance criterion is presented. Using this
method, low order robust repetitive controllers can be designed and implemented
for plants that possibly include time delay, poles on the imaginary axis and
discontinuous weights. A design and simulation study based on a high speed
atomic force microscope position control example is utilized to illustrate the
method presented in this paper."
"Vehicular energy network (VEN) is a vehicular network which can transport
energy over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs). In
the near future, an abundance of EVs, plentiful generation of the renewables,
and mature wireless energy transfer and vehicular communication technologies
will expedite the realization of VEN. To transmit energy from a source to a
destination, we need to establish energy paths, which are composed of segments
of vehicular routes, while satisfying various design objectives. In this paper,
we develop a method to construct all energy paths for a particular energy
source-destination pair, followed by some analytical results of the method. We
describe how to utilize the energy paths to develop optimization models for
different design goals and propose two solutions. We also develop a heuristic
for the power loss minimization problem. We compare the performance of the
three solution methods with artificial and real-world traffic networks and
provide a comprehensive comparison in terms of solution quality, computation
time, solvable problem size, and applicability. This paper lays the foundations
of VEN routing."
"Hypothesis testing methods that do not rely on exact distribution assumptions
have been emerging lately. The method of sign-perturbed sums (SPS) is capable
of characterizing confidence regions with exact confidence levels for linear
regression and linear dynamical systems parameter estimation problems if the
noise distribution is symmetric. This paper describes a general family of
hypothesis testing methods that have an exact user chosen confidence level
based on finite sample count and without relying on an assumed noise
distribution. It is shown that the SPS method belongs to this family and we
provide another hypothesis test for the case where the symmetry assumption is
replaced with exchangeability. In the case of linear regression problems it is
shown that the confidence regions are connected, bounded and possibly
non-convex sets in both cases. To highlight the importance of understanding the
structure of confidence regions corresponding to such hypothesis tests it is
shown that confidence sets for linear dynamical systems parameter estimates
generated using the SPS method can have non-connected parts, which have far
reaching consequences."
"The so-called constrained least mean-square algorithm is one of the most
commonly used linear-equality-constrained adaptive filtering algorithms. Its
main advantages are adaptability and relative simplicity. In order to gain
analytical insights into the performance of this algorithm, we examine its
mean-square performance and derive theoretical expressions for its transient
and steady-state mean-square deviation. Our methodology is inspired by the
principle of energy conservation in adaptive filters. Simulation results
corroborate the accuracy of the derived formula."
"This paper considers the real-time power quality monitoring in power grid
systems. The goal is to detect the occurrence of disturbances in the nominal
sinusoidal voltage/current signal as quickly as possible such that protection
measures can be taken in time. Based on an autoregressive (AR) model for the
disturbance, we propose a generalized local likelihood ratio (GLLR) detector
which processes meter readings sequentially and alarms as soon as the test
statistic exceeds a prescribed threshold. The proposed detector not only reacts
to a wide range of disturbances, but also achieves lower detection delay
compared to the conventional block processing method. Then we further propose
to deploy multiple meters to monitor the power signal cooperatively. The
distributed meters communicate wirelessly to a central meter, where the data
fusion and detection are performed. In light of the limited bandwidth of
wireless channels, we develop a level-triggered sampling scheme, where each
meter transmits only one-bit each time asynchronously. The proposed multi-meter
scheme features substantially low communication overhead, while its performance
is close to that of the ideal case where distributed meter readings are
perfectly available at the central meter."
"Over the last few years, sampling-based stochastic optimal control (SOC)
frameworks have shown impressive performances in reinforcement learning (RL)
with applications in robotics. However, such approaches require a large amount
of samples from many interactions with the physical systems. To improve
learning efficiency, we present a novel model-based and data-driven SOC
framework based on path integral formulation and Gaussian processes (GPs). The
proposed approach learns explicit and time-varying optimal controls
autonomously from limited sampled data. Based on this framework, we propose an
iterative control scheme with improved applicability in higher-dimensional and
more complex control tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed framework using two nontrivial examples. Compared to
state-of-the-art RL methods, the proposed framework features superior control
learning efficiency."
"In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for the identification of
Hammerstein systems. Adopting a Bayesian approach, we model the impulse
response of the unknown linear dynamic system as a realization of a zero-mean
Gaussian process. The covariance matrix (or kernel) of this process is given by
the recently introduced stable-spline kernel, which encodes information on the
stability and regularity of the impulse response. The static non-linearity of
the model is identified using an Empirical Bayes approach, i.e. by maximizing
the output marginal likelihood, which is obtained by integrating out the
unknown impulse response. The related optimization problem is solved adopting a
novel iterative scheme based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method, where
each iteration consists in a simple sequence of update rules. Numerical
experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with a standard
algorithm for Hammerstein system identification."
"An advanced system of sensors/actuators should allow the direct feedback of a
sensed signal into an actuation, e.g., an action potential propagation through
an axon or a special cell activity might be sensed and suppressed by an
actuator through voltage stimulation or chemical delivery. Such a complex
procedure of sensing and stimulation calls for direct communication among these
sensors and actuators. In addition, minimizing the sensor/actuator to the size
of a biological cell can enable the cell-level automatic therapy. For this
objective, we propose such an approach to form a peer-to-peer network of
\emph{in vivo} sensors/actuators (S/As) that can be deployed with or even
inside biological cells. The S/As can communicate with each other via
electromagnetic waves of optical frequencies. In comparison with the comparable
techniques including the radio-frequency identification (RFID) and the wireless
sensor network (WSN), this technique is well adapted for the cell-level
sensing-actuating tasks considering the requirements on size, actuation speed,
signal-collision avoidance, etc."
"In this paper, we study the consensus problem for continuous-time and
discrete-time multi-agent systems in state-dependent switching networks. In
each case, we first consider the networks with fixed connectivity, in which the
communication between adjacent agents always exists but the influence could
possibly become negligible if the transmission distance is long enough. It is
obtained that consensus can be reached under a restriction of either the
decaying rate of the transmission weight or the initial states of the agents.
After then we investigate the networks with state-dependent connectivity, in
which the information transmission between adjacent agents gradually vanishes
if their distance exceeds a fixed range. In such networks, we prove that the
realization of consensus requires the validity of some initial conditions.
Finally, the conclusions are applied to models with the transmission law of C-S
model, opinion dynamics and the rendezvous problem, the corresponding
simulations are also presented."
"We present an adaptive smoother for linear state-space models with unknown
process and measurement noise covariances. The proposed method utilizes the
variational Bayes technique to perform approximate inference. The resulting
smoother is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and can be applied to
high dimensional linear systems. The performance of the algorithm is
illustrated on a target tracking example."
"The three-dimensional CMKF-U with only position measurements is extended to
solve the nonlinear tracking problem with range-rate measurements in this
paper. A pseudo measurement is constructed by the product of range and
range-rate measurements to reduce the high nonlinearity of the range-rate
measurements with respect to the target state; then the mean and covariance of
the converted measurement errors are derived by the measurement conditioned
method, showing better consistency than the transitional nested conditioning
method; finally, the sequential filter was used to process the converted
position and range-rate measurements sequentially to reduce the approximation
error in the second-order EKF. Monte Carlo simulations show that the
performance of the new tracking algorithm is better than the traditional one
based on CMKF-D."
"In this paper, we investigate a decentralized formation control algorithm for
an undirected formation control model. Unlike other formation control problems
where only the shape of a configuration counts, we emphasize here also its
Euclidean embedding. By following this decentralized formation control law, the
agents will converge to certain equilibrium of the control system. In
particular, we show that there is a quadratic Lyapunov function associated with
the formation control system whose unique local (global) minimum point is the
target configuration. In view of the fact that there exist multiple equilibria
(in fact, a continuum of equilibria) of the formation control system, and hence
there are solutions of the system which converge to some equilibria other than
the target configuration, we apply simulated annealing, as a heuristic method,
to the formation control law to fix this problem. Simulation results show that
sample paths of the modified stochastic system approach the target
configuration."
"In this paper, we investigate the controllability of a class of formation
control systems. Given a directed graph, we assign an agent to each of its
vertices and let the edges of the graph describe the information flow in the
system. We relate the strongly connected components of this graph to the
reachable set of the formation control system. Moreover, we show that the
formation control model is approximately path-controllable over a
path-connected, open dense subset as long as the graph is weakly connected and
satisfies some mild assumption on the numbers of vertices of the strongly
connected components."
"Gradient descent methods have been widely used for organizing multi-agent
systems, in which they can provide decentralized control laws with provable
convergence. Often, the control laws are designed so that two neighboring
agents repel/attract each other at a short/long distance of separation. When
the interactions between neighboring agents are moreover nonfading, the
potential function from which they are derived is radially unbounded. Hence,
the LaSalle's principle is sufficient to establish the system convergence. This
paper investigates, in contrast, a more realistic scenario where interactions
between neighboring agents have fading attractions. In such setting, the
LaSalle type arguments may not be sufficient. To tackle the problem, we
introduce a class of partitions, termed dilute partitions, of formations which
cluster agents according to the inter- and intra-cluster interaction strengths.
We then apply dilute partitions to trajectories of formations generated by the
multi-agent system, and show that each of the trajectories remains bounded
along the evolution, and converges to the set of equilibria."
"Hybrid systems whose mode dynamics are governed by non-linear ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) are often a natural model for biological
processes. However such models are difficult to analyze. To address this, we
develop a probabilistic analysis method by approximating the mode transitions
as stochastic events. We assume that the probability of making a mode
transition is proportional to the measure of the set of pairs of time points
and value states at which the mode transition is enabled. To ensure a sound
mathematical basis, we impose a natural continuity property on the non-linear
ODEs. We also assume that the states of the system are observed at discrete
time points but that the mode transitions may take place at any time between
two successive discrete time points. This leads to a discrete time Markov chain
as a probabilistic approximation of the hybrid system. We then show that for
BLTL (bounded linear time temporal logic) specifications the hybrid system
meets a specification iff its Markov chain approximation meets the same
specification with probability $1$. Based on this, we formulate a sequential
hypothesis testing procedure for verifying -approximately- that the Markov
chain meets a BLTL specification with high probability. Our case studies on
cardiac cell dynamics and the circadian rhythm indicate that our scheme can be
applied in a number of realistic settings."
"In this paper, we establish a few new synchronization conditions for complex
networks with nonlinear and nonidentical self-dynamics with switching directed
communication graphs. In light of the recent works on distributed sub-gradient
methods, we impose integral convexity for the nonlinear node self-dynamics in
the sense that the self-dynamics of a given node is the gradient of some
concave function corresponding to that node. The node couplings are assumed to
be linear but with switching directed communication graphs. Several sufficient
and/or necessary conditions are established for exact or approximate
synchronization over the considered complex networks. These results show when
and how nonlinear node self-dynamics may cooperate with the linear diffusive
coupling, which eventually leads to network synchronization conditions under
relaxed connectivity requirements."
"We propose a distributed algorithm for time synchronization in mobile
wireless sensor networks. Each node can employ the algorithm to estimate the
global time based on its local clock time. The problem of time synchronization
is formulated as nodes estimating their skews and offsets from noisy difference
measurements of offsets and logarithm of skews; the measurements acquired by
time-stamped message exchanges between neighbors. A distributed stochastic
approximation based algorithm is proposed to ensure that the estimation error
is mean square convergent (variance converging to 0) under certain conditions.
A sequence of scheduled update instants is used to meet the requirement of
decreasing time-varying gains that need to be synchronized across nodes with
unsynchronized clocks. Moreover, a modification on the algorithm is also
presented to improve the initial convergence speed. Simulations indicate that
highly accurate global time estimates can be achieved with the proposed
algorithm for long time durations, while the errors in competing algorithms
increase over time."
"In this paper, we investigate asymptotic stability of linear time-varying
systems with (sub-) stochastic system matrices. Motivated by distributed
dynamic fusion over networks of mobile agents, we impose some mild regularity
conditions on the elements of time-varying system matrices. We provide
sufficient conditions under which the asymptotic stability of the LTV system
can be guaranteed. By introducing the notion of slices, as non-overlapping
partitions of the sequence of systems matrices, we obtain stability conditions
in terms of the slice lengths and some network parameters. In addition, we
apply the LTV stability results to the distributed leader-follower algorithm,
and show the corresponding convergence and steady-state. An illustrative
example is also included to validate the effectiveness of our approach."
"In this paper, we investigate probabilistic stability of Kalman filtering
over fading channels modeled by $\ast$-mixing random processes, where channel
fading is allowed to generate non-stationary packet dropouts with temporal
and/or spatial correlations. Upper/lower almost sure (a.s.) stabilities and
absolutely upper/lower a.s. stabilities are defined for characterizing the
sample-path behaviors of the Kalman filtering. We prove that both upper and
lower a.s. stabilities follow a zero-one law, i.e., these stabilities must
happen with a probability either zero or one, and when the filtering system is
one-step observable, the absolutely upper and lower a.s. stabilities can also
be interpreted using a zero-one law. We establish general stability conditions
for (absolutely) upper and lower a.s. stabilities. In particular, with one-step
observability, we show the equivalence between absolutely a.s. stabilities and
a.s. ones, and necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of packet arrival
rate are derived; for the so-called non-degenerate systems, we also manage to
give a necessary and sufficient condition for upper a.s. stability."
"The transport and continuum equations exhibit a number of conservation laws.
For example, scalar multiplication is conserved by the transport equation,
while positivity of probabilities is conserved by the continuum equation.
Certain discretization techniques, such as particle based methods, conserve
these properties, but converge slower than spectral discretization methods on
smooth data. Standard spectral discretization methods, on the other hand, do
not conserve the invariants of the transport equation and the continuum
equation. This article constructs a novel spectral discretization technique
that conserves these important invariants while simultaneously preserving
spectral convergence rates. The performance of this proposed method is
illustrated on several numerical experiments."
"We consider a stochastic system where the communication between the
controller and the actuator is triggered by a threshold-based rule. The
communication is performed across an unreliable link that stochastically erases
transmitted packets. To decrease the communication burden, and as a partial
protection against dropped packets, the controller sends a sequence of control
commands to the actuator in each packet. These commands are stored in a buffer
and applied sequentially until the next control packet arrives. In this
context, we study dead-beat control laws and compute the expected
linear-quadratic loss of the closed-loop system for any given event-threshold.
Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions that quantify the trade-off
between the communication cost and the control performance of event-triggered
control systems. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework."
"In this paper we present a Fuzzy Logic control approach designed to stabilize
a multi-input multi-output magnetic suspension system. The system has four
cubic floaters and four actuators that apply magnetic forces on the floaters,
the suspension is performed by changing the voltages applied on the actuators,
hence changing their currents, producing vertical magnetic forces that balance
with the gravitational force. A fuzzy logic controller is used to control each
actuator; the system is nonlinear and sensitive to initial conditions. Another
fuzzy logic controller is used as a supervisory controller in order to increase
the dynamic range of the system, enabling it to stabilize the floaters when the
initial displacements are relatively big. Another design consideration was to
keep the four floaters in the same plane as much as possible, to perform that
task, a PD controller was set to modulate the currents of the four actuators in
order to minimize an error signal measuring the relative vertical displacement
of all the four floaters. Simulation results show that the designed control
scheme stabilized the system for the design constrains."
"A novel damage localization method is proposed, which is based on a
substructuring approach and makes use of Vector Auto-Regressive with eXogenous
input (VARX) models. The substructuring approach aims to divide the monitored
structure into several multi-DOF isolated substructures. Later, each individual
substructure is modeled by a VARX model, and the health of each substructure is
determined analyzing the variation of the VARX model. The method allows to
detect whether the isolated substructure is damaged, and besides allows to
locate the damage within the substructure. Only measured displacement data is
required to estimate the isolated substructure's VARX model. Moreover, it is
not necessary to have a priori knowledge of the structural model. The proposed
method is validated by simulations of an eight-storey shear building."
"This paper introduces a novel approach of clustering, which is based on group
consensus of dynamic linear high-order multi-agent systems. The graph topology
is associated with a selected multi-agent system, with each agent corresponding
to one vertex. In order to reveal the cluster structure, the agents belonging
to a similar cluster are expected to aggregate together. As theoretical
foundation, a necessary and sufficient condition is given to check the group
consensus. Two numerical instances are shown to illustrate the process of
approach."
"Substantial improvement in accuracy of identified linear time-invariant
single-input multi-output (SIMO) dynamical models is possible when the
disturbances affecting the output measurements are spatially correlated. Using
an orthogonal representation for the modules composing the SIMO structure, in
this paper we show that the variance of a parameter estimate of a module is
dependent on the model structure of the other modules, and the correlation
structure of the disturbances. In addition, we quantify the variance-error for
the parameter estimates for finite model orders, where the effect of noise
correlation structure, model structure and signal spectra are visible. From
these results, we derive the noise correlation structure under which the
mentioned model parameterization gives the lowest variance, when one module is
identified using less parameters than the other modules."
"A robust controller is developed for uncertain, second-order nonlinear
systems subject to simultaneous unknown, time-varying state delays and known,
time-varying input delays in addition to additive, sufficiently smooth
disturbances. An integral term composed of previous control values facilitates
a delay-free open-loop error system and the development of the feedback control
structure. A stability analysis based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals
guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded tracking under the assumption that the
delays are bounded and slowly varying."
"In this paper, it is shown that the solutions of general differentiable
constrained optimization problems can be viewed as asymptotic solutions to sets
of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The construction of the ODE
associated to the optimization problem is based on an exact penalty formulation
in which the weighting parameter dynamics is coordinated with that of the
decision variable so that there is no need to solve a sequence of optimization
problems, instead, a single ODE has to be solved using available efficient
methods. Examples are given in order to illustrate the results. This includes a
novel systematic approach to solve combinatoric optimization problems as well
as fast computation of a class of optimization problems using analogic circuits
leading to fast, parallel and highly scalable solutions."
"When faulty sensors are rare in a network, diagnosing sensors individually is
inefficient. This study introduces a novel use of concepts from group testing
and Kalman filtering in detecting these rare faulty sensors with significantly
fewer number of tests. By assigning sensors to groups and performing Kalman
filter-based fault detection over these groups, we obtain binary detection
outcomes, which can then be used to recover the fault state of all sensors. We
first present this method using combinatorial group testing. We then present a
novel adaptive group testing method based on Bayesian inference. This adaptive
method further reduces the number of required tests and is suitable for noisy
group test systems. Compared to non-group testing methods, our algorithm
achieves similar detection accuracy with fewer tests and thus lower
computational complexity. Compared to other adaptive group testing methods, the
proposed method achieves higher accuracy when test results are noisy. We
perform extensive numerical analysis using a set of real vibration data
collected from the New Carquinez Bridge in California using an 18-sensor
network mounted on the bridge. We also discuss how the features of the Kalman
filter-based group test can be exploited in forming groups and further
improving the detection accuracy."
"In this work we study the problem of rope sway dynamics control for elevator
systems. We choose to actuate the system with a semi-active damper mounted on
the top of the elevator car. We propose nonlinear controllers based on Lyapunov
theory, to actuate the semi-active damper and stabilize the rope sway dynamics.
We study the stability of the proposed controllers, and test their performances
on a numerical example."
"In this note we deal with a new observer for nonlinear systems of dimension n
in canonical observability form. We follow the standard high-gain paradigm, but
instead of having an observer of dimension n with a gain that grows up to power
n, we design an observer of dimension 2n-2 with a gain that grows up only to
power 2."
"The identification of multivariable state space models in innovation form is
solved in a subspace identification framework using convex nuclear norm
optimization. The convex optimization approach allows to include constraints on
the unknown matrices in the data-equation characterizing subspace
identification methods, such as the lower triangular block-Toeplitz of
weighting matrices constructed from the Markov parameters of the unknown
observer. The classical use of instrumental variables to remove the influence
of the innovation term on the data equation in subspace identification is
avoided. The avoidance of the instrumental variable projection step has the
potential to improve the accuracy of the estimated model predictions,
especially for short data length sequences. This is illustrated using a data
set from the DaSIy library. An efficient implementation in the framework of the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is presented that is used in
the validation study."
"This paper develops methods of distributed Bayesian hypothesis tests for
fault detection and diagnosis that are based on belief propagation and
optimization in graphical models. The main challenges in developing distributed
statistical estimation algorithms are i) difficulties in ensuring convergence
and consensus for solutions of distributed inference problems, ii) increasing
computational costs due to lack of scalability, and iii) communication
constraints for networked multi-agent systems. To cope with those challenges,
this manuscript considers i) belief propagation and optimization in graphical
models of complex distributed systems, ii) decomposition methods of
optimization for parallel and iterative computations, and iii) distributed
decision-making protocols."
"In this paper, we consider the peak-covariance stability of Kalman filtering
subject to packet losses. The length of consecutive packet losses is governed
by a time-homogeneous finite-state Markov chain. We establish a sufficient
condition for peak-covariance stability and show that this stability check can
be recast as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility problem. Comparing
with the literature, the stability condition given in this paper is invariant
with respect to similarity state transformations; moreover, our condition is
proved to be less conservative than the existing results. Numerical examples
are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our result."
"Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing provides an opportunity for industrial
users to cut electricity costs. Although many methods for Economic Load
Dispatch (ELD) under TOU pricing in continuous industrial processing have been
proposed, there are still difficulties in batch-type processing since power
load units are not directly adjustable and nonlinearly depend on production
planning and scheduling. In this paper, for hot rolling, a typical batch-type
and energy intensive process in steel industry, a production scheduling
optimization model for ELD is proposed under TOU pricing, in which the
objective is to minimize electricity costs while considering penalties caused
by jumps between adjacent slabs. A NSGA-II based multi-objective production
scheduling algorithm is developed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions, and then
TOPSIS based multi-criteria decision-making is performed to recommend an
optimal solution to facilitate filed operation. Experimental results and
analyses show that the proposed method cuts electricity costs in production,
especially in case of allowance for penalty score increase in a certain range.
Further analyses show that the proposed method has effect on peak load
regulation of power grid."
"Stochastic processes offer a flexible mathematical formalism to model and
reason about systems. Most analysis tools, however, start from the premises
that models are fully specified, so that any parameters controlling the
system's dynamics must be known exactly. As this is seldom the case, many
methods have been devised over the last decade to infer (learn) such parameters
from observations of the state of the system. In this paper, we depart from
this approach by assuming that our observations are {\it qualitative}
properties encoded as satisfaction of linear temporal logic formulae, as
opposed to quantitative observations of the state of the system. An important
feature of this approach is that it unifies naturally the system identification
and the system design problems, where the properties, instead of observations,
represent requirements to be satisfied. We develop a principled statistical
estimation procedure based on maximising the likelihood of the system's
parameters, using recent ideas from statistical machine learning. We
demonstrate the efficacy and broad applicability of our method on a range of
simple but non-trivial examples, including rumour spreading in social networks
and hybrid models of gene regulation."
"For the design and implementation of engineering systems, performing
model-based analysis can disclose potential safety issues at an early stage.
The analysis of hybrid system models is in general difficult due to the
intrinsic complexity of hybrid dynamics. In this paper, a simulation-based
approach to formal verification of hybrid systems is presented."
"Computer-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have
evolved over the past four decades, from standalone, compartmentalized
operations into networked architectures that communicate across large
distances. There is an emerging trend comprising SCADA and conventional IT
units toward consolidating some overlapping activities. This trend is motivated
by cost savings achieved by consolidating disparate platforms, networks,
software, and maintenance tools. For reasons of efficiency, maintenance,
economics, data acquisition, control platforms have migrated from isolated
in-plant networks using proprietary hardware and software to PC-based systems
using standard software, network protocols, and the Internet. In this thesis,
we present an approach for web-based SCADA systems that adapt to the behavior
of the target application. In addition, we take into account the real time
constraints that imposed by the nature of the problem. We show that our
approach is more efficient than other approaches in terms of consuming as
little as possible of the available resources (computational power and network
bandwidth)."
"Inspired by a concrete industry problem we consider the input synthesis
problem for hybrid systems: given a hybrid system that is subject to input from
outside (also called disturbance or noise), find an input sequence that steers
the system to the desired postcondition. In this paper we focus on sampled data
systems--systems in which a digital controller interrupts a physical plant in a
periodic manner, a class commonly known in control theory--and furthermore
assume that a controller is given in the form of an imperative program. We
develop a structural approach to input synthesis that features forward and
backward reasoning in program logic for the purpose of reducing a search space.
Although the examples we cover are limited both in size and in structure,
experiments with a prototype implementation suggest potential of our program
logic based approach."
"Display cases in supermarket systems often exhibit synchronization, in which
the expansion valves in the display cases turn on and off at exactly the same
time. The study of the influence of switching noise on synchronization in
supermarket refrigeration systems is the subject matter of this work. For this
purpose, we model it as a hybrid system, for which synchronization corresponds
to a periodic trajectory. Subsequently, we investigate the influence of
switching noise. We develop a statistical method for computing an intensity
function, which measures how often the refrigeration system stays synchronized.
By analyzing the intensity, we conclude that the increase in measurement
uncertainty yields the decrease at the prevalence of synchronization."
"This paper considers the gain-scheduled leader-follower tracking control
problem for a parameter varying complex interconnected system with directed
communication topology and uncertain norm-bounded coupling between the agents.
A gain-scheduled consensus-type control protocol is proposed and a sufficient
condition is obtained which guarantees a suboptimal bound on the system
tracking performance under this protocol. An interpolation technique is used to
obtain a protocol schedule which is continuous in the scheduling parameter. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a simulation
example."
"This study presents a method of estimating battery cell core and surface
temperature using a thermal model coupled with electrical impedance
measurement, rather than using direct surface temperature measurements. This is
advantageous over previous methods of estimating temperature from impedance,
which only estimate the average internal temperature. The performance of the
method is demonstrated experimentally on a 2.3 Ah lithium-ion iron phosphate
cell fitted with surface and core thermocouples for validation. An extended
Kalman filter, consisting of a reduced order thermal model coupled with
current, voltage and impedance measurements, is shown to accurately predict
core and surface temperatures for a current excitation profile based on a
vehicle drive cycle. A dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF) based on the same
thermal model and impedance measurement input is capable of estimating the
convection coefficient at the cell surface when the latter is unknown. The
performance of the DEKF using impedance as the measurement input is comparable
to an equivalent dual Kalman filter using a conventional surface temperature
sensor as measurement input."
"This note reveals an explicit relationship between two representative finite
impulse response (FIR) filters, i.e. the newly derived and popularized
Kalman-Like unbiased FIR filter (UFIR) and the receding horizon Kalman FIR
filter (RHKF). It is pointed out that the only difference of the two algorithms
lies in the noise statistics ignorance and appropriate initial condition
construction strategy in UFIR. The revelation can benefit the performance
improvement of one by drawing lessons from the other. Some interesting
conclusions have also been drawn and discussed from this revelation."
"The increasing development of the electric power grid, the largest engineered
system ever, to an even more complicated and larger system requires a new
generation of stability assessment methods that are computationally tractable
and feasible in real-time. In this paper we first extend the recently
introduced Lyapunov Functions Family (LFF) transient stability assessment
approach, that has potential to reduce the computational cost on large scale
power grids, to structure-preserving power grids. Then, we introduce a new
geometry-based method to construct the stability region estimate of power
systems. Our conceptual demonstration shows that this new method can certify
stability of a broader set of initial conditions compared to the
minimization-based LFF method and the energy methods (closest UEP and
controlling UEP methods)."
"Wind is becoming an increasingly significant source of energy in modern power
generation. Amongst existing technologies, Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWT)
equipped with Double Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) is widely deployed.
Consequently, power systems are now experiencing newer power flow patterns and
operating conditions. This paper investigates the impact of a DFIG based Wind
Farm (WF) on the stability of electromechanical oscillations. This is achieved
by performing modal analysis to evaluate the stability of a two-area power
network when subjected to different wind penetration levels and different
geographical installed locations. The approach via eigenvalues analysis
involves the design of voltage and Supplementary Damping Controllers (SDCs)
that contribute to network damping. The effect of Power System Stabilizer (PSS)
is also examined for several network conditions. Simulations demonstrate a
damping improvement up to 933% when the control systems are activated and the
system operates with 25% wind integration."
"The paper presents a new proof of O'Cinneide's characterization theorem. It
is much simpler than the original one and constructive in the sense that we not
only show the existence of a phase type representation, but present a procedure
which creates a phase type representation. We prove that the procedure succeeds
when the conditions of the characterization theorem hold."
"There has been an increasing trend in the electric power system from a
centralized generation-driven grid to a more reliable, environmental friendly,
and customer-driven grid. One of the most important issues which the designers
of smart grids need to deal with is to forecast the fluctuations of power
demand and generation in order to make the power system facilities more
flexible to the variable nature of renewable power resources and demand-side.
This paper proposes a novel two-tier scheme for forecasting the power demand
and generation in a general residential electrical gird which uses the
distributed renewable resources as the primary energy resource. The proposed
forecasting scheme has two tiers: long-term demand/generation forecaster which
is based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and real-time demand/generation
forecaster which is based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA)
model. The paper also shows that how bulk generation improves the adequacy of
proposed residential system by canceling-out the forecasters estimation errors
which are in the form of Gaussian White noises."
"This paper develops efficient algorithms for distributed average consensus
with quantized communication using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). We first study the effects of probabilistic and
deterministic quantizations on a distributed ADMM algorithm. With probabilistic
quantization, this algorithm yields linear convergence to the desired average
in the mean sense with a bounded variance. When deterministic quantization is
employed, the distributed ADMM either converges to a consensus or cycles with a
finite period after a finite-time iteration. In the cyclic case, local
quantized variables have the same mean over one period and hence each node can
also reach a consensus. We then obtain an upper bound on the consensus error
which depends only on the quantization resolution and the average degree of the
network. Finally, we propose a two-stage algorithm which combines both
probabilistic and deterministic quantizations. Simulations show that the
two-stage algorithm, without picking small algorithm parameter, has consensus
errors that are typically less than one quantization resolution for all
connected networks where agents' data can be of arbitrary magnitudes."
"A consensus system is a linear multi-agent system in which agents communicate
to reach a so-called consensus state, defined as the average of the initial
states of the agents. Consider a more generalized situation in which each agent
is given a positive weight and the consensus state is defined as the weighted
average of the initial conditions. We characterize in this paper the weighted
averages that can be evaluated in a decentralized way by agents communicating
over a directed graph. Specifically, we introduce a linear function, called the
objective map, that defines the desired final state as a function of the
initial states of the agents. We then provide a complete answer to the question
of whether there is a decentralized consensus dynamics over a given digraph
which converges to the final state specified by an objective map. In
particular, we characterize not only the set of objective maps that are
feasible for a given digraph, but also the consensus dynamics that implements
the objective map. In addition, we present a decentralized algorithm to design
the consensus dynamics."
"The recently developed labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter uses better
approximations in its update step, compared to the unlabeled multi-Bernoulli
filters, and more importantly, it provides us with not only the estimates for
the number of targets and their states, but also with labels for existing
tracks. This paper presents a novel sensor-control method to be used for
optimal multi-target tracking within the LMB filter. The proposed method uses a
task-driven cost function in which both the state estimation errors and
cardinality estimation errors are taken into consideration. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully guide a mobile sensor in
a challenging multi-target tracking scenario."
"Rigidity theory enables us to specify the conditions of unique localizability
in the cooperative localization problem of wireless sensor networks. This paper
presents a combinatorial rigidity approach to measure (i) generic rigidity and
(ii) generalized redundant rigidity properties of graph structures through
graph invariants for the localization problem in wireless sensor networks. We
define the rigidity index as a graph invariant based on independent set of
edges in the rigidity matroid. It has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates
how close we are to rigidity. Redundant rigidity is required for global
rigidity, which is associated with unique realization of graphs. Moreover,
redundant rigidity also provides rigidity robustness in networked systems
against structural changes, such as link losses. Here, we give a broader
definition of redundant edge that we call the ""generalized redundant edge.""
This definition of redundancy is valid for both rigid and non-rigid graphs.
Next, we define the redundancy index as a graph invariant based on generalized
redundant edges in the rigidity matroid. It also has a value between 0 and 1,
and it indicates the percentage of redundancy in a graph. These two indices
allow us to explore the transition from non-rigidity to rigidity and the
transition from rigidity to redundant rigidity. Examples on graphs are provided
to demonstrate this approach. From a sensor network point of view, these two
indices enable us to evaluate the effects of sensing radii of sensors on the
rigidity properties of networks, which in turn, allow us to examine the
localizability of sensor networks. We evaluate the required changes in sensing
radii for localizability by means of the rigidity index and the redundancy
index using random geometric graphs in simulations."
"Magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) is a practically appealing method for
realizing the near-field wireless power transfer (WPT). The MRC-WPT system with
a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the
literature, while there is limited work on the general setup with multiple
transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint
MRC-WPT system with one transmitter sending power wirelessly to a set of
distributed receivers simultaneously. We derive the power delivered to the load
of each receiver in closed-form expression, and reveal a ""near-far"" fairness
issue in multiuser power transmission due to users' distance-dependent mutual
inductances with the transmitter. We also show that by designing the receivers'
load resistances, the near-far issue can be optimally solved. Specifically, we
propose a centralized algorithm to jointly optimize the load resistances to
minimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter under given
power requirements for the loads. We also devise a distributed algorithm for
the receivers to adjust their load resistances iteratively, for ease of
practical implementation."
"We derive an energy bound for inertial Hegselmann-Krause (HK) systems, which
we define as a variant of the classic HK model in which the agents can change
their weights arbitrarily at each step. We use the bound to prove the
convergence of HK systems with closed-minded agents, which settles a conjecture
of long standing. This paper also introduces anchored HK systems and show their
equivalence to the symmetric heterogeneous model."
"In this paper, the problem of false information injection attack and defense
on state estimation in dynamic multi-sensor systems is investigated from a game
theoretic perspective. The relationship between the Kalman filter and the
adversary can be regarded as a two-person zero-sum game. Under which condition
both sides of the game will reach the Nash equilibrium is investigated in the
paper. The multi-sensor Kalman filter system and the adversary are supposed to
be rational players. The Kalman filter and the adversary have to choose their
respective subsets of sensors to perform system state estimation and false
information injection. It is shown how both sides pick their strategies in
order to gain more and lose less. The optimal solutions are achieved by solving
the minimax problem. Numerical results are also provided in order to illustrate
the effectiveness of the derived optimal strategies."
"In this paper, we propose and study the effectiveness of customer engagement
plans that clearly specify the amount of intervention in customer's load
settings by the grid operator for peak load reduction. We suggest two different
types of plans, including Constant Deviation Plans (CDPs) and Proportional
Deviation Plans (PDPs). We define an adjustable reference temperature for both
CDPs and PDPs to limit the output temperature of each thermostat load and to
control the number of devices eligible to participate in Demand Response
Program (DRP). We model thermostat loads as power throttling devices and design
algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan
parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we
recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable
thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with
similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple
power throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature
deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical
ON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar
amount of peak load reduction. Several other interesting tradeoffs and useful
guidelines for designing mutually beneficial incentives for both the grid
operator and customers can also be identified."
"This paper contains a concise comparison of a number of nonlinear attitude
filtering methods that have attracted attention in the robotics and aviation
literature. With the help of previously published surveys and comparison
studies, the vast literature on the subject is narrowed down to a small pool of
competitive attitude filters. Amongst these filters is a second-order optimal
minimum-energy filter recently proposed by the authors. Easily comparable
discretized unit quaternion implementations of the selected filters are
provided. We conduct a simulation study and compare the transient behaviour and
asymptotic convergence of these filters in two scenarios with different
initialization and measurement errors inspired by applications in unmanned
aerial robotics and space flight. The second-order optimal minimum-energy
filter is shown to have the best performance of all filters, including the
industry standard multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF)."
"This paper considers the leader-follower tracking control problem for linear
interconnected systems with undirected topology and linear dynamic coupling.
Interactions between the systems are treated as linear dynamic uncertainty and
are described in terms of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A
consensus-type tracking control protocol is proposed for each system based on
its state relative its neighbors. In addition a selected set of subsystems uses
for control their relative states with respect to the leader. Two methods are
proposed for the design of this control protocol. One method uses a coordinate
transformation to recast the protocol design problem as a decentralized robust
control problem for an auxiliary interconnected large scale system. Another
method is direct, it does not employ coordinate transformation; it also allows
for more general linear uncertain interactions. Using these methods, sufficient
conditions are obtained which guarantee that the system tracks the leader.
These conditions guarantee a suboptimal bound on the system consensus and
tracking performance. The proposed methods are compared using a simulation
example, and their effectiveness is discussed. Also, algorithms are proposed
for computing suboptimal controllers."
"The class of radial fuzzy systems is introduced. The fuzzy systems in this
class use radial functions to implement membership functions of fuzzy sets and
exhibit a shape preservation property in antecedents of their rules. The
property is called the radial property. It enables the radial fuzzy systems to
have their computational model mathematically tractable under both conjunctive
and implicative representations of their rule bases. Coherence of radial
implicative fuzzy systems is discussed and a sufficient condition for coherence
is stated."
"This paper proposes a general framework for probabilistic certification of
cancer therapies. The certification is defined in terms of two key issues which
are the tumor contraction and the lower admissible bound on the circulating
lymphocytes which is viewed as indicator of the patient health. The
certification is viewed as the ability to guarantee with a predefined high
probability the success of the therapy over a finite horizon despite of the
unavoidable high uncertainties affecting the dynamic model that is used to
compute the optimal scheduling of drugs injection. The certification paradigm
can be viewed as a tool for tuning the treatment parameters and protocols as
well as for getting a rational use of limited or expensive drugs. The proposed
framework is illustrated using the specific problem of combined
immunotherapy/chemotherapy of cancer."
"The kinetic battery model is a popular model of the dynamic behavior of a
conventional battery, useful to predict or optimize the time until battery
depletion. The model however lacks certain obvious aspects of batteries
in-the-wild, especially with respect to (i) the effects of random influences
and (ii) the behavior when charging up to capacity bounds. This paper considers
the kinetic battery model with bounded capacity in the context of piecewise
constant yet random charging and discharging. The resulting model enables the
time-dependent evaluation of the risk of battery depletion. This is exemplified
in a power dependability study of a nano satellite mission."
"Technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is getting mature and many AVs will
appear on the roads in the near future. AVs become connected with the support
of various vehicular communication technologies and they possess high degree of
control to respond to instantaneous situations cooperatively with high
efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a new public
transportation system based on AVs. It manages a fleet of AVs to accommodate
transportation requests, offering point-to-point services with ride sharing. We
focus on the two major problems of the system: scheduling and admission
control. The former is to configure the most economical schedules and routes
for the AVs to satisfy the admissible requests while the latter is to determine
the set of admissible requests among all requests to produce maximum profit.
The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and the
admission control problem is cast as a bilevel optimization, which embeds the
scheduling problem as the major constraint. By utilizing the analytical
properties of the problem, we develop an effective genetic-algorithm-based
method to tackle the admission control problem. We validate the performance of
the algorithm with real-world transportation service data."
"This paper considers the cluster synchronization problem of generic linear
dynamical systems whose system models are distinct in different clusters. These
nonidentical linear models render control design and coupling conditions highly
correlated if static couplings are used for all individual systems. In this
paper, a dynamic coupling structure, which incorporates a global weighting
factor and a vanishing auxiliary control variable, is proposed for each agent
and is shown to be a feasible solution. Lower bounds on the global and local
weighting factors are derived under the condition that every interaction
subgraph associated with each cluster admits a directed spanning tree. The
spanning tree requirement is further shown to be a necessary condition when the
clusters connect acyclicly with each other. Simulations for two applications,
cluster heading alignment of nonidentical ships and cluster phase
synchronization of nonidentical harmonic oscillators, illustrate essential
parts of the derived theoretical results."
"This paper presents a data-driven receding horizon fault estimation method
for additive actuator and sensor faults in unknown linear time-invariant
systems, with enhanced robustness to stochastic identification errors.
State-of-the-art methods construct fault estimators with identified state-space
models or Markov parameters, but they do not compensate for identification
errors. Motivated by this limitation, we first propose a receding horizon fault
estimator parameterized by predictor Markov parameters. This estimator provides
(asymptotically) unbiased fault estimates as long as the subsystem from faults
to outputs has no unstable transmission zeros. When the identified Markov
parameters are used to construct the above fault estimator, zero-mean
stochastic identification errors appear as model uncertainty multiplied with
unknown fault signals and online system inputs/outputs (I/O). Based on this
fault estimation error analysis, we formulate a mixed-norm problem for the
offline robust design that regards online I/O data as unknown. An alternative
online mixed-norm problem is also proposed that can further reduce estimation
errors when the online I/O data have large amplitudes, at the cost of increased
computational burden. Based on a geometrical interpretation of the two proposed
mixed-norm problems, systematic methods to tune the user-defined parameters
therein are given to achieve desired performance trade-offs. Simulation
examples illustrate the benefits of our proposed methods compared to recent
literature."
"This paper proposes to decouple performance optimization and enforcement of
asymptotic convergence in Model Predictive Control (MPC) so that convergence to
a given terminal set is achieved independently of how much performance is
optimized at each sampling step. By embedding an explicit decreasing condition
in the MPC constraints and thanks to a novel and very easy-to-implement convex
feasibility solver proposed in the paper, it is possible to run an outer
performance optimization algorithm on top of the feasibility solver and
optimize for an amount of time that depends on the available CPU resources
within the current sampling step (possibly going open-loop at a given sampling
step in the extreme case no resources are available) and still guarantee
convergence to the terminal set. While the MPC setup and the solver proposed in
the paper can deal with quite general classes of functions, we highlight the
synthesis method and show numerical results in case of linear MPC and
ellipsoidal and polyhedral terminal sets."
"The purpose of this report is to define abstractions for multi-agent systems
under coupled constraints. In the proposed decentralized framework, we specify
a finite or countable transition system for each agent which only takes into
account the discrete positions of its neighbors. The dynamics of the considered
systems consist of two components. An appropriate feedback law which guarantees
that certain performance requirements (eg. connectivity) are preserved and
induces the coupled constraints and additional free inputs which we exploit in
order to accomplish high level tasks. In this work we provide sufficient
conditions on the space and time discretization of the system which ensure that
we can extract a well posed and hence meaningful finite transition system."
"In this paper, we consider a nonlinear networked control system (NCS) in
which controllers, sensors and actuators are connected via several
communication links. In each link, networking effects such as the transmission
delay, packet loss, sampling jitter and data packet miss-ordering are captured
by time-varying delays. Stability analysis is carried out based on the Lyapunov
Krasovskii method to obtain a condition for stability of the nonlinear NCS in
the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI). The results are applied to a two
degrees of freedom robot arm NCS which shows a considerable improvement with
respect to the previous works."
"This paper presents a mathematical approach for improving the performance of
a control system by modifying the time delay at certain operating conditions.
This approach converts a continuous time loop into a discrete time loop. The
formula derived is applied successfully to an applicable control system. The
results show that the proposed approach efficiently improves the control system
performance. The relation between the sampling time and the time delay is
obtained. Two different operating conditions are examined to assess the
proposed approach in improving the performance of the control system."
"The primal problem with Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for smart cities
is the lack of interoperability at various levels, and more predominately at
the device level. While there exist multitude of platforms from multiple
manufacturers, the existing ecosystem still remains highly closed. In this
paper, we propose SNaaS or Sensor/Network as a Service: a service layer that
enables the creation of the plug-n-play infrastructure, across platforms from
multiple vendors, necessary for interoperability and successful deployment of
large-scale city wide systems. In order to correctly position the new service
layer, we present a high level reference IoT architecture for smart city
implementations, and follow it up with the workflow details of SNaaS along with
preliminary microbenchmarks."
"In this paper, we use data collected from over 2000 non-residential electric
vehicle supply equipments (EVSEs) located in Northern California for the year
of 2013 to estimate the potential benefits of smart electric vehicle (EV)
charging. We develop a smart charging framework to identify the benefits of
non-residential EV charging to the load aggregators and the distribution grid.
Using this extensive dataset, we aim to improve upon past studies focusing on
the benefits of smart EV charging by relaxing the assumptions made in these
studies regarding: (i) driving patterns, driver behavior and driver types; (ii)
the scalability of a limited number of simulated vehicles to represent
different load aggregation points in the power system with different customer
characteristics; and (iii) the charging profile of EVs. First, we study the
benefits of EV aggregations behind-the-meter, where a time-of-use pricing
schema is used to understand the benefits to the owner when EV aggregations
shift load from high cost periods to lower cost periods. For the year of 2013,
we show a reduction of up to 24.8% in the monthly bill is possible. Then,
following a similar aggregation strategy, we show that EV aggregations decrease
their contribution to the system peak load by approximately 40% when charging
is controlled within arrival and departure times. Our results also show that it
could be expected to shift approximately 0.25kWh (~2.8%) of energy per
non-residential EV charging session from peak periods (12PM-6PM) to off-peak
periods (after 6PM) in Northern California for the year of 2013."
"In this paper, we propose two novel p-norm penalty least mean square (Lp-LMS)
algorithms as supplements of the conventional Lp-LMS algorithm established for
sparse adaptive filtering recently. A gradient comparator is employed to
selectively apply the zero attractor of p-norm constraint for only those taps
that have the same polarity as that of the gradient of the squared
instantaneous error, which leads to the new proposed gradient compared p-norm
constraint LMS algorithm (LpGC-LMS). We explain that the LpGC-LMS can achieve
lower mean square error than the standard Lp-LMS algorithm theoretically and
experimentally. To further improve the performance of the filter, the LpNGC-LMS
algorithm is derived using a new gradient comparator which takes the
sign-smoothed version of the previous one. The performance of the LpNGC-LMS is
superior to that of the LpGC-LMS in theory and in simulations. Moreover, these
two comparators can be easily applied to other norm constraint LMS algorithms
to derive some new approaches for sparse adaptive filtering. The numerical
simulation results show that the two proposed algorithms achieve better
performance than the standard LMS algorithm and Lp-LMS algorithm in terms of
convergence rate and steady-state behavior in sparse system identification
settings."
"It is known that polynomial filtering can accelerate the convergence towards
average consensus on an undirected network. In this paper the gain of a
second-order filtering is investigated. A set of graphs is determined for which
consensus can be attained in finite time, and a preconditioner is proposed to
adapt the undirected weights of any given graph to achieve fastest convergence
with the polynomial filter. The corresponding cost function differs from the
traditional spectral gap, as it favors grouping the eigenvalues in two
clusters. A possible loss of robustness of the polynomial filter is also
highlighted."
"This paper proposes a new leaky least mean square (leaky LMS, LLMS) algorithm
in which a norm penalty is introduced to force the solution to be sparse in the
application of system identification. The leaky LMS algorithm is derived
because the performance ofthe standard LMS algorithm deteriorates when the
input is highly correlated. However, both ofthem do not take the sparsity
information into account to yield better behaviors. As a modification ofthe
LLMS algorithm, the proposed algorithm, named Lp-LLMS, incorporates a p norm
penalty into the cost function ofthe LLMS to obtain a shrinkage in the weight
update equation, which then enhances the performance of the filter in system
identification settings, especially when the impulse response is sparse. The
simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm improves the performance
ofthe filter in sparse system settings in the presence ofnoisy input signals."
"In this paper, we propose a novel leaky least mean square (leaky LMS, LLMS)
algorithm which employs a p-norm-like constraint to force the solution to be
sparse in the application of system identification. As an extension of the LMS
algorithm which is the most widely-used adaptive filtering technique, the LLMS
algorithm has been proposed for decades, due to the deteriorated performance of
the standard LMS algorithm with highly correlated input. However, both ofthem
do not consider the sparsity information to have better behaviors. As a
sparse-aware modification of the LLMS, our proposed Lplike-LLMS algorithm,
incorporates a p-norm-like penalty into the cost function of the LLMS to obtain
a shrinkage in the weight update, which then enhances the performance in sparse
system identification settings. The simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm improves the performance of the filter in sparse system settings in
the presence of noisy input signals."
"Diversity of software packages to simulate the power system circuits is
considerable. It is challenging to transfer power system circuit model data
(PSCMD) among different software tools and rebuild the same circuit in the
second software environment. This paper proposes a unified platform (UP) where
PSCMD are stored in a spreadsheet file with a defined format. Script-based
PSCMD transfer applications, written in MATLAB, have been developed for a set
of software to read the circuit model data from the UP spreadsheet and
reconstruct the circuit in the destination software. This significantly eases
the process of transferring circuit model data between each pair of software
tools. In this paper ETAP, OpenDSS, Grid LabD, and DEW are considered. In order
to test the developed PSCMD transfer applications, circuit model data of a test
circuit and an actual sample circuit from a Californian utility company, both
built in CYME, were exported into the spreadsheet file according to the UP
format. Thereafter, circuit model data were imported successfully from the
spreadsheet files into all above mentioned software using the PSCMD transfer
applications developed for each software individually. Finally, load flow
analysis is performed in all software and the obtained results match with each
other."
"When multiple model predictive controllers are implemented on a shared
control area network (CAN), their performance may degrade due to the
inhomogeneous timing and delays among messages. The priority based real-time
scheduling of messages on the CAN introduces complex timing of events,
especially when the types and number of messages change at runtime. This paper
introduces a novel hybrid timing model to make runtime predictions on the
timing of the messages for a finite time window. Controllers can be designed
using the optimization algorithms for model predictive control by considering
the timing as optimization constraints. This timing model allows multiple
controllers to share a CAN without significant degradation in the controller
performance. The timing model also provides a convenient way to check the
schedulability of messages on the CAN at runtime. Simulation results
demonstrate that the timing model is accurate and computationally efficient to
meet the needs of real-time implementation. Simulation results also demonstrate
that model predictive controllers designed when considering the timing
constraints have superior performance than the controllers designed without
considering the timing constraints."
"This paper deals with the problem of control of partially known nonlinear
systems, which have an open-loop stable equilibrium, but we would like to add a
PI controller to regulate its behavior around another operating point. Our main
contribution is the identification of a class of systems for which a globally
stable PI can be designed knowing only the systems input matrix and measuring
only the actuated coordinates. The construction of the PI is done invoking
passivity theory. The difficulties encountered in the design of adaptive PI
controllers with the existing theoretical tools are also discussed. As an
illustration of the theory, we consider port--Hamiltonian systems and a class
of thermal processes."
"In this paper, we investigate the stabilization of a nonlinear plant subject
to network constraints, under the assumption of partial knowledge of the plant
state. The event triggered paradigm is used for the observation and the control
of the system. Necessary conditions, making use of the ISS property, are given
to guarantee the existence of a triggering mechanism, leading to asymptotic
convergence of the observer and system states. The proposed triggering
mechanism is illustrated in the stabilization of a robot with a flexible link
robot."
"The problem of quickest change detection with communication rate constraints
is studied. A network of wireless sensors with limited computation capability
monitors the environment and sends observations to a fusion center via wireless
channels. At an unknown time instant, the distributions of observations at all
the sensor nodes change simultaneously. Due to limited energy, the sensors
cannot transmit at all the time instants. The objective is to detect the change
at the fusion center as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on false
detection and average communication rate between the sensors and the fusion
center. A minimax formulation is proposed. The cumulative sum (CuSum) algorithm
is used at the fusion center and censoring strategies are used at the sensor
nodes. The censoring strategies, which are adaptive to the CuSum statistic, are
fed back by the fusion center. The sensors only send observations that fall
into prescribed sets to the fusion center. This CuSum adaptive censoring
(CuSum-AC) algorithm is proved to be an equalizer rule and to be globally
asymptotically optimal for any positive communication rate constraint, as the
average run length to false alarm goes to infinity. It is also shown, by
numerical examples, that the CuSum-AC algorithm provides a suitable trade-off
between the detection performance and the communication rate."
"In this paper, least square estimation (LSE)-based dynamic generator model
parameter identification is investigated. Electromechanical dynamics related
parameters such as inertia constant and primary frequency control droop for a
synchronous generator are estimated using Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data
obtained at the generator terminal bus. The key idea of applying LSE for
dynamic parameter estimation is to have a discrete
\underline{a}uto\underline{r}egression with e\underline{x}ogenous input (ARX)
model. With an ARX model, a linear estimation problem can be formulated and the
parameters of the ARX model can be found. This paper gives the detailed
derivation of converting a generator model with primary frequency control into
an ARX model. The generator parameters will be recovered from the estimated ARX
model parameters afterwards. Two types of conversion methods are presented:
zero-order hold (ZOH) method and Tustin method. Numerical results are presented
to illustrate the proposed LSE application in dynamic system parameter
identification using PMU data."
"Unnecessary communication and computation in the periodic execution of
control tasks lead to over-provisioning in hardware design (or
underexploitation in hardware utilization) in control applications, such as
networked control systems. To address these issues, researchers have proposed a
new class of strategies, named event-driven strategies. Despite of their
beneficiary effects, matters like task scheduling and appropriate dimensioning
of communication components have become more complicated with respect to
traditional periodic strategies. In this paper, we present a formal approach to
derive an abstracted system that captures the sampling behavior of a family of
event-triggered strategies for the case of LTI systems. This structure
approximately simulates the sampling behavior of the aperiodic control system.
Furthermore, the resulting quotient system is equivalent to a timed automaton.
In the construction of the abstraction, the state space is confined to a finite
number of convex regions, each of which represents a mode in the quotient
system. An LMI-based technique is deployed to derive a sampling time interval
associated to each region. Finally, reachability analysis is leveraged to find
the transitions of the quotient system."
"For an uncontrollable system, adding leaders and adjusting edge weights are
two methods to improve controllability. In this paper, controllability of
multi-agent systems under directed topologies is studied, especially on leader
selection problem and weight adjustment problem. For a given system, necessary
and sufficient algebraic conditions for controllability with fewest leaders are
proposed. From another perspective, when leaders are fixed, controllability
could be improved by adjusting edge weights, and therefore the system is
supposed to be structurally controllable, which holds if and only if the
communication topology contains a spanning tree. It is also proved that the
number of fewest edges needed to be assigned on new weights equals the rank
deficiency of controllability matrix. An algorithm on how to perform weight
adjustment is presented. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the
theoretical results."
"We propose a new decentralized control scheme for DC Islanded microGrids
(ImGs) composed by several Distributed Generation Units (DGUs) with a general
interconnection topology. Each local controller regulates to a reference value
the voltage of the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) of the corresponding DGU.
Notably, off-line control design is conducted in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion
meaning that (i) the possibility of adding/removing a DGU without spoiling
stability of the overall ImG is checked through an optimization problem; (ii)
when a DGU is plugged in or out at most neighbouring DGUs have to update their
controllers and (iii) the synthesis of a local controller uses only information
on the corresponding DGU and lines connected to it. This guarantee total
scalability of control synthesis as the ImG size grows or DGU gets replaced.
Yes, under mild approximations of line dynamics, we formally guarantee
stability of the overall closed-loop ImG. The performance of the proposed
controllers is analyzed simulating different scenarios in PSCAD."
"In this paper, we address the global stabilization of chains of integrators
by means of a bounded static feedback law whose p first time derivatives are
bounded. Our construction is based on the technique of nested saturations
introduced by Teel. We show that the control amplitude and the maximum value of
its p first derivatives can be imposed below any prescribed values. Our results
are illustrated by the stabilization of the third order integrator on the
feedback and its first two derivatives."
"This paper, as a continuing work of [1], focus on establishing the fact that
if we equip a reciprocal multi-agent (RMA) system with a triangulated Laman
graph (TLG), then the associated potential function is generically an
equivariant Morse function, i.e, there are only finitely many critical orbits
each of which is nondegenerate. Though this assumption on the potential
function of being an equivariant Morse function has been used, and in fact
indispensable, in several occasions. But it is actually still an open question
whether it is true for a given RMA system. Thus, in this paper we will provide
a confirmative answer to the question for the class of RMA systems with TLGs.
The main result, as well as the analysis of this paper, has many implications
for other difficult problems."
"This paper considers the consensus problem for a network of nodes with random
interactions and sampled-data control actions. We first show that consensus in
expectation, in mean square, and almost surely are equivalent for a general
random network model when the inter-sampling interval and network size satisfy
a simple relation. The three types of consensus are shown to be simultaneously
achieved over an independent or a Markovian random network defined on an
underlying graph with a directed spanning tree. For both independent and
Markovian random network models, necessary and sufficient conditions for
mean-square consensus are derived in terms of the spectral radius of the
corresponding state transition matrix. These conditions are then interpreted as
the existence of critical value on the inter-sampling interval, below which
global mean-square consensus is achieved and above which the system diverges in
mean-square sense for some initial states. Finally, we establish an upper bound
on the inter-sampling interval below which almost sure consensus is reached,
and a lower bound on the inter-sampling interval above which almost sure
divergence is reached. Some numerical simulations are given to validate the
theoretical results and some discussions on the critical value of the
inter-sampling intervals for the mean-square consensus are provided."
"The optimal power-flow problem (OPF) has played a key role in the planning
and operation of power systems. Due to the non-linear nature of the AC
power-flow equations, the OPF problem is known to be non-convex, therefore hard
to solve. Most proposed methods for solving the OPF rely on approximations that
render the problem convex, but that may yield inexact solutions. Recently,
Farivar and Low proposed a method that is claimed to be exact for radial
distribution systems, despite no apparent approximations. In our work, we show
that it is, in fact, not exact. On one hand, there is a misinterpretation of
the physical network model related to the ampacity constraint of the lines'
current flows. On the other hand, the proof of the exactness of the proposed
relaxation requires unrealistic assumptions related to the unboundedness of
specific control variables. We also show that the extension of this approach to
account for exact line models might provide physically infeasible solutions.
Recently, several contributions have proposed OPF algorithms that rely on the
use of the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, as we
show in this work, there are cases for which the ADMM-based solution of the
non-relaxed OPF problem fails to converge. To overcome the aforementioned
limitations, we propose an algorithm for the solution of a non-approximated,
non-convex OPF problem in radial distribution systems that is based on the
method of multipliers, and on a primal decomposition of the OPF. This work is
divided in two parts. In Part I, we specifically discuss the limitations of BFM
and ADMM to solve the OPF problem. In Part II, we provide a centralized version
and a distributed asynchronous version of the proposed OPF algorithm and we
evaluate its performances using both small-scale electrical networks, as well
as a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder."
"Event-triggered networked control of a linear dynamical system is
investigated. Specifically, the dynamical system and the controller are assumed
to be connected through a communication channel. State and control input
information packets between the system and the controller are attempted to be
exchanged over the network only at time instants when certain triggering
conditions are satisfied. We provide a probabilistic characterization for the
link failures which allows us to model random packet losses due to
unreliability in transmissions as well as those caused by malicious jamming
attacks. We obtain conditions for the almost sure stability of the closed-loop
system, and we illustrate the efficacy of our approach with a numerical
example."
"In this paper we use SOS and SDP to design output feedback controllers for a
class of one-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations with point
measurements and point actuation. Our approach is based on the use of SOS to
search for positive quadratic Lyapunov functions, controllers and observers.
These Lyapunov functions, controllers and observers are parameterized by linear
operators which are defined by SOS polynomials. The main result of the paper is
the development of an improved class of observer-based controllers and evidence
which indicates that when the system is controllable and observable, these
methods will find a observer-based controller for sufficiently high polynomial
degree (similar to well-known results from backstepping)."
"In this paper, we address a collection of state space reachability problems,
for linear time-invariant systems, using a minimal number of actuators. In
particular, we design a zero-one diagonal input matrix B, with a minimal number
of non-zero entries, so that a specified state vector is reachable from a given
initial state. Moreover, we design a B so that a system can be steered either
into a given subspace, or sufficiently close to a desired state. This work
extends the recent results of Olshevsky and Pequito, where a zero-one diagonal
or column matrix B is constructed so that the involved system is controllable.
Specifically, we prove that the first two of our aforementioned problems are
NP-hard; these results hold for a zero-one column matrix B as well. Then, we
provide efficient polynomial time algorithms for their general solution, along
with their worst case approximation guarantees. Finally, we illustrate their
performance over large random networks."
"In this report we provide a decentralized robust control approach, which
guarantees that connectivity of a multi-agent network is maintained when
certain bounded input terms are added to the control strategy. Our main
motivation for this framework is to determine abstractions for multi-agent
systems under coupled constraints which are further exploited for high level
plan generation."
"We consider sensor transmission power control for state estimation, using a
Bayesian inference approach. A sensor node sends its local state estimate to a
remote estimator over an unreliable wireless communication channel with random
data packet drops. As related to packet dropout rate, transmission power is
chosen by the sensor based on the relative importance of the local state
estimate. The proposed power controller is proved to preserve Gaussianity of
local estimate innovation, which enables us to obtain a closed-form solution of
the expected state estimation error covariance. Comparisons with alternative
non data-driven controllers demonstrate performance improvement using our
approach."
"Optimal control synthesis in stochastic systems with respect to quantitative
temporal logic constraints can be formulated as linear programming problems.
However, centralized synthesis algorithms do not scale to many practical
systems. To tackle this issue, we propose a decomposition-based distributed
synthesis algorithm. By decomposing a large-scale stochastic system modeled as
a Markov decision process into a collection of interacting sub-systems, the
original control problem is formulated as a linear programming problem with a
sparse constraint matrix, which can be solved through distributed optimization
methods. Additionally, we propose a decomposition algorithm which automatically
exploits, if exists, the modular structure in a given large-scale system. We
illustrate the proposed methods through robotic motion planning examples."
"This paper studies an optimal control problem for continuous-time stochastic
systems subject to reachability objectives specified in a subclass of metric
interval temporal logic specifications, a temporal logic with real-time
constraints. We propose a probabilistic method for synthesizing an optimal
control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a specification
based on a discrete approximation of the underlying stochastic system. First,
we show that the original problem can be formulated as a stochastic optimal
control problem in a state space augmented with finite memory and states of
some clock variables. Second, we present a numerical method for computing an
optimal policy with which the given specification is satisfied with the maximal
probability in point-based semantics in the discrete approximation of the
underlying system. We show that the policy obtained in the discrete
approximation converges to the optimal one for satisfying the specification in
the continuous or dense-time semantics as the discretization becomes finer in
both state and time. Finally, we illustrate our approach with a robotic motion
planning example."
"We present a topology detection method combining smart meter sensor
information and sparse line measurements. The problem is formulated as a
spanning tree identification problem over a graph given partial nodal and edge
power flow information. In the deterministic case of known nodal power
consumption and edge power flow we provide sensor placement criterion which
guarantees correct identification of all spanning trees. We then present a
detection method which is polynomial in complexity to the size of the graph. In
the stochastic case where loads are given by forecasts derived from delayed
smart meter data, we provide a combinatorial complexity MAP detector and a
polynomial complexity approximate MAP detector which is shown to work near
optimum in all numerical cases."
"Recently, there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) for civilian operations such as package delivery, firefighting, and fast
disaster response. As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed to
support potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, in
order to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under which
these requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller for
meeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability is
only tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers is
unrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in a
single-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modes
corresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowed
maneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose several
liveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller,
also based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers. For a single
altitude range, our approach guarantees safety for one safety breach; in the
unlikely event of multiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over
multiple altitude ranges. We demonstrate the satisfaction of liveness and
safety requirements through simulations of three common scenarios."
"This paper deals with the problem of trajectory tracking of a class of
bilinear systems with time--varying measurable disturbance. A set of matrices
{A,B_i} has been identified, via a linear matrix inequality, for which it is
possible to ensure global tracking of (admissible, differentiable) trajectories
with a simple linear time--varying PI controller. Instrumental to establish the
result is the construction of an output signal with respect to which the
incremental model is passive. The result is applied to the boost and the
modular multilevel converter for which experimental results are given."
"This letter proposes an analytical approach to formulate the power system
oscillation frequency under a large disturbance. A fact is revealed that the
oscillation frequency is only the function of the oscillation amplitude when
the system's model and operating condition are fixed. Case studies also show
that this function is damping-insensitive and could be applied to an inter-area
model of a multi-machine power system."
"This paper addresses the problem of estimating the position of an object
moving in $R^n$ from direction and velocity measurements. After addressing
observability issues associated with this problem, a nonlinear observer is
designed so as to encompass the case where the measured velocity is corrupted
by a constant bias. Global exponential convergence of the estimation error is
proved under a condition of persistent excitation upon the direction
measurements. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the observer."
"In this article, we propose a design method of selfinterference cancelers for
wireless relay stations taking account of the baseband signal subspace. The
problem is first formulated as a sampled-data $H^{\infty}$ control problem with
a generalized sampler and a generalized hold, which can be reduced to a
discretetime $\ell^2$-induced norm minimization problem. Taking account of the
implementation of the generalized sampler and hold, we adopt the filter-sampler
structure for the generalized sampler, and the uspampler-filter-hold structure
for the generalized hold. Under these implementation constraints, we
reformulate the problem as a standard discrete-time $H^{\infty}$ control
problem by using the discrete-time lifting technique. A simulation result is
shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"A comprehensive review of the literature on manoeuvring target tracking for
both uncluttered and cluttered measurements is presented. Various discrete-time
dynamical models including non-random input, random-input and switching or
hybrid system manoeuvre models are presented. The problem of manoeuvre
detection is covered. Classical and current filtering methods for manoeuvre
tracking are presented including multi-level process noise, input estimation,
variable dimension filtering, two-stage filter, the interacting multiple model
algorithm, and generalised pseudo-Bayesian algorithms. Various extensions of
these algorithms to the case of cluttered measurements are also described and
these include: joint manoeuvre and measurement association, probabilistic data
association and multi-hypothesis tracking. Smoothing schemes, including IMM
smoothing and batch expectation-maximisation using the Viterbi algorithm, are
also described. The use of amplitude information for target measurement
discrimination is discussed. It is noted that although many manoeuvre tacking
techniques exist, the literature contains surprisingly few performance
comparisons to guide the design engineer although a performance benchmark has
recently been introduced."
"In this paper, a new polynomial chaos based framework for analyzing linear
systems with probabilistic parameters is presented. Stability analysis and
synthesis of optimal quadratically stabilizing controllers for such systems are
presented as convex optimization problems, with exponential mean square
stability guarantees. A Monte-Carlo approach for analysis and synthesis is also
presented, which is used to benchmark the polynomial chaos based approach. The
computational advantage of the polynomial chaos approach is shown with an
example based on the design of an optimal EMS-stabilizing controller, for an
F-16 aircraft model."
"Here we use polynomial chaos framework to design controllers for linear
parameter varying (LPV) dynamical systems. We assume the scheduling variable to
be random and use polynomial chaos approach to synthesize the controller for
the resulting linear stochastic dynamical system. The stability of the LPV
system is formulated as an exponential mean-square (EMS) stability problem. Two
algorithms are presented that guarantee EMS stability of the stochastic system
and correspond to parameter dependent and independent Lyapunov functions,
respectively. LPV controllers from the polynomial chaos based framework is
shown to outperform LPV controller from classical design for an example
nonlinear system."
"A nonlinear frequency response based adaptive vibration controller is
proposed for a class of nonlinear mechanical systems. In order to obtain the
nonlinear Frequency Response Function (FRF), the convergence properties of the
system are studied by using the convergence (contraction) theory. If the system
under consideration is: 1) convergent, it directly enables to derive a
nonlinear FRF for a band of excitation inputs, 2) non-convergent, first a
controller is used to obtain the convergence and then the corresponding FRF for
a band of excitation inputs is derived. Now the gains of the proposed adaptive
controller are tuned such that a desired closed-loop frequency response, in the
presence of excitation inputs is achieved. Finally, a building structure with
nonlinear cubic stiffness and a satellite system are considered to illustrate
the theoretical results."
"An outage detection framework for power distribution networks is proposed.
Given the tree structure of the distribution system, a method is developed
combining the use of real-time power flow measurements on edges of the tree
with load forecasts at the nodes of the tree. A maximum a posteriori detector
{\color{black} (MAP)} is formulated for arbitrary number and location of
outages on trees which is shown to have an efficient detector. A framework
relying on the maximum missed detection probability is used for optimal sensor
placement and is solved for tree networks. Finally, a set of case studies is
considered using feeder data from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.
We show that a 10\% loss in mean detection reliability network wide reduces the
required sensor density by 60 \% for a typical feeder if efficient use of
measurements is performed."
"The present article introduces a reference framework for discussing
resilience of computational systems. Rather than a property that may or may not
be exhibited by a system, resilience is interpreted here as the emerging result
of a dynamic process. Said process represents the dynamic interplay between the
behaviors exercised by a system and those of the environment it is set to
operate in. As a result of this interpretation, coherent definitions of several
aspects of resilience can be derived and proposed, including elasticity, change
tolerance, and antifragility. Definitions are also provided for measures of the
risk of unresilience as well as for the optimal match of a given resilient
design with respect to the current environmental conditions. Finally, a
resilience strategy based on our model is exemplified through a simple
scenario."
"This paper studies the distributed control and estimation of multi-agent
systems based on bearing information. In particular, we consider two problems:
(i) the distributed control of bearing-constrained formations using relative
position measurements and (ii) the distributed localization of sensor networks
using bearing measurements. Both of the two problems are considered in
arbitrary dimensional spaces. The analyses of the two problems rely on the
recently developed bearing rigidity theory. We show that the two problems have
the same mathematical formulation and can be solved by identical protocols. The
proposed controller and estimator can globally solve the two problems without
ambiguity. The results are supported with illustrative simulations."
"This paper presents a general form of integral sliding mode manifold, and
proposes an algorithmic approach based on Sum of Squares (SOS) programming to
design generalized integral sliding mode manifold and controller for nonlinear
systems with both matched and unmatched uncertainties. The approach also gives
a sufficient condition for successful design of controller and manifold
parameters. The result of the paper is then verified by several simulation
examples and two practical applications, namely Glucose-insulin regulation
problem and the unicycle dynamics steering problem are considered."
"Two types of privacy-preserving decision making paradigms for
utility-community interactions for multi-horizon operation are examined in this
paper. In both designs, communities with renewable energy sources, distributed
generators, and energy storage systems minimize their costs with limited
information exchange with the utility. The utility makes decision based on the
information provided from the communities. Through an iterative process, all
parties achieve agreement. The authors' previous research results on
subgradient and lower-upper-bound switching (LUBS)-based distributed
optimization oriented multi-agent control strategies are examined and the
convergence analysis of both strategies are provided. The corresponding
decision making architectures, including information flow among agents and
learning (or iteration) procedure, are developed for multi-horizon decision
making scenarios. Numerical results illustrate the decision making procedures
and demonstrate their feasibility of practical implementation. The two decision
making architectures are compared for their implementation requirements as well
as performance."
"This paper proposes a data-driven approach to detect the switching actions
and topology transitions in distribution networks. It is based on the real time
analysis of time-series voltages measurements. The analysis approach draws on
data from high-precision phasor measurement units ($\mu$PMUs or synchrophasors)
for distribution networks. The key fact is that time-series measurement data
taken from the distribution network has specific patterns representing state
transitions such as topology changes. The proposed algorithm is based on
comparison of actual voltage measurements with a library of signatures derived
from the possible topologies simulation. The IEEE 33-bus model is used for the
algorithm validation."
"In this paper, we develop a \textit{distributed} algorithm to localize an
arbitrary number of agents moving in a bounded region of interest. We assume
that the network contains \textit{at least one} agent with known location
(hereinafter referred to as an anchor), and each agent measures a noisy version
of its motion and the distances to the nearby agents. We provide
a~\emph{geometric approach}, which allows each agent to: (i) continually update
the distances to the locations where it has exchanged information with the
other nodes in the past; and (ii) measure the distance between a neighbor and
any such locations. Based on this approach, we provide a \emph{linear update}
to find the locations of an arbitrary number of mobile agents when they follow
some convexity in their deployment and motion.
  Since the agents are mobile, they may not be able to find nearby nodes
(agents and/or anchors) to implement a distributed algorithm. To address this
issue, we introduce the notion of a \emph{virtual convex hull} with the help of
the aforementioned geometric approach. In particular, each agent keeps track of
a virtual convex hull of other nodes, which may not physically exist, and
updates its location with respect to its neighbors in the virtual hull. We show
that the corresponding localization algorithm, in the absence of noise, can be
abstracted as a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) system, with non-deterministic system
matrices, which asymptotically tracks the true locations of the agents. We
provide simulations to verify the analytical results and evaluate the
performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise on the motion as well as
on the distance measurements."
"Oscillations between swing modes of electric machines is an important
limitation in achieving a high level of transient performance and reliability
in power grids. Based on the new advances in measurement and transmission of
wide-area information, this work proposes a distributed networked control
scheme by considering the communication delays. The results are applied to
reduce the inter-area swing oscillations in a power grid. In comparison with
the previous works, we provide a more realistic modeling of the resulting
networked control system with data sampling and delays. The exactness of the
proposed modeling allows for precise evaluation and comparison between the
distributed and decentralized schema. A symmetric a dual machine power system
is highly oscillatory and we focus on this case to evaluate the ability of the
proposed control design in dampening of the oscillations. The design can be
done either based on optimization of a quadratic cost function or a disturbance
attenuation level"
"A general framework is presented for analyzing the stability and performance
of nonlinear and linear parameter varying (LPV) time delayed systems. First,
the input/output behavior of the time delay operator is bounded in the
frequency domain by integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A constant delay is
a linear, time-invariant system and this leads to a simple, intuitive
interpretation for these frequency domain constraints. This simple
interpretation is used to derive new IQCs for both constant and varying delays.
Second, the performance of nonlinear and LPV delayed systems is bounded using
dissipation inequalities that incorporate IQCs. This step makes use of recent
results that show, under mild technical conditions, that an IQC has an
equivalent representation as a finite-horizon time-domain constraint. Numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for both
class of systems."
"This paper describes a benchmark consisting of a set of synthetic
measurements relative to an office environment simulated with the software
IDA-ICE. The simulated environment reproduces a laboratory at the KTH-EES Smart
Building, equipped with a building management system. The data set contains
records collected over a period of several days. The signals to CO$_2$
concentration, mechanical ventilation airflows, air infiltrations and
occupancy. Information on door and window opening is also available. This
benchmark is intended for testing data-based modeling techniques. The ultimate
goal is the development of models to improve the forecast and control of
environmental variables. Among the numerous challenges related to this
framework, we point out the problem of occupancy estimation using information
on CO$_2$ concentration. This can be seen as a blind identification problem.
For benchmarking purposes, we present two different identification approaches:
a baseline overparametrization method and a kernel-based method."
"Most of existing results on regularized system identification focus on
regularized impulse response estimation. Since the impulse response model is a
special case of orthonormal basis functions, it is interesting to consider if
it is possible to tackle the regularized system identification using more
compact orthonormal basis functions. In this paper, we explore two
possibilities. First, we construct reproducing kernel Hilbert space of impulse
responses by orthonormal basis functions and then use the induced reproducing
kernel for the regularized impulse response estimation. Second, we extend the
regularization method from impulse response estimation to the more general
orthonormal basis functions estimation. For both cases, the poles of the basis
functions are treated as hyperparameters and estimated by empirical Bayes
method. Then we further show that the former is a special case of the latter,
and more specifically, the former is equivalent to ridge regression of the
coefficients of the orthonormal basis functions."
"Quaternion-valued wireless communication systems have been studied in the
past. Although progress has been made in this promising area, a crucial missing
link is lack of effective and efficient quaternion-valued signal processing
algorithms for channel equalisation and beamforming. With most recent
developments in quaternion-valued signal processing, in this work, we fill the
gap to solve the problem and further derive the quaternion-valued Wiener
solution for block-based calculation."
"Least mean square (LMS) type adaptive algorithms have attracted much
attention due to their low computational complexity. In the scenarios of sparse
channel estimation, zero-attracting LMS (ZA-LMS), reweighted ZA-LMS (RZA-LMS)
and reweighted -norm LMS (RL1-LMS) have been proposed to exploit channel
sparsity. However, these proposed algorithms may hard to make tradeoff between
convergence speed and estimation performance with only one step-size. To solve
this problem, we propose three sparse iterative-promoting variable step-size
LMS (IP-VSS-LMS) algorithms with sparse constraints, i.e. ZA, RZA and RL1.
These proposed algorithms are termed as ZA-IPVSS-LMS, RZA-IPVSS-LMS and
RL1-IPVSS-LMS respectively. Simulation results are provided to confirm
effectiveness of the proposed sparse channel estimation algorithms."
"The first order stable spline (SS-1) kernel is used extensively in
regularized system identification. In particular, the stable spline estimator
models the impulse response as a zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance is
given by the SS-1 kernel. In this paper, we discuss the maximum entropy
properties of this prior. In particular, we formulate the exact maximum entropy
problem solved by the SS-1 kernel without Gaussian and uniform sampling
assumptions. Under general sampling schemes, we also explicitly derive the
special structure underlying the SS-1 kernel (e.g. characterizing the
tridiagonal nature of its inverse), also giving to it a maximum entropy
covariance completion interpretation. Along the way similar maximum entropy
properties of the Wiener kernel are also given."
"This is an extended version of a technical note accepted for publication in
IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. The note proposes an Input to State
practically Stable (ISpS) formulation of distributed nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) for formation control of constrained autonomous vehicles in
presence of communication bandwidth limitation and transmission delays. Planned
trajectories are compressed using neural networks resulting in considerable
reduction of data packet size, while being robust to propagation delays and
uncertainty in neighbors' trajectories. Collision avoidance is achieved by
means of spatially filtered potential field. Analytical results proving ISpS
and generalized small gain conditions are presented for both strongly- and
weakly-connected networks, and illustrated by simulations."
"This paper studies the problem of multi-agent formation maneuver control
where both of the centroid and scale of a formation are required to track given
velocity references while maintaining the formation shape. Unlike the
conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor
relative positions or distances, we propose a bearing-based approach where the
target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings. Due to the invariance
of the bearings, the bearing-based approach provides a natural solution to
formation scale control. We assume the dynamics of each agent as a single
integrator and propose a globally stable proportional-integral formation
maneuver control law. It is shown that at least two leaders are required to
collaborate in order to control the centroid and scale of the formation whereas
the followers are not required to have access to any global information, such
as the velocities of the leaders."
"This article presents an exciting finding for the power industry: the
parameters of secondary frequency control based on integral or proportional
integral control can be tuned to achieve economic operation and frequency
regulation simultaneously. We show that if the power imbalance is represented
by frequency deviation, an iterative dual decomposition based economic dispatch
solving is equivalent to integral control. An iterative method of multipliers
based economic dispatch is equivalent to proportional integral control.
Similarly, if the controller parameters of the secondary frequency controls are
chosen based on generator cost functions, these secondary frequency controllers
achieve both economic operation and frequency regulation simultaneously."
"Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) is an essential tool for
operation of distribution networks, the results of which enables the operator
to have a thorough observation of the system. Thus, most distribution
management systems (DMS) include a single-phase state estimator. Due to
non-convexity of the SE problem, heuristic and Newton methods do not guarantee
the global solution. In contrast, SDP based SE is more promising to guarantee
the globally optimal solution since it represents and solves the problem in a
convex format. However, the observability of the power system is highly
vulnerable to the set of measurements while employing the SDP-based SE, which
is addressed in this report. An algorithm is proposed to generate additional
measurements using the measurement data already gathered. The SDP-based SE is
very sensitive to the level of noise in large power networks. Also, bad data
detection algorithms proposed for Newton methods do not work for the SDP-based
SE method due to larger number of state variables in SDP representation of
power network. In this report, an algorithm is proposed to generate additional
measurements using the measurement data already gathered in order to solve the
observability issue. A network separation algorithm is developed to solve the
entire problem for smaller sub-networks which include micro-PMUs to mitigate
the adverse effects of noise for huge networks. An algorithm based on
redundancy test is also developed for bad data detection. The algorithms are
tested on single phase and multiphase test systems. The algorithms are applied
EPRI Circuit 5 (2998-bus) test feeder to demonstrate the flexibility of the
algorithms developed."
"This paper considers a problem of output agreement in heterogeneous networks
with dynamics on the nodes as well as on the edges. The control and disturbance
signals entering the nodal dynamics are ""unmatched"" meaning that some nodes are
only subject to disturbances, and are deprived of actuating signals. To further
enrich our model, we accommodate (solvable) algebraic constraints in a subset
of nodal dynamics. We show that appropriate dynamic feedback controllers
achieve output agreement on a desired vector. We also investigate the case of
an optimal steady-state control over the network. The proposed results are
applied to a heterogeneous microgrid."
"In this paper, we adopt a new communication protocol between the UAV and
fixed on-ground nodes. This protocol tends to reduce communication power
consumption by stopping communication if the channel is not good to communicate
(i.e. far nodes, obstacles, etc.) The communication is performed using the XBee
868M standard and Libelium wapsmotes. Our designed protocol is based on a new
communication model that we propose in this paper. The protocole decides wether
to communicate or not after computing the channel reliability through prior
RSSI measurement and nodes location data"
"This paper considers the problem of detecting topology variations in
dynamical networks. We consider a network whose behavior can be represented via
a linear dynamical system. The problem of interest is then that of finding
conditions under which it is possible to detect node or link disconnections
from prior knowledge of the nominal network behavior and on-line measurements.
The considered approach makes use of analysis tools from switching systems
theory. A number of results are presented along with examples."
"This paper considers the problem of identifying the parameters of an
uncertain linear system by means of feedback control. The problem is approached
by considering time-varying controllers. It is shown that even when the
uncertainty set is not finite, parameter identifiability can be generically
ensured by switching among a finite number of linear time-invariant
controllers. The results are shown to have several implications, ranging from
fault detection and isolation to adaptive and supervisory control. Practical
aspects of the problem are also discussed in details."
"In this paper, from the structural perspective, we propose a new stability
analysis approach for the consensus of linear multi-agent systems. Different
from the general tools: the Laplacian matrix based method and the Lyapunov's
method, this approach treats the multi-agent system as the composition of many
isolated agents, and focuses on their special input and output relationship.
Through transforming the construction of a graph into a standard procedure only
including three basic structures, the stability analysis is recursive and
independent of the specific topology. Therefore, this approach can be used for
multi-agent systems on any topology graph."
"Well known in the theory of network flows, Braess paradox states that in a
congested network, it may happen that adding a new path between destinations
can increase the level of congestion. In transportation networks the phenomenon
results from the decisions of network participants who selfishly seek to
optimize their own performance metrics. In an electric power distribution
network, an analogous increase in congestion can arise as a consequence
Kirchhoff's laws. Even for the simplest linear network of resistors and voltage
sources, the sudden appearance of congestion due to an additional conductive
line is a nonlinear phenomenon that results in a discontinuous change in the
network state. It is argued that the phenomenon can occur in almost any grid in
which they are loops, and with the increasing penetration of small-scale
distributed generation it suggests challenges ahead in the operation of
microgrids."
"Recent communication, computation, and technology advances coupled with
climate change concerns have transformed the near future prospects of
electricity transmission, and, more notably, distribution systems and
microgrids. Distributed resources (wind and solar generation, combined heat and
power) and flexible loads (storage, computing, EV, HVAC) make it imperative to
increase investment and improve operational efficiency. Commercial and
residential buildings, being the largest energy consumption group among
flexible loads in microgrids, have the largest potential and flexibility to
provide demand side management. Recent advances in networked systems and the
anticipated breakthroughs of the Internet of Things will enable significant
advances in demand response capabilities of intelligent load network of
power-consuming devices such as HVAC components, water heaters, and buildings.
In this paper, a new operating framework, called packetized direct load control
(PDLC), is proposed based on the notion of quantization of energy demand. This
control protocol is built on top of two communication protocols that carry
either complete or binary information regarding the operation status of the
appliances. We discuss the optimal demand side operation for both protocols and
analytically derive the performance differences between the protocols. We
propose an optimal reservation strategy for traditional and renewable energy
for the PDLC in both day-ahead and real time markets. In the end we discuss the
fundamental trade-off between achieving controllability and endowing
flexibility."
"This thesis focuses on developing advanced control methods for two industrial
systems in discrete-time aiming to enhance their performance in delivering the
control objectives as well as considering the practical aspects. The first part
addresses wind power dispatch into the electricity network using a battery
energy storage system (BESS). To manage the amount of energy sold to the
electricity market, a novel control scheme is developed based on discrete-time
model predictive control (MPC) to ensure the optimal operation of the BESS in
the presence of practical constraints. The control scheme follows a decision
policy to sell more energy at peak demand times and store it at off-peaks in
compliance with the Australian National Electricity Market rules. The
performance of the control system is assessed under different scenarios using
actual wind farm and electricity price data in simulation environment. The
second part considers the control of overhead crane systems for automatic
operation. To achieve high-speed load transportation with high-precision and
minimum load swings, a new modeling approach is developed based on independent
joint control strategy which considers actuators as the main plant. The
nonlinearities of overhead crane dynamics are treated as disturbances acting on
each actuator. The resulting model enables us to estimate the unknown
parameters of the system including coulomb friction constants. A novel load
swing control is also designed based on passivity-based control to suppress
load swings. Two discrete-time controllers are then developed based on MPC and
state feedback control to track reference trajectories along with a feedforward
control to compensate for disturbances using computed torque control and a
novel disturbance observer. The practical results on an experimental overhead
crane setup demonstrate the high performance of the designed control systems."
"Security assessment of large-scale, strongly nonlinear power grids containing
thousands to millions of interacting components is a computationally expensive
task. Targeting at reducing the computational cost, this paper introduces a
framework for constructing a robust assessment toolbox that can provide
mathematically rigorous certificates for the grids' stability in the presence
of variations in power injections, and for the grids' ability to withstand a
bunch sources of faults. By this toolbox we can ""off-line"" screen a wide range
of contingencies or power injection profiles, without reassessing the system
stability on a regular basis. In particular, we formulate and solve two novel
robust stability and resiliency assessment problems of power grids subject to
the uncertainty in equilibrium points and uncertainty in fault-on dynamics.
Furthermore, we bring in the quadratic Lyapunov functions approach to transient
stability assessment, offering real-time construction of stability/resiliency
certificates and real-time stability assessment. The effectiveness of the
proposed techniques is numerically illustrated on a number of IEEE test cases."
"The widely used nuclear norm heuristic for rank minimization problems
introduces a regularization parameter which is difficult to tune. We have
recently proposed a method to approximate the regularization path, i.e., the
optimal solution as a function of the parameter, which requires solving the
problem only for a sparse set of points. In this paper, we extend the algorithm
to provide error bounds for the singular values of the approximation. We
exemplify the algorithms on large scale benchmark examples in model order
reduction. Here, the order of a dynamical system is reduced by means of
constrained minimization of the nuclear norm of a Hankel matrix."
"To overcome the tradeoff of the conventional normalized least mean square
(NLMS) algorithm between fast convergence rate and low steady-state
misalignment, this paper proposes a variable step size (VSS) NLMS algorithm by
devising a new strategy to update the step size. In this strategy, the input
signal power and the cross-correlation between the input signal and the error
signal are used to estimate the true tracking error power, reducing the effect
of the system noise on the algorithm performance. Moreover, the steady-state
performances of the algorithm are provided for Gaussian white input signal and
are verified by simulations. Finally, simulation results in the context of the
system identification and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) have demonstrated
that the proposed algorithm has lower steady-state misalignment than other VSS
algorithms."
"In this note, we give a complete proof that Hegselmann-Krause systems
converge on the circle following the proof strategy developed by Hegarty,
Martinsson, and Wedin."
"In recent years, advanced sensors, intelligent automation, communication
networks, and information technologies have been integrated into the electric
grid to enhance its performance and efficiency. Integrating these new
technologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependencies
between the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters and
man-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urban
infrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid and
consequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric grid
outages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic,
social, and political impacts of power system outages, the grid must be
resilient. The concept of a power system cyber-physical resilience centers
around maintaining system states at a stable level in the presence of
disturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid,
it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures,
cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid
community, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of
cyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience
for the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience.
This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical
resilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new
way of thinking about grid operation with unexpected disturbances and hazards
and leveraging distributed energy resources."
"This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting the topology of
distribution networks based on the analysis of time series measurements. The
time-based analysis approach draws on data from high-precision phasor
measurement units (PMUs or synchrophasors) for distribution systems. A key fact
is that time-series data taken from a dynamic system show specific patterns
regarding state transitions such as opening or closing switches, as a kind of
signature from each topology change. The proposed algorithm here is based on
the comparison of the actual signature of a recent state transition against a
library of signatures derived from topology simulations. The IEEE 33-bus model
is used for initial algorithm validation."
"A state-space formulation of classical scalar Preisach model (CSPM) of
hysteresis is proposed. The introduced state dynamics and memory interface
allow to use the state equation, which is rapid in calculation, instead of the
original Preisach equation. The main benefit of the proposed modeling approach
is the reduced computational effort which requires only a single integration
over the instantaneous line segment in the Preisach plane. Numerical
evaluations of the computation time and model accuracy are provided in
comparison to the CSPM which is taken as a reference model."
"A unified linear algebraic approach to adaptive signal processing (ASP) is
presented. Starting from just Ax=b, key ASP algorithms are derived in a simple,
systematic, and integrated manner without requiring any background knowledge to
the field. Algorithms covered are Steepest Descent, LMS, Normalized LMS,
Kaczmarz, Affine Projection, RLS, Kalman filter, and MMSE/Least Square Wiener
filters. By following this approach, readers will discover a synthesis; they
will learn that one and only one equation is involved in all these algorithms.
They will also learn that this one equation forms the basis of more advanced
algorithms like reduced rank adaptive filters, extended Kalman filter, particle
filters, multigrid methods, preconditioning methods, Krylov subspace methods
and conjugate gradients. This will enable them to enter many sophisticated
realms of modern research and development. Eventually, this one equation will
not only become their passport to ASP but also to many highly specialized areas
of computational science and engineering."
"We introduce feedback-control statistical system checking (FC-SSC), a new
approach to statistical model checking that exploits principles of
feedback-control for the analysis of cyber-physical systems (CPS). FC-SSC uses
stochastic system identification to learn a CPS model, importance sampling to
estimate the CPS state, and importance splitting to control the CPS so that the
probability that the CPS satisfies a given property can be efficiently
inferred. We illustrate the utility of FC-SSC on two example applications, each
of which is simple enough to be easily understood, yet complex enough to
exhibit all of FC-SCC's features. To the best of our knowledge, FC-SSC is the
first statistical system checker to efficiently estimate the probability of
rare events in realistic CPS applications or in any complex probabilistic
program whose model is either not available, or is infeasible to derive through
static-analysis techniques."
"Fundamental theory on battery-powered cyber-physical systems (CPS) calls for
dynamic models that are able to describe and predict the status of processors
and batteries at any given time. We believe that the idealized system of single
processor powered by single battery (SPSB) can be viewed as a generic case for
the modeling effort. This paper introduces a dynamic model for multiple
aperiodic tasks on a SPSB system under a scheduling algorithm that resembles
the rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) within finite time windows. The model
contains two major modules. The first module is an online battery capacity
model based on the Rakhmatov-Vrudhula-Wallach (RVW) model. This module provides
predictions of remaining battery capacity based on the knowledge of the battery
discharging current. The second module is a dynamical scheduling model that can
predict the scheduled behavior of tasks within any finite time window, without
the need to store all past information about each task before the starting time
of the finite time window. The module provides a complete analytical
description of the relationship among tasks and it delineates all possible
modes of the processor utilization as square-wave functions of time. The two
modules i.e. the scheduling model and the battery model are integrated to
obtain a hybrid scheduling model that describes the dynamic behaviors of the
SPSB system. Our effort may have demonstrated that through dynamic modeling,
different components of CPS may be integrated under a unified theoretical
framework centered around hybrid systems theory."
"The issue of security has become ever more prevalent in the analysis and
design of cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we analyze a consensus network
in the presence of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, namely attacks that prevent
communication among the network agents. By introducing a notion of
Persistency-of-Communication (PoC), we provide a characterization of DoS
frequency and duration such that consensus is not destroyed. An example is
given to substantiate the analysis."
"This brief memo reviews the theory of Unknown Input Observers (UIO) for state
estimation in systems subject to disturbance inputs that are not known a
priori. One main advantage of the UIO is that the observer structure naturally
decouples the plant inputs from the state estimation process. This advantage is
highlighted in three example dynamic systems commonly found in control theory.
It is shown that the estimation error for all three systems asymptotically
approaches zero by application of the UIO under the influence of dynamic
disturbances."
"We consider malicious attacks on actuators and sensors of a feedback system
which can be modeled as additive, possibly unbounded, disturbances at the
digital (cyber) part of the feedback loop. We precisely characterize the role
of the unstable poles and zeros of the system in the ability to detect stealthy
attacks in the context of the sampled data implementation of the controller in
feedback with the continuous (physical) plant. We show that, if there is a
single sensor that is guaranteed to be secure and the plant is observable from
that sensor, then there exist a class of multirate sampled data controllers
that ensure that all attacks remain detectable. These dual rate controllers are
sampling the output faster than the zero order hold rate that operates on the
control input and as such, they can even provide better nominal performance
than single rate, at the price of higher sampling of the continuous output."
"Big networks express various large-scale networks in many practical areas
such as computer networks, internet of things, cloud computation, manufacturing
systems, transportation networks, and healthcare systems. This paper analyzes
such big networks, and applies the mean-field theory and the nonlinear Markov
processes to set up a broad class of nonlinear continuous-time block-structured
Markov processes, which can be applied to deal with many practical stochastic
systems. Firstly, a nonlinear Markov process is derived from a large number of
interacting big networks with symmetric interactions, each of which is
described as a continuous-time block-structured Markov process. Secondly, some
effective algorithms are given for computing the fixed points of the nonlinear
Markov process by means of the UL-type RG-factorization. Finally, the Birkhoff
center, the Lyapunov functions and the relative entropy are used to analyze
stability or metastability of the big network, and several interesting open
problems are proposed with detailed interpretation. We believe that the results
given in this paper can be useful and effective in the study of big networks."
"Magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) is an efficient method for realizing the
near-field wireless power transfer (WPT). Although the MRC enabled WPT
(MRC-WPT) with a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been thoroughly
studied in the literature, there is limited work on the general setup with
multiple transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a
point-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter delivering wireless
power to a set of distributed receivers. We aim to introduce new applications
of signal processing and optimization techniques to the performance
characterization and optimization in multiuser WPT via MRC. We first derive
closed-form expressions for the power drawn from the energy source at the
transmitter and that delivered to the load at each receiver. We identify a
""near-far"" fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to receivers'
distance-dependent mutual inductance with the transmitter. To tackle this
issue, we propose a centralized charging control algorithm to jointly optimize
the receivers' load resistance to minimize the total transmitter power drawn
while meeting the given power requirement of each individual load. For ease of
practical implementation, we also devise a distributed algorithm for the
receivers to adjust their load resistance independently in an iterative manner.
Last, we characterize the power region that constitutes all the achievable
power-tuples of the loads via controlling their adjustable resistance. In
particular, we compare the power regions without versus with the time sharing
of users' power transmission, where it is shown that time sharing yields a
larger power region in general. Extensive simulation results are provided to
validate our analysis and corroborate our study on the multiuser MRC-WPT
system."
"From the structural perspective, this paper investigates a new formulation of
the concept of input-to-state stability (ISS), and based on this formulation,
proposes a new stability analysis approach for a class of interconnected
system. The new formulation of ISS is better able to reflect the tendency of
the state $x(t)$ tracking the input $u(t)$ and weakens the conservative of the
original form. The stability analysis method which transforms the
interconnected system into the equivalent cascade form, does not depend on the
Lyapunov function, breaks through the limitation of the small-gain theorem and
extends the application of ISS. As its applications in three typical kinds of
interconnected systems, this method is used to prove the small-gain theorem
again and analyzes the stability of a class of interconnected system and the
consensus of the multi-agent system (MAS)."
"The operation of groups of heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) at a small
inter-vehicular distance (known as platoon) allows to lower the overall
aerodynamic drag and, therefore, to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions. However, due to the large mass and limited engine power of HDVs,
slopes have a significant impact on the feasible and optimal speed profiles
that each vehicle can and should follow. Therefore maintaining a short
inter-vehicular distance as required by platooning without coordination between
vehicles can often result in inefficient or even unfeasible trajectories. In
this paper we propose a two-layer control architecture for HDV platooning aimed
to safely and fuel-efficiently coordinate the vehicles in the platoon. Here,
the layers are responsible for the inclusion of preview information on road
topography and the real-time control of the vehicles, respectively. Within this
architecture, dynamic programming is used to compute the fuel-optimal speed
profile for the entire platoon and a distributed model predictive control
framework is developed for the real-time control of the vehicles. The
effectiveness of the proposed controller is analyzed by means of simulations of
several realistic scenarios that suggest a possible fuel saving of up to 12%
for the follower vehicles compared to the use of standard platoon controllers."
"In this paper we address the problem of dynamic pricing for toll lanes on
freeways. The proposed toll mechanism is broken up into two parts: (1) the
supply side feedback control that computes the desired split ratios for the
incoming traffic flows between the general purpose and the toll lanes; and (2)
the demand side price setting algorithm that aims to enforce the computed split
ratios.
  The split ratio controller is designed and tested in the context of the
link-node Cell Transmission Model with the modified node model of in/out flow
distribution. The equilibrium structure of this traffic model is presented; and
the case, in which the existence of a toll lane is meaningful, is discussed.
  For the price setting, two alternative approaches are presented. The first
one is commonly used, and it relies on the known Value of Time (VoT)
distribution. Its shortcoming, however, is in the difficulty of the VoT
distribution estimation. The second approach employs the auction mechanism,
where travelers make bids on places in the toll lane. The advantage of this
approach is that it enables direct control over how many vehicles will be
allowed into the toll lane."
"This article addresses the residential energy cost optimization problem in
smart grid. To date, most of the previous research only consider a partial
aspect of the cost optimization problem. As a result, they fail to analyze
scenarios when the interconnected components along with their properties have
to be considered simultaneously. The proposed model combines these partial
models into a single unified cost optimization model. Therefore, it is able to
analyze scenarios which are closer to practical implementation. Furthermore, it
is useful to analyze the behavior of a population (e.g., smart buildings, smart
cities, etc.) and properties of the components for specific scenarios (e.g.,
the impact of aggregate storage capacity, etc.). It allows energy trading in
microgrid which introduces a cost fairness problem. It ensures Pareto
optimality among the households which guarantees that no household will be
worse off to improve the cost of others. Results show that it can maintain the
user preferences and can react to a demand response program by rescheduling the
household loads and sources. Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of the
computational complexity of the proposed model, showing that solution time
increases exponentially with the problem size and proposes possible approaches
to solve this."
"We introduce a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) framework
for synthesizing continuous-time switching controllers that guarantee reach
while stay (RWS) properties of the closed loop system. The solution is based on
synthesizing specially defined class of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for
switched systems, that yield switching controllers with a guaranteed minimum
dwell time in each mode. Next, we use a CEGIS-based approach to iteratively
solve the resulting quantified exists-forall constraints, and find a CLF. We
introduce relaxations to guarantee termination, as well as heuristics to
increase convergence speed. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a set of
benchmarks ranging from two to six state variables. Our evaluation includes a
preliminary comparison with related tools. The proposed approach shows the
promise of nonlinear SMT solvers for the synthesis of provably correct
switching control laws."
"In this paper, we consider the state controllability of networked systems,
where the network topology is directed and weighted and the nodes are
higher-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. We
investigate how the network topology, the node-system dynamics, the external
control inputs, and the inner interactions affect the controllability of a
networked system, and show that for a general networked
multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) system: 1) the controllability of the overall
network is an integrated result of the aforementioned relevant factors, which
cannot be decoupled into the controllability of individual node-systems and the
properties solely determined by the network topology, quite different from the
familiar notion of consensus or formation controllability; 2) if the network
topology is uncontrollable by external inputs, then the networked system with
identical nodes will be uncontrollable, even if it is structurally
controllable; 3) with a controllable network topology, controllability and
observability of the nodes together are necessary for the controllability of
the networked systems under some mild conditions, but nevertheless they are not
sufficient. For a networked system with single-input/single-output (SISO) LTI
nodes, we present precise necessary and sufficient conditions for the
controllability of a general network topology."
"One of the major problems in adaptive filtering is the problem of system
identification. It has been studied extensively due to its immense practical
importance in a variety of fields. The underlying goal is to identify the
impulse response of an unknown system. This is accomplished by placing a known
system in parallel and feeding both systems with the same input. Due to initial
disparity in their impulse responses, an error is generated between their
outputs. This error is set to tune the impulse response of known system in a
way that every change in impulse response reduces the magnitude of prospective
error. This process is repeated until the error becomes negligible and the
responses of both systems match. To specifically minimize the error, numerous
adaptive algorithms are available. They are noteworthy either for their low
computational complexity or high convergence speed. Recently, a method, known
as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), has gained much attention due to its
remarkably low computational complexity. But despite this colossal advantage,
properties of MCMC method have not been investigated for adaptive system
identification problem. This article bridges this gap by providing a complete
treatment of MCMC method in the aforementioned context."
"We propose a systematic method to directly identify a sensor fault estimation
filter from plant input/output data collected under fault-free condition. This
problem is challenging, especially when omitting the step of building an
explicit state-space plant model in data-driven design, because the inverse of
the underlying plant dynamics is required and needs to be stable. We show that
it is possible to address this problem by relying on a system-inversion-based
fault estimation filter that is parameterized using identified Markov
parameters. Our novel data-driven approach improves estimation performance by
avoiding the propagation of model reduction errors originating from
identification of the state-space plant model into the designed filter.
Furthermore, it allows additional design freedom to stabilize the obtained
filter under the same stabilizability condition as the existing model-based
system inversion. This crucial property enables its application to sensor
faults in unstable plants, where existing data-driven filter designs could not
be applied so far due to the lack of such stability guarantees (even after
stabilizing the closed-loop system). A numerical simulation example of sensor
faults in an unstable aircraft system illustrates the effectiveness of the
proposed new method."
"In this paper, a novel sensor fault detection, isolation and identification
(FDII) strategy is proposed by using the multiple model (MM) approach. The
scheme is based on multiple hybrid Kalman filters (HKF) which represents an
integration of a nonlinear mathematical model of the system with a number of
piecewise linear (PWL) models. The proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI)
scheme is capable of detecting and isolating sensor faults during the entire
operational regime of the system by interpolating the PWL models using a
Bayesian approach. Moreover, the proposed multiple HKF-based FDI scheme is
extended to identify the magnitude of a sensor fault by using a modified
generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) method which relies on the healthy
operational mode of the system. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposed
FDII methodology, extensive simulation studies are conducted for a nonlinear
gas turbine engine. Various single and concurrent sensor fault scenarios are
considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed on-line
hierarchical multiple HKF-based FDII scheme under different flight modes.
Finally, our proposed HKF-based FDI approach is compared with various filtering
methods such as the linear, extended, unscented and cubature Kalman filters
(LKF, EKF, UKF and CKF, respectively) corresponding to both interacting and
non-interacting multiple model (MM) based schemes. Our comparative studies
confirm the superiority of our proposed HKF method in terms of promptness of
the fault detection, lower false alarm rates, as well as robustness with
respect to the engine health parameters degradations."
"Storage-concerned economic dispatch (ED) problems with complementarity
constraints are strongly non-convex and hard to solve because traditional
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions do not hold in this condition. In our
recent paper, we proposed a new exact relaxation method which directly removes
the complementarity constraints from the model to make it convex and easier to
solve. This paper further extends our previous study, with more than one group
of sufficient conditions that guarantee the exact relaxation presented, proven
and discussed. This paper may contribute to wider application of the exact
relaxation in storage-concerned ED problems."
"This paper introduces a new method to control resonance frequency and output
power of induction heating coil. Induction heating coil can be controlled by
single phase sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) inverter .All electrical
requirements beside magnetic permeability and resistivity variation for
modeling induction heating coil have been considered to make simulations
practical .Control blocks using Fuzzy logic which control both active and
reactive power have been designed .The system modeling and Fuzzy logic
controllers are simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and FUZZY LOGIC toolbox .The
results of the simulations show the effectiveness and superiority of this
control system."
"In this paper we show how to split the Root Locus plot for an irreducible
rational transfer function into several individual algebraic plane curves, like
lines, circles, conics, etc. To achieve this goal we use results of a previous
paper of the author to represent the Root Locus as an algebraic variety
generated by an ideal over a polynomial ring, and whose primary decomposion
allow us to isolate the planes curves that composes the Root Locus. As a
by-product, using the concept of duality in projective algebraic geometry, we
show how to obtain the dual curve of each plane curve that composes the Root
Locus and unite them to obtain what we denominate the ""Algebraic Dual Root
Locus""."
"An algebraic expression for the Preisach hysteron, which is a non-ideal
(delayed) relay operator, is formulated for a computationally efficient
real-time implementation. This allows representing the classical scalar
Preisach hysteresis model as a summation of a large number of weighted
hysterons which computation can be accomplished in parallel. The latter makes
possible an efficient FPGA or ASIC realization of the scalar Preisach
hysteresis model that can be useful for multiple applications. The signal flow
which specifies the model implementation is provided in form of the block
diagram. The proposed computation of Preisach hysterons, aggregated to the
entire Preisach hysteresis model, is evaluated numerically and on a real-time
hardware platform."
"In actual implementations of magnetic control laws for spacecraft attitude
stabilization, the time in which Earth magnetic field is measured must be
separated from the time in which magnetic dipole moment is generated. The
latter separation translates into the constraint of being able to genere only
piecewise-constant magnetic dipole moment. In this work we present attitude
stabilization laws using only magnetic actuators that take into account of the
latter aspect. Both a state feedback and an output feedback are presented, and
it is shown that the proposed design allows for a systematic selection of the
sampling period."
"The phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem is revisited by taking
into account a stronger characterization of the electrical connectedness
between various buses in the grid. To facilitate this study, the placement
problem is approached from the perspective of the \emph{electrical structure}
which, unlike previous work on PMU placement, accounts for the sensitivity
between power injections and nodal phase angle differences between various
buses in the power network. The problem is formulated as a binary integer
program with the objective to minimize the number of PMUs for complete network
observability in the absence of zero injection measurements. The implication of
the proposed approach on static state estimation and fault detection algorithms
incorporating PMU measurements is analyzed. Results show a significant
improvement in the performance of estimation and detection schemes by employing
the electrical structure-based PMU placement compared to its topological
counterpart. In light of recent advances in the electrical structure of the
grid, our study provides a more realistic perspective of PMU placement in the
electric power grid."
"Future power grids will offer enhanced controllability due to the increased
availability of power flow control units (FACTS). As the installation of
control units in the grid is an expensive investment, we are interested in
using few controllers to achieve high controllability. In particular, two
questions arise: How many flow control buses are necessary to obtain globally
optimal power flows? And if fewer flow control buses are available, what can we
achieve with them? Using steady state IEEE benchmark data sets, we explore
experimentally that already a small number of controllers placed at certain
grid buses suffices to achieve globally optimal power flows. We present a
graph-theoretic explanation for this behavior. To answer the second question we
perform a set of experiments that explore the existence and costs of feasible
power flow solutions at increased loads with respect to the number of flow
control buses in the grid. We observe that adding a small number of flow
control buses reduces the flow costs and extends the existence of feasible
solutions at increased load."
"In light of growing attention of intelligent vehicle systems, we propose
developing a driver model that uses a hybrid system formulation to capture the
intent of the driver. This model hopes to capture human driving behavior in a
way that can be utilized by semi- and fully autonomous systems in heterogeneous
environments. We consider a discrete set of high level goals or intent modes,
that is designed to encompass the decision making process of the human. A
driver model is derived using a dataset of lane changes collected in a
realistic driving simulator, in which the driver actively labels data to give
us insight into her intent. By building the labeled dataset, we are able to
utilize classification tools to build the driver model using features of based
on her perception of the environment, and achieve high accuracy in identifying
driver intent. Multiple algorithms are presented and compared on the dataset,
and a comparison of the varying behaviors between drivers is drawn. Using this
modeling methodology, we present a model that can be used to assess driver
behaviors and to develop human-inspired safety metrics that can be utilized in
intelligent vehicular systems."
"This paper presents a new method for studying electromechanical transients in
power systems using three phase, combined transmission and distribution models
(hybrid models). The methodology models individual phases of an electric
network and associated unbalance in load and generation. Therefore, the impacts
of load unbalance, single phase distributed generation and line impedance
unbalance on electromechanical transients can be studied without using
electromagnetic transient simulation (EMTP) programs. The implementation of
this methodology in software is called the Three Phase Dynamics Analyzer
(TPDA). Case studies included in the paper demonstrate the accuracy of TPDA and
its ability to simulate electromechanical transients in hybrid models. TPDA has
the potential for providing electric utilities and power system planners with
more accurate assessment of system stability than traditional dynamic
simulation software that assume balanced network topology."
"This paper presents a novel model of large-size tilt-rotor aircraft, which
can operate as a helicopter as well as being capable of transition to
fixed-wing flight. Aerodynamics of the dynamic large-size tilt-rotors based on
blade element method is analyzed during mode transition. For the large-size
aircraft with turboshaft engines, the blade pitch angles of the rotors are
regulated to vary according to the desired level of thrust, and the following
expressions are formulated explicitly: rotor thrust and blade pitch angle, drag
torque and blade pitch angle. A finite-time convergent observer based on
Lyapunov function is developed to reconstruct the unknown variables and
uncertainties during mode transitions. The merits of this design include the
modeling of dynamic large-size tilt-rotor, ease of the uncertainties estimation
during the tilting and the widely applications. Moreover, a switched logic
controller based on the finite-time convergent observer is proposed to drive
the aircraft to implement the mode transition with invariant flying height."
"In this paper, we study networks of discrete-time linear time-invariant
subsystems. Our focus is on situations where subsystems are connected to each
other through a time-invariant topology and where there exists a base-station
whose aim is to control the subsystems into any desired destinations. However,
the base-station can only communicate with some of the subsystems that we refer
to as leaders. There are no direct links between the base-station and the rest
of subsystems, known as followers, as they are only able to liaise among
themselves and with some of the leaders.
  The current paper formulates this framework as the well-known reachability
problem for linear systems. Then to address this problem, we introduce notions
of leader-reachability and base-reachability. We present algebraic conditions
under which these notions hold. It turns out that if subsystems are represented
by minimal state space representations, then base-reachability always holds.
Hence, we focus on leader-reachability and investigate the corresponding
conditions in detail. We further demonstrate that when the networked system
parameters i.e. subsystems' parameters and interconnection matrices, assume
generic values then the whole network is both leader-reachable and
base-reachable."
"To overcome the performance degradation of adaptive filtering algorithms in
the presence of impulsive noise, a novel normalized sign algorithm (NSA) based
on a convex combination strategy, called NSA-NSA, is proposed in this paper.
The proposed algorithm is capable of solving the conflicting requirement of
fast convergence rate and low steady-state error for an individual NSA filter.
To further improve the robustness to impulsive noises, a mixing parameter
updating formula based on a sign cost function is derived. Moreover, a tracking
weight transfer scheme of coefficients from a fast NSA filter to a slow NSA
filter is proposed to speed up the convergence rate. The convergence behavior
and performance of the new algorithm are verified by theoretical analysis and
simulation studies."
"Impulsive dynamical systems is a well-established area of dynamical systems
theory, and it is used in this work to analyze several basic properties of
reset control systems: existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous
dependence on the initial condition (well-posedness). The work scope is about
reset control systems with a linear and time-invariant base system, and a
zero-crossing resetting law. A necessary and sufficient condition for existence
and uniqueness of solutions, based on the well-posedness of reset instants, is
developed. As a result, it is shown that reset control systems (with strictly
proper plants) do no have Zeno solutions. It is also shown that full reset and
partial reset (with a special structure) always produce well-posed reset
instants. Moreover, a definition of continuous dependence on the initial
condition is developed, and also a sufficient condition for reset control
systems to satisfy that property. Finally, this property is used to analyze
sensitivity of reset control systems to sensor noise. This work also includes a
number of illustrative examples motivating the key concepts and main results."
"Two different aspects of formation control of multiple agents subjected to
linear transformation have been addressed in this paper. We consider a set of
complex single integrator systems so that the dimension of the system reduces
to half as opposed to the vector representation in Cartesian coordinate system.
We first design a stable formation controller in an attempt to solve the
formation control turned to stabilization problem and then find a collision
avoidance controller in the transformed domain, respectively. Different linear
transformations are used to facilitate the formation control task in a
different way. For example Jacobi transformation is used to separate the shape
control and trajectory control. The inverse of the transformation must have
nonzero eigenvalues with both positive and negative real parts which may lead
the system to instability. If the inverse of the transformation appears in
closed loop then a diagonal stabilizing matrix is required to reassign the
eigenvalues of the inverse of transformation in the right half of complex
plane. The algorithm to find such stabilizing matrix is provided. We then
define a matrix of potential in the actual domain which is the stepping stone
to find a matrix of potential in the transformed domain. Thus collision
avoidance controller can be designed directly in the transformed domain. The
mathematical proof is given that both the actual and transformed system behaves
identically. Simulation results are provided to support our claim."
"This note introduces a sufficient Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) condition
for the ultimate boundedness of a class of continuous-time dynamical systems
with conic uncertain/nonlinear terms."
"In the paper, a mathematical model assembling a ""driver - mobile vehicle -
road environment"" system and capable of simulating the process of mobile
vehicles skid in traction movement mode is proposed. The usage of non-linear
drift models allows the development of efficient algorithms for mobile vehicles
dynamic stabilization systems."
"In this paper, we propose a multiplex proportional-integral approach, for
solving consensus problems in networks of heterogeneous nodes dynamics affected
by constant disturbances. The proportional and integral actions are deployed on
two different layers across the network, each with its own topology. Sufficient
conditions for convergence are derived that depend upon the structure of the
network, the parameters characterizing the control layers and the node
dynamics. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated using a
power network model as a representative example."
"Sustained oscillations observed in power systems can damage equipment,
degrade the power quality and increase the risks of cascading blackouts. There
are several mechanisms that can give rise to oscillations, each requiring
different countermeasure to suppress or eliminate the oscillation. This work
develops mathematical framework for analysis of sustained oscillations and
identifies statistical signatures of each mechanism, based on which a novel
oscillation diagnosis method is developed via real-time processing of phasor
measurement units (PMUs) data. Case studies show that the proposed method can
accurately identify the exact mechanism for sustained oscillation, and
meanwhile provide insightful information to locate the oscillation sources."
"The conventional control paradigm for a heat pump with a less efficient
auxiliary heating element is to keep its temperature set point constant during
the day. This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump
operates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of
activating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a
constant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a
thermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the
set-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g. when the occupants are
not at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential
decision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. A
first challenge is that for most residential buildings a description of the
thermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to
obtain. A second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e.
the building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to
overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with
a batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated
for two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in
the winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the
proposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4-9% during 100
winter days and by 9-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional
constant set-point strategy"
"We address the optimal transmit power allocation problem (from the sensor
nodes (SNs) to the fusion center (FC)) for the decentralized detection of an
unknown deterministic spatially uncorrelated signal which is being observed by
a distributed wireless sensor network. We propose a novel fully distributed
algorithm, in order to calculate the optimal transmit power allocation for each
sensor node (SN) and the optimal number of quantization bits for the test
statistic in order to match the channel capacity. The SNs send their quantized
information over orthogonal uncorrelated channels to the FC which linearly
combines them and makes a final decision. What makes this scheme attractive is
that the SNs share with their neighbours just their individual transmit powers
at the current states. As a result, the SN processing complexity is further
reduced."
"We consider a class of consensus systems driven by a nonlinear input. Such
systems arise in a class of IoT applications. Our objective in this paper is to
determine conditions under which a certain partially distributed system
converges to a Lur'e-like scalar system, and to provide a rigorous proof of its
stability. Conditions are derived for the non-uniform convergence and stability
of such a system and an example is given of a speed advisory system where such
a system arises in real engineering practice."
"One of the key ideas to make Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) work
effectively is to deploy advanced communication and cooperative control
technologies among the vehicles and road infrastructures. In this spirit, we
propose a consensus-based distributed speed advisory system that optimally
determines a recommended common speed for a given area in order that the group
emissions, or group battery consumptions, are minimised. Our algorithms achieve
this in a privacy-aware manner; namely, individual vehicles do not reveal
in-vehicle information to other vehicles or to infrastructure. A mobility
simulator is used to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm, and
hardware-in-the-loop tests involving a real vehicle are given to illustrate
user acceptability and ease of the deployment."
"In this paper, frequency-domain analysis based on frequency sweep method is
presented for a nonlinear double integrator and a new linear integrator. All
the two types of integrators can estimate the onefold and double integrals of a
signal synchronously. With respect to the linear double integrator, the
nonlinear integrator has better estimation performance and stronger robustness.
Importantly, the integrator parameters can be regulated from the
frequency-domain analysis."
"Finite time analysis of the continuous system is investigated through both
stability and stabilization based on Sum of squares programming. A systematic
approach is proposed to construct Lyapunov function and Control Lyapunov
function for this objective. The Region of reaching, the set which has the
property that all trajectories starting from initial point inside it reach to
the origin in finite time, is introduced, and The largest subset of region of
reaching is estimated using Lyapunov based technique. The main results are
presented to give sufficient conditions which can be translated by
semi-definite program. These conditions are provided a feasibility problem
involving sum of squares constraints. The results of the paper are then
verified by several simulation and numerical examples. Furthermore, one
important practical application namely as a super twisting second order sliding
mode control also is presented using the proposed result to illustrate its
effectiveness."
"In this paper, a generalized differentiation-integration observer is
presented based on sensors selection. The proposed differentiation-integration
observer can estimate the multiple integrals and high-order derivatives of a
signal, synchronously. The parameters selection rules are presented for the
differentiation-integration observer. The theoretical results are confirmed by
the frequency-domain analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed observer are
verified through the numerical simulations on a quadrotor aircraft: i) through
the differentiation-integration observer, the attitude angle and the
uncertainties in attitude dynamics are estimated synchronously from the
measurements of angular velocity; ii) a control law is designed based on the
observers to drive the aircraft to track a reference trajectory."
"Nonlinear Kalman Filters are powerful and widely-used techniques when trying
to estimate the hidden state of a stochastic nonlinear dynamic system. In this
paper, we extend the Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S2KF) with a new point
symmetric Gaussian sampling scheme. This not only improves the S2KF's
estimation quality, but also reduces the time needed to compute the required
optimal Gaussian samples drastically. Moreover, we improve the numerical
stability of the sample computation, which allows us to accurately approximate
a thousand-dimensional Gaussian distribution using tens of thousands of
optimally placed samples. We evaluate the new symmetric S2KF by computing
higher-order moments of standard normal distributions and investigate the
estimation quality of the S2KF when dealing with symmetric measurement
equations. Finally, extended object tracking based on many measurements per
time step is considered. This high-dimensional estimation problem shows the
advantage of the S2KF being able to use an arbitrary number of samples
independent of the state dimension, in contrast to other state-of-the-art
sample-based Kalman Filters."
"In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of an uncertain system in
a networked control setting. Due to the network, the measurements are quantized
to finite-bit signals and may be randomly lost in the communication. We study
uncertain autoregressive systems whose state and input parameters vary within
given intervals. We derive conditions for making the plant output to be mean
square stable, characterizing limitations on data rate, packet loss
probabilities, and magnitudes of uncertainty. It is shown that a specific class
of nonuniform quantizers can achieve stability with a lower data rate compared
with the common uniform one."
"In this paper, the variable wind power is incorporated into the dynamic model
for long-term stability analysis. A theory-based method is proposed for power
systems with wind power to conduct long-term stability analysis, which is able
to provide accurate stability assessments with fast simulation speed.
Particularly, the theoretical foundation for the proposed approximation
approach is presented. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are
illustrated by several numerical examples."
"The finiteness of fossil fuels implies that future electric power systems may
predominantly source energy from fuel-free renewable resources like wind and
solar. Evidently, these power systems without fuel will be environmentally
benign, sustainable, and subject to milder failure scenarios. Many of these
advantages were projected decades ago with the definition of the soft energy
path, which describes a future where all energy is provided by numerous small,
simple, and diverse renewable sources. Here we provide a thorough investigation
of power systems without fuel from technical and economic standpoints. The
paper is organized by timescale and covers issues like the irrelevance of unit
commitment in networks without large, fuel-based generators, the dubiousness of
nodal pricing without fuel costs, and the need for new system-level models and
control methods for semiconductor-based energy-conversion interfaces."
"This manuscript contains technical details of recent results developed by the
authors on the algorithm for direct design of controllers for nonlinear systems
from data that has the ability to to automatically modify some of the tuning
parameters in order to increase control performance over time."
"The goal of this report is to define abstractions for multi-agent systems
with feedback interconnection in their dynamics. In the proposed decentralized
framework, we specify a finite or countable transition system for each agent
which only takes into account the discrete positions of its neighbors. The
dynamics of the considered systems consist of two components. An appropriate
feedback law which guarantees that certain system and network requirements are
fulfilled and induces coupled constraints, and additional free inputs which we
exploit in order to accomplish high level tasks. In this work, we provide
sufficient conditions on the space and time discretization for the abstraction
of the system's behaviour which ensure that we can extract a well posed and
hence meaningful transition system. Furthermore, these conditions include
design parameters whose tuning provides the possibility for multiple
transitions, and hence, enable the construction of transition systems with
motion planning capabilities."
"Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems are ubiquitous in control applications.
Unbounded-time reachability analysis that can cope with industrial-scale models
with thousands of variables is needed. To tackle this problem, we use abstract
acceleration, a method for unbounded-time polyhedral reachability analysis for
linear systems. Existing variants of the method are restricted to closed
systems, i.e., dynamical models without inputs or non-determinism. In this
paper, we present an extension of abstract acceleration to linear loops with
inputs, which correspond to discrete-time LTI control systems under guard
conditions. The new method relies on a relaxation of the solution of the linear
dynamical equation that leads to a precise over-approximation of the set of
reachable states, which are evaluated using support functions. In order to
increase scalability, we use floating-point computations and ensure soundness
by interval arithmetic. Our experiments show that performance increases by
several orders of magnitude over alternative approaches in the literature. In
turn, this tremendous gain allows us to improve on precision by computing more
expensive abstractions. We outperform state-of-the-art tools for unbounded-time
analysis of LTI system with inputs in speed as well as in precision."
"This paper studies distributed maneuver control of multi-agent formations in
arbitrary dimensions. The objective is to control the translation and scale of
the formation while maintaining the desired formation pattern. Unlike
conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by relative
positions or distances, we propose a novel bearing-based approach where the
target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings. Since the bearings are
invariant to the translation and scale of the formation, the bearing-based
approach provides a simple solution to the problem of translational and scaling
formation maneuver control. Linear formation control laws for double-integrator
dynamics are proposed and the global formation stability is analyzed. This
paper also studies bearing-based formation control in the presence of practical
problems including input disturbances, acceleration saturation, and collision
avoidance. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical simulations."
"In his 2005 paper, S.T. Smith proposed an intrinsic Cram\'er-Rao bound on the
variance of estimators of a parameter defined on a Riemannian manifold. In the
present technical note, we consider the special case where the parameter lives
in a Lie group. In this case, by choosing, e.g., the right invariant metric,
parallel transport becomes very simple, which allows a more straightforward and
natural derivation of the bound in terms of Lie bracket, albeit for a slightly
different definition of the estimation error. For bi-invariant metrics, the Lie
group exponential map we use to define the estimation error, and the Riemannian
exponential map used by S.T. Smith coincide, and we prove in this case that
both results are identical indeed."
"In this paper, several necessary and sufficient graphical conditions are
derived for the controllability of multi-agent systems by taking advantage of
the proposed concept of controllability destructive nodes. A key step of
arriving at this result is the establishment of a relationship between topology
structures of the controllability destructive nodes and a specific eigenvector
of the Laplacian matrix. The results on double, triple and quadruple
controllability destructive nodes constitute a novel approach to study the
controllability. In particular, the approach is applied to the graph consisting
of five nodes to get a complete graphical characterization of controllability."
"Comparison of tacho-oscillographic and oscillometric methods for human blood
pressure measurement with cuff occlusion in the same device at the same time is
described. For this purpose the measurement system and software for signal
processing that realize these methods in the same device was developed.
Experiment shows that oscillometric method with photoplethysmographic (PPG)
sensors does not require empiric criteria to search systolic and diastolic
blood pressure parameters due to possibility to apply correlation analysis.
Perspectives of applying oscillometric method with PPG sensors in automatic
blood pressure monitors is showed."
"We consider balanced flows in a natural gas transmission network and discuss
computationally hard problems such as establishing if solution of the
underlying nonlinear gas flow equations exists, if it is unique, and finding
the solution. Particular topologies, e.g. trees, are known to be easy to solve
based on a variational description of the gas flow equations, but these
approaches do not generalize. In this paper, we show that the gas flow problem
can be solved efficiently using the tools of monotone operator theory, provided
that we look for solution within certain monotonicity domains. We characterize
a family of monotonicity domains, described in terms of Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMI) in the state variables, each containing at most one
solution. We also develop an efficient algorithm to choose a particular
monotonicity domain, for which the LMI based condition simplifies to a bound on
the flows. Performance of the technique is illustrated on exemplary gas
networks."
"This paper presents a model of an agile tail-sitter aircraft, which can
operate as a helicopter as well as capable of transition to fixed-wing flight.
Aerodynamics of the co-axial counter-rotating propellers with quad rotors are
analysed under the condition that the co-axial is operated at equal rotor
torque (power). A finite-time convergent observer based on Lyapunov function is
presented to estimate the unknown nonlinear terms in co-axial counter-rotating
propellers, the uncertainties and external disturbances during mode transition.
Furthermore, a simple controller based on the finite-time convergent observer
and quaternion method is designed to implement mode transition."
"Plug-in electrical vehicles (PEV) are capable of both grid-to-vehicle (G2V)
and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power transfer. The advantages of developing V2G
include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability
and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and
eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity. Here we
show how smart control of PEVs can improve the stability of power grids using
only local frequency measurements. We evaluate the proposed control strategy on
the IEEE Case 3 and the IEEE New England power systems. The results show that
V2G leads to improved steady-state stability, larger region of stability,
reduced frequency and voltage fluctuations during transients and longer
critical clearing times."
"Contingency screening for transient stability of large-scale, strongly
nonlinear, interconnected power systems is one of the most computationally
challenging parts of Dynamic Security Assessment and requires huge resources to
perform time-domain simulations-based assessment. To reduce computational cost
of time-domain simulations, direct energy methods have been extensively
developed. However, these methods, as well as other existing methods, still
rely on time-consuming numerical integration of the fault-on dynamics. This
task is computationally hard, since possibly thousands of contingencies need to
be scanned and thousands of accompanied fault-on dynamics simulations need to
be performed and stored on a regular basis. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework to eliminate the need for fault-on dynamics simulations in
contingency screening. This simulation-free framework is based on bounding the
fault-on dynamics and extending the recently introduced Lyapunov Function
Family approach for transient stability analysis of structure-preserving model.
In turn, a lower bound of the critical clearing time (CCT) is obtained by
solving convex optimization problems without relying on any time-domain
simulations. A comprehensive analysis is carried out to validate this novel
technique on a number of IEEE test cases."
"We develop a new approach for construction of convex analytically simple
regions where the AC power flow equations are guaranteed to have a feasible
solutions. Construction of these regions is based on efficient semidefinite
programming techniques accelerated via sparsity exploiting algorithms.
Resulting regions have a simple geometric shape in the space of power
injections (polytope or ellipsoid) and can be efficiently used for assessment
of system security in the presence of uncertainty. Efficiency and tightness of
the approach is validated on a number of test networks."
"Using state-space representation, mobile object positioning problems can be
described as dynamic systems, with the state representing the unknown location
and the observations being the information gathered from the location sensors.
For linear dynamic systems with Gaussian noise, the Kalman filter provides the
Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) state estimation by tracking the posterior.
Hence, by approximating non-Gaussian noise distributions with Gaussian Mixtures
(GM), a bank of Kalman filters or Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF), can provide the
MMSE state estimation. However, the MMSE itself is not analytically tractable.
Moreover, the general analytic bounds proposed in the literature are not
tractable for GM noise statistics. Hence, in this work, we evaluate the MMSE of
linear dynamic systems with GM noise statistics and propose its analytic lower
and upper bounds. We provide two analytic upper bounds which are the
Mean-Square Errors (MSE) of implementable filters, and we show that based on
the shape of the GM noise distributions, the tighter upper bound can be
selected. We also show that for highly multimodal GM noise distributions, the
bounds and the MMSE converge. Simulation results support the validity of the
proposed bounds and their behavior in limits."
"This paper presents an adaptive tracking control method for a class of
nonlinearly parameterized MIMO dynamic systems with time-varying delay and
unknown nonlinear dead-zone inputs. A new high dimensional integral
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced for the adaptive controller to
guarantee global stability of the considered systems and also ensure
convergence of the tracking errors to the origin. The proposed method provides
an alternative to existing methods used for MIMO time-delay systems with
dead-zone nonlinearities."
"Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formalism used to rigorously specify
requirements of cyberphysical systems (CPS), i.e., systems mixing digital or
discrete components in interaction with a continuous environment or analog com-
ponents. STL is naturally equipped with a quantitative semantics which can be
used for various purposes: from assessing the robustness of a specification to
guiding searches over the input and parameter space with the goal of falsifying
the given property over system behaviors. Algorithms have been proposed and
implemented for offline computation of such quantitative semantics, but only
few methods exist for an online setting, where one would want to monitor the
satisfaction of a formula during simulation. In this paper, we formalize a
semantics for robust online monitoring of partial traces, i.e., traces for
which there might not be enough data to decide the Boolean satisfaction (and to
compute its quantitative counterpart). We propose an efficient algorithm to
compute it and demonstrate its usage on two large scale real-world case studies
coming from the automotive domain and from CPS education in a Massively Open
Online Course (MOOC) setting. We show that savings in computationally expensive
simulations far outweigh any overheads incurred by an online approach."
"This paper puts forward the vision of fully decoupling market operations from
security considerations through controllable power flows. In ""A Fully
Controllable Power System"", power system security is no longer dependent on the
location of the power injection points. In the ideal case, this leads to the
elimination of redispatching costs, which amount to several million dollars per
year in large systems. This paper determines the upper and lower bounds for the
number of controllable lines and number of controllers to achieve this
decoupling in any system. It further introduces the notion of the
controllability vector CV, which expresses the effect of any controller on the
AC line flows. Based on two alternative definitions for controllability, two
controller placement algorithms to maximize controllability are presented and
their results are compared."
"The AC power flow equations underlie all operational aspects of power
systems. They are solved routinely in operational practice using the
Newton-Raphson method and its variants. These methods work well given a good
initial ""guess"" for the solution, which is always available in normal system
operations. However, with the increase in levels of intermittent generation,
the assumption of a good initial guess always being available is no longer
valid. In this paper, we solve this problem using the theory of monotone
operators. We show that it is possible to compute (using an offline
optimization) a ""monotonicity domain"" in the space of voltage phasors. Given
this domain, there is a simple efficient algorithm that will either find a
solution in the domain, or provably certify that no solutions exist in it. We
validate the approach on several IEEE test cases and demonstrate that the
offline optimization can be performed tractably and the computed ""monotonicity
domain"" includes all practically relevant power flow solutions."
"This paper investigates the state estimation of a high-fidelity spatially
resolved thermal- electrochemical lithium-ion battery model commonly referred
to as the pseudo two-dimensional model. The partial-differential algebraic
equations (PDAEs) constituting the model are spatially discretised using
Chebyshev orthogonal collocation enabling fast and accurate simulations up to
high C-rates. This implementation of the pseudo-2D model is then used in
combination with an extended Kalman filter algorithm for differential-algebraic
equations to estimate the states of the model. The state estimation algorithm
is able to rapidly recover the model states from current, voltage and
temperature measurements. Results show that the error on the state estimate
falls below 1 % in less than 200 s despite a 30 % error on battery initial
state-of-charge and additive measurement noise with 10 mV and 0.5 K standard
deviations."
"The AC power flow equations are fundamental in all aspects of power systems
planning and operations. They are routinely solved using Newton-Raphson like
methods. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when these
algorithms are guaranteed to find a solution of the power flow equations or how
long they may take to converge. Further, it is known that in general these
equations have multiple solutions and can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this
paper, we show that the power flow equations can be solved efficiently provided
that the solution lies in a certain set. We introduce a family of convex
domains, characterized by Linear Matrix Inequalities, in the space of voltages
such that there is at most one power flow solution in each of these domains.
Further, if a solution exists in one of these domains, it can be found
efficiently, and if one does not exist, a certificate of non-existence can also
be obtained efficiently. The approach is based on the theory of monotone
operators and related algorithms for solving variational inequalities involving
monotone operators. We validate our approach on IEEE test networks and show
that practical power flow solutions lie within an appropriately chosen convex
domain."
"In this paper, we address the problem of globally stabilizing a linear
time-invariant (LTI) system by means of a static feedback law whose amplitude
and successive time derivatives, up to a prescribed order $p$, are bounded by
arbitrary prescribed values. We solve this problem for two classes of LTI
systems, namely integrator chains and skew-symmetric systems with single input.
For the integrator chains, the solution we propose is based on the nested
saturations introduced by A.R. Teel. We show that this construction fails for
skew-symmetric systems and propose an alternative feedback law. We illustrate
these findings by the stabilization of the third order integrator with
prescribed bounds on the feedback and its first two derivatives, and similarly
for the harmonic oscillator with prescribed bounds on the feedback and its
first derivative."
"Smart environment applications demand novel solutions for managing quality of
services, especially availability and reliability at run-time. The underlying
systems are changing dynamically due to addition and removal of system
components, changing execution environments, and resources depletion.
Therefore, in such dynamic systems, the functionality and the performance of
smart environment applications can be hampered by faults. In this paper, we
follow a proactive approach to anticipate system state at runtime. We present a
proactive dependability framework to prevent faults at runtime based on
predictive analysis to increase availability and reliability of smart
environment applications, and reduce manual user interventions."
"In this paper, we consider stochastic optimal control of Markov Jump Linear
Systems with state feedback but without observation of the jumping parameter.
The proposed control law is assumed to be linear with constant gains that can
be obtained from the necessary optimality conditions using an iterative
algorithm. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a numerical example."
"In this paper, a synthesis method for distributed estimation is presented,
which is suitable for dealing with large-scale interconnected linear systems
with disturbance. The main feature of the proposed method is that local
estimators only estimate a reduced set of state variables and their complexity
does not increase with the size of the system. Nevertheless, the local
estimators are able to deal with lack of local detectability. Moreover, the
estimators guarantee H-infinity-performance of the estimates with respect to
model and measurement disturbances."
"We study the problem of finite-horizon probabilistic invariance for
discrete-time Markov processes over general (uncountable) state spaces. We
compute discrete-time, finite-state Markov chains as formal abstractions of
general Markov processes. Our abstraction differs from existing approaches in
two ways. First, we exploit the structure of the underlying Markov process to
compute the abstraction separately for each dimension. Second, we employ
dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) as compact representations of the abstraction.
In contrast, existing approaches represent and store the (exponentially large)
Markov chain explicitly, which leads to heavy memory requirements limiting the
application to models of dimension less than half, according to our
experiments. We show how to construct a DBN abstraction of a Markov process
satisfying an independence assumption on the driving process noise. We compute
a guaranteed bound on the error in the abstraction w.r.t.\ the probabilistic
invariance property; the dimension-dependent abstraction makes the error bounds
more precise than existing approaches. Additionally, we show how factor graphs
and the sum-product algorithm for DBNs can be used to solve the finite-horizon
probabilistic invariance problem. Together, DBN-based representations and
algorithms can be significantly more efficient than explicit representations of
Markov chains for abstracting and model checking structured Markov processes."
"In this work, we develop a novel fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme
for discrete-time two-dimensional (2D) systems that are represented by the
Fornasini-Marchesini model II (FMII). This is accomplished by generalizing the
basic invariant subspaces including unobservable, conditioned invariant and
unobservability subspaces of 1D systems to 2D models. These extensions have
been achieved and facilitated by representing a 2D model as an infinite
dimensional (Inf-D) system on a Banach vector space, and by particularly
constructing algorithms that compute these subspaces in a \emph{finite and
known} number of steps. By utilizing the introduced subspaces the FDI problem
is formulated and necessary and sufficient conditions for its solvability are
provided. Sufficient conditions for solvability of the FDI problem for 2D
systems using both deadbeat and LMI filters are also developed. Moreover, the
capabilities and advantages of our proposed approach are demonstrated by
performing an analytical comparison with the currently available 2D geometric
methods in the literature. Finally, numerical simulations corresponding to an
approximation of a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) system of a
heat exchanger, that is mathematically represented as a 2D model, have also
been provided."
"Life expectancy keeps growing and, among elderly people, accidental falls
occur frequently. A system able to promptly detect falls would help in reducing
the injuries that a fall could cause. Such a system should meet the needs of
the people to which is designed, so that it is actually used. In particular,
the system should be minimally invasive and inexpensive. Thanks to the fact
that most of the smartphones embed accelerometers and powerful processing unit,
they are good candidates both as data acquisition devices and as platforms to
host fall detection systems. For this reason, in the last years several fall
detection methods have been experimented on smartphone accelerometer data. Most
of them have been tuned with simulated falls because, to date, datasets of
real-world falls are not available. This article evaluates the effectiveness of
methods that detect falls as anomalies. To this end, we compared traditional
approaches with anomaly detectors. In particular, we experienced the kNN and
the SVM methods using both the one-class and two-classes configurations. The
comparison involved three different collections of accelerometer data, and four
different data representations. Empirical results demonstrated that, in most of
the cases, falls are not required to design an effective fall detector."
"In the context of Markov decision processes running in continuous time, one
of the most intriguing challenges is the efficient approximation of finite
horizon reachability objectives. A multitude of sophisticated model checking
algorithms have been proposed for this. However, no proper benchmarking has
been performed thus far.
  This paper presents a novel and yet simple solution: an algorithm originally
developed for a restricted subclass of models and a subclass of schedulers can
be twisted so as to become competitive with the more sophisticated algorithms
in full generality. As the second main contribution, we perform a comparative
evaluation of the core algorithmic concepts on an extensive set of benchmarks
varying over all key parameters: model size, amount of non-determinism, time
horizon, and precision."
"Positive systems are important class of dynamic systems with impressive
properties. The response of such systems to positive initial conditions and
positive inputs remain in the nonnegative orthant of the state space. Although
positive observers have been designed for positive systems, they are unable to
estimate the states when unknown inputs or disturbances are present in the
systems. This paper is a first attempt to design positive unknown input
observers (PUIO) for positive linear systems. The structural constraints on
observer parameters make the design task cumbersome. However, with the aid of a
positive stabilization scheme via LMI and by imposing conditions on positivity
of the generalized inverse associated with a certain design matrix, we provide
a reliable procedure for the design of PUIOs."
"Freight transportation is of outmost importance for our society and is
continuously increasing. At the same time, transporting goods on roads accounts
for about 26% of all energy consumption and 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions
in the European Union. Despite the influence the transportation system has on
our energy consumption and the environment, road transportation is mainly done
by individual long-haulage trucks with no real-time coordination or global
optimization. In this paper, we review how modern information and communication
technology supports a cyber-physical transportation system architecture with an
integrated logistic system coordinating fleets of trucks traveling together in
vehicle platoons. From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks traveling close
together can save about 10% of their fuel consumption. Utilizing road grade
information and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, a safe and fuel-optimized
cooperative look-ahead control strategy is implemented on top of the existing
cruise controller. By optimizing the interaction between vehicles and platoons
of vehicles, it is shown that significant improvements can be achieved. An
integrated transport planning and vehicle routing in the fleet management
system allows both small and large fleet owners to benefit from the
collaboration. A realistic case study with 200 heavy-duty vehicles performing
transportation tasks in Sweden is described. Simulations show overall fuel
savings at more than 5% thanks to coordinated platoon planning. It is also
illustrated how well the proposed cooperative look-ahead controller for
heavy-duty vehicle platoons manages to optimize the velocity profiles of the
vehicles over a hilly segment of the considered road network."
"The continuous evolution of a wide variety of systems, including
continuous-time Markov chains and linear hybrid automata, can be described in
terms of linear differential equations. In this paper we study the decision
problem of whether the solution $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ of a system of linear
differential equations $d\boldsymbol{x}/dt=A\boldsymbol{x}$ reaches a target
halfspace infinitely often. This recurrent reachability problem can
equivalently be formulated as the following Infinite Zeros Problem: does a
real-valued function $f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ satisfying a
given linear differential equation have infinitely many zeros? Our main
decidability result is that if the differential equation has order at most $7$,
then the Infinite Zeros Problem is decidable. On the other hand, we show that a
decision procedure for the Infinite Zeros Problem at order $9$ (and above)
would entail a major breakthrough in Diophantine Approximation, specifically an
algorithm for computing the Lagrange constants of arbitrary real algebraic
numbers to arbitrary precision."
"This paper provides a new observer design methodology for invariant systems
whose state evolves on a Lie group with outputs in a collection of related
homogeneous spaces and where the measurement of system input is corrupted by an
unknown constant bias. The key contribution of the paper is to study the
combined state and input bias estimation problem in the general setting of Lie
groups, a question for which only case studies of specific Lie groups are
currently available. We show that any candidate observer (with the same state
space dimension as the observed system) results in non-autonomous error
dynamics, except in the trivial case where the Lie-group is Abelian. This
precludes the application of the standard non-linear observer design
methodologies available in the literature and leads us to propose a new design
methodology based on employing invariant cost functions and general gain
mappings. We provide a rigorous and general stability analysis for the case
where the underlying Lie group allows a faithful matrix representation. We
demonstrate our theory in the example of rigid body pose estimation and show
that the proposed approach unifies two competing pose observers published in
prior literature."
"While sliding mode observers (SMOs) using discontinuous relays are widely
analyzed, most SMOs are implemented computationally using a continuous
approximation of the discontinuous relays. This approximation results in the
formation of a boundary layer in a neighborhood of the sliding manifold in the
observer error space. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop methods for
attenuating the effect of the boundary layer and guaranteeing performance
bounds on the resulting state estimation error. In this paper, a method is
proposed for constructing boundary-layer SMOs (BL-SMOs) with prescribed state
estimation error bounds. The BL-SMO formulation is then extended to
simultaneously estimate exogenous inputs (disturbance signals in the state and
output vector fields), along with the system state. Two numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
"Networked Automation Systems (NAS) have to meet stringent response time
during operation. Verifying response time of automation is an important step
during design phase before deployment. Timing discrepancies due to hardware,
software and communication components of NAS affect the response time. This
investigation uses model templates for verifying the response time in NAS.
First, jitter bounds model the timing fluctuations of NAS components. These
jitter bounds are the inputs to model templates that are formal models of
timing fluctuations. The model templates are atomic action patterns composed of
three composition operators- sequential, alternative, and parallel and embedded
in time wrapper that specifies clock driven activation conditions. Model
templates in conjunction with formal model of technical process offer an easier
way to verify the response time. The investigation demonstrates the proposed
verification method using an industrial steam boiler with typical NAS
components in plant floor."
"In this paper, we address a key issue of designing architectures and
algorithms which generate optimal demand response in a decentralized manner for
a smart-grid consisting of several stochastic renewables and dynamic loads. By
optimal demand response, we refer to the demand response which maximizes the
utility of the agents connected to the smart-grid. By decentralized we refer to
the desirable case where neither the independent system operator (ISO) needs to
know the dynamics/utilities of the agents, nor do the agents need to have a
knowledge of the dynamics/utilities of other agents connected to the grid. The
communication between the ISO and agents is restricted to the ISO announcing a
pricing policy and the agents responding with their energy
generation/consumption bids in response to the pricing policy.
  We provide a complete solution for both the deterministic and stochastic
cases. It features a price iteration scheme that results in optimality of
social welfare. We also provide an optimal solution for the case where there is
a common randomness affecting and observed by all agents. This solution can be
computationally complex, and we pose approximations. For the more general
partially observed randomness case, we exhibit a relaxation that significantly
reduces complexity. We also provide an approximation strategy that leads to a
model predictive control (MPC) approach. Simulation results comparing the
resulting optimal demand response with the existing architectures employed by
the ISO illustrate the benefit in social welfare utility realized by our
scheme. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work of its
kind to explicitly mark out the optimal response of dynamic demand."
"We study in this paper the problem of adaptive trajectory tracking for
nonlinear systems affine in the control with bounded state-dependent and
time-dependent uncertainties. We propose to use a modular approach, in the
sense that we first design a robust nonlinear state feedback which renders the
closed loop input to state stable(ISS) between an estimation error of the
uncertain parameters and an output tracking error. Next, we complement this
robust ISS controller with a model-free multiparametric extremum seeking (MES)
algorithm to estimate the model uncertainties. The combination of the ISS
feedback and the MES algorithm gives an indirect adaptive controller. We show
the efficiency of this approach on a two-link robot manipulator example."
"Modern society critically depends on the services electric power provides.
Power systems rely on a network of power lines and transformers to deliver
power from sources of power (generators) to the consumers (loads). However,
when power lines fail (for example, through lightning or natural disasters) or
when the system is heavily used, the network is often unable to fulfill all of
the demand for power. While systems are vulnerable to these failures,
increasingly, sophisticated control devices are being deployed to improve the
efficiency of power systems. Such devices can also be used to improve the
resiliency of power systems to failures. In this paper, we focus on using FACTS
devices in this context. A FACTS device allows power grid operators to adjust
the impedance parameters of power lines, thereby redistributing flow in the
network and potentially increasing the amount of power that is supplied. Here
we develop new approaches for determining the optimal parameter settings for
FACTS devices in order to supply the maximal amount of power when networks are
stressed, e.g. power line failures and heavy utilization."
"We present an optimization-based framework for analysis and control of linear
parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with spatially varying
coefficients without discretization or numerical approximation. For controller
synthesis, we consider both full-state feedback and point observation (output
feedback). The input occurs at the boundary (point actuation). We use positive
matrices to parameterize positive Lyapunov functions and polynomials to
parameterize controller and observer gains. We use duality and an invertible
state-variable transformation to convexify the controller synthesis problem.
Finally, we combine our synthesis condition with the Luenberger observer
framework to express the output feedback controller synthesis problem as a set
of LMI/SDP constraints. We perform an extensive set of numerical experiments to
demonstrate accuracy of the conditions and to prove necessity of the Lyapunov
structures chosen. We provide numerical and analytical comparisons with
alternative approaches to control including Sturm Liouville theory and
backstepping. Finally we use numerical tests to show that the method retains
its accuracy for alternative boundary conditions."
"Networked automation systems (NAS) are characterized by confluence of
control, computation, communication and Information (C3I) technologies. Design
decisions of one domain are affected by the constraints posed by others.
Reliable NAS design should address the requirements of the system, and
simultaneously meet the constraints posed by other domains and this is called
co-design in literature. Co-design requires clear definition of interfaces
among these domains. Control design in NAS is affected by the timing
imperfections posed by other domains. In this investigation, we first study the
different sources of timing imperfections in NAS, and classify them based on
their occurrence. The concept of jitter is used to define the timing
imperfections induced by various system components. Using this analysis, we
classify the jitter based on their behavior and domain of occurrence. Our
analysis shows that the jitter induced in NAS can be classified based on domain
as- hardware, software and communication. Next, we use this analysis to model
the jitter from the components of NAS. Modeling timing imperfections helps in
capturing the interfaces among the domains, and we use the concept of design
contracts to capture the interfaces. Design contracts describe the semantic
mapping among the domains and are specified using the jitter margins.
Implementing design contracts requires knowledge of the jitter margin and, the
results from control theory are used to this extent."
"This paper is focused on survival analysis of electrical components. The main
goal of this paper is to develop a method for on-line estimation of the Mean
Time To Failure (MTTF) of electrical components under dynamic stress levels.
The proposed method models the variations of the stress levels as a stochastic
process. Hence, a stochastic failure rate function can be developed for each
electrical component. Later, this function is used as the underlying rate of a
doubly stochastic Poisson process (known as Cox processes). Furthermore, this
Cox process is used for on-line estimation of the Mean Residual Life (MRL)
using the observed stress levels. The proposed method provides a good estimate
of the age and life expectancy of each component. An experimental case study is
provided to demonstrate the proposed method."
"The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has dramatically increased
the supply and lowered the cost of natural gas in the United States, driving an
expansion of natural gas-fired generation capacity in several electrical
inter-connections. Gas-fired generators have the capability to ramp quickly and
are often utilized by grid operators to balance intermittency caused by wind
generation. The time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying
natural gas consumption rates that impact the pressure and line-pack of the gas
network. As gas system operators assume nearly constant gas consumption when
estimating pipeline transfer capacity and for planning operations, such
fluctuations are a source of risk to their system. Here, we develop a new
method to assess this risk. We consider a model of gas networks with
consumption modeled through two components: forecasted consumption and small
spatio-temporarily varying consumption due to the gas-fired generators being
used to balance wind. While the forecasted consumption is globally balanced
over longer time scales, the fluctuating consumption causes pressure
fluctuations in the gas system to grow diffusively in time with a diffusion
rate sensitive to the steady but spatially-inhomogeneous forecasted
distribution of mass flow. To motivate our approach, we analyze the effect of
fluctuating gas consumption on a model of the Transco gas pipeline that extends
from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northeast of the United States."
"In this paper we consider the issue of reliability of measurements in
distributed adaptive estimation problem. To this aim, we assume a sensor
network with different observation noise variance among the sensors and propose
new estimation method based on incremental distributed least mean-square
(IDLMS) algorithm. The proposed method contains two phases: I) Estimation of
each sensors observation noise variance, and II) Estimation of the desired
parameter using the estimated observation variances. To deal with the
reliability of measurements, in the second phase of the proposed algorithm, the
step-size parameter is adjusted for each sensor according to its observation
noise variance. As our simulation results show, the proposed algorithm
considerably improves the performance of the IDLMS algorithm in the same
condition."
"In this paper we propose a novel partition-based distributed state estimation
scheme for non-overlapping subsystems based on Kalman filter. The estimation
scheme is designed in order to account, in a rigorous fashion, for dynamic
coupling terms between subsystems, and for the uncertainty related to the state
estimates performed by the neighboring subsystems. The online implementation of
the proposed estimation scheme is scalable, since it involves (i) small-scale
matrix operations to be carried out by the estimator embedded in each subsystem
and (ii) neighbor-to-neighbor transmission of a limited amount of data. We
provide theoretical conditions ensuring the estimation convergence.
Reconfigurability of the proposed estimation scheme is allowed in case of plug
and play operations. Simulation tests are provided to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
"Flexible joint robots, in particularly those which are equipped with
harmonic-drive gears, can feature elasticities with hysteresis. Under heavy
loads and large joint torques the hysteresis lost motion can lead to
significant errors of tracking and positioning of the robotic links. In this
paper, two approaches for compensating the nonlinear joint torsion with
hysteresis are described and compared with each other. Both methods assume the
measured signals available only on the motor side of joint transmissions. The
first approach assumes a rigid-link manipulator model and transforms the
desired link trajectory into that of the motor drives by using the inverse
dynamics and inverse hysteresis map. The second approach relies on the modeling
of motor drives and inverse hysteresis and uses the generalized momenta when
predicting the joint torsion. Both methods are discussed in details along with
a numerical example of two-link planar manipulator under gravity."
"We study incremental stability and convergence of switched (bimodal) Filippov
systems via contraction analysis. In particular, by using results on
regularization of switched dynamical systems, we derive sufficient conditions
for convergence of any two trajectories of the Filippov system between each
other within some region of interest. We then apply these conditions to the
study of different classes of Filippov systems including piecewise smooth (PWS)
systems, piecewise affine (PWA) systems and relay feedback systems. We show
that contrary to previous approaches, our conditions allow the system to be
studied in metrics other than the Euclidean norm. The theoretical results are
illustrated by numerical simulations on a set of representative examples that
confirm their effectiveness and ease of application."
"This paper focuses on the optimal sensor placement problem for the
identification of pipe failure locations in large-scale urban water systems.
The problem involves selecting the minimum number of sensors such that every
pipe failure can be uniquely localized. This problem can be viewed as a minimum
test cover (MTC) problem, which is NP-hard. We consider two approaches to
obtain approximate solutions to this problem. In the first approach, we
transform the MTC problem to a minimum set cover (MSC) problem and use the
greedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity property of the MSC problem to
compute the solution to the MTC problem. In the second approach, we develop a
new \textit{augmented greedy} algorithm for solving the MTC problem. This
approach does not require the transformation of the MTC to MSC. Our augmented
greedy algorithm provides in a significant computational improvement while
guaranteeing the same approximation ratio as the first approach. We propose
several metrics to evaluate the performance of the sensor placement designs.
Finally, we present detailed computational experiments for a number of real
water distribution networks."
"This paper is concerned with a binary detection problem over a non-secure
network. To satisfy the communication rate constraint and against possible
cyber attacks, which are modeled as deceptive signals injected to the network,
a likelihood ratio based (LRB) scheduler is designed in the sensor side to
smartly select sensor measurements for transmission. By exploring the
scheduler, some sensor measurements are successfully retrieved from the
attacked data at the decision center. We show that even under a moderate
communication rate constraint of secure networks, an optimal LRB scheduler can
achieve a comparable asymptotic detection performance to the standard N-P test
using the full set of measurements, and is strictly better than the random
scheduler. For non-secure networks, the LRB scheduler can also maintain the
detection functionality but suffers graceful performance degradation under
different attack intensities. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our
theoretical results."
"Composite adaptive control (CAC) that integrates direct and indirect adaptive
control techniques can achieve smaller tracking errors and faster parameter
convergence compared with direct and indirect adaptive control techniques.
However, the condition of persistent excitation (PE) still has to be satisfied
to guarantee parameter convergence in CAC. This paper proposes a novel model
reference composite learning control (MRCLC) strategy for a class of affine
nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties to guarantee parameter
convergence without the PE condition. In the composite learning, an integral
during a moving-time window is utilized to construct a prediction error, a
linear filter is applied to alleviate the derivation of plant states, and both
the tracking error and the prediction error are applied to update parametric
estimates. It is proven that the closed-loop system achieves global
exponential-like stability under interval excitation rather than PE of
regression functions. The effectiveness of the proposed MRCLC has been verified
by the application to an inverted pendulum control problem."
"This paper proposes a novel electric vehicle (EV) classification scheme for a
photovoltaic (PV) powered EV charging station (CS) that reduces the effect of
intermittency of electricity supply as well as reducing the cost of energy
trading of the CS. Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally
friendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium,
2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium
and conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their
batteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green
vehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce
its cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as
distributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of
EV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed
integer programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed
classification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be
effectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy
trading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data
are used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the
total cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles
increases, and also that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater
than those in summer."
"The calibration of a PointQ arterial microsimulation model is formulated as a
quadratic programming problem (QP) whose decision variables are link flows,
demands at entry links, and turn movements at intersections, subject to linear
constraints imposed by flow conservation identities and field measurements of a
subset of link flows (counts), demands and turn ratios. The quadratic objective
function is the deviation of the decision variables from their measured values.
The solution to the QP gives estimates of all unmeasured variables and thus
yields a fully specified simulation model. Runs of this simulation model can
then be compared with other field measurements, such as travel times along
routes, to judge the reliability of the calibrated model. A section of the
Huntington-Colorado arterial near I-210 in Los Angeles comprising 73 links and
16 intersections is used to illustrate the procedure. Two experiments are
conducted with the calibrated model to determine the maximum traffic that can
be diverted from the I-210 freeway to the arterial network, with and without
permitting changes in the timing plans. The maximum diversion in both cases is
obtained by solving a linear programming problem. A third experiment compares
the delay and travel time using the existing fixed time control and a max
pressure control. The fourth experiment compares two PointQ models: in the
first model the freeway traffic follows a pre-specified route while the
background traffic moves according to turn ratios, and in the second model turn
ratios are modified in a single commodity model to match the link flows. The
substantial modification of the turn ratios needed suggests that the use of a
single-commodity model as frequently done in CTM models can be misleading..."
"In this paper, a new model for traffic on roads with multiple lanes is
developed, where the vehicles do not adhere to a lane discipline. Assuming
identical vehicles, the dynamics is split along two independent directions: the
Y-axis representing the direction of motion and the X-axis representing the
lateral or the direction perpendicular to the direction of motion. Different
influence graphs are used to model the interaction between the vehicles in
these two directions. The instantaneous accelerations of each car, in both X
and Y directions, are functions of the measurements from the neighbouring cars
according to these influence graphs. The stability and equilibrium spacings of
the car formation is analyzed for usual traffic situations such as steady flow,
obstacles, lane changing and rogue drivers arbitrarily changing positions
inside the formation. Conditions are derived under which the formation
maintains stability and the desired intercar spacing for each of these traffic
events. Simulations for some of these scenarios are included."
"We present a new and efficient algorithm for determining a consensus value
for a network of agents. Different from existing algorithms, our algorithm
evaluates the consensus value for very large networks using heat kernel
pagerank. We consider two frameworks for the consensus problem, a weighted
average consensus among all agents, and consensus in a leader-following
formation. Using a heat kernel pagerank approximation, we give consensus
algorithms that run in time sublinear in the size of the network, and provide
quantitative analysis of the tradeoff between performance guarantees and error
estimates."
"We address a particular problem of output regulation for multi-input
multi-output nonlinear systems. Specifically, we are interested in making the
stability of an equilibrium point and the regulation to zero of an output,
robust to (small) unmodelled discrepancies between design model and actual
system in particular those introducing an offset. We propose a novel procedure
which is intended to be relevant to real life systems, as illustrated by a (non
academic) example."
"Contemporary electricity distribution systems are being challenged by the
variability of renewable energy sources. Slow response times and long energy
management periods cannot efficiently integrate intermittent renewable
generation and demand. Yet stochasticity can be judiciously coupled with system
flexibilities to enhance grid operation efficiency. Voltage magnitudes for
instance can transiently exceed regulation limits, while smart inverters can be
overloaded over short time intervals. To implement such a mode of operation, an
ergodic energy management framework is developed here. Considering a
distribution grid with distributed energy sources and a feed-in tariff program,
active power curtailment and reactive power compensation are formulated as a
stochastic optimization problem. Tighter operational constraints are enforced
in an average sense, while looser margins are enforced to be satisfied at all
times. Stochastic dual subgradient solvers are developed based on exact and
approximate grid models of varying complexity. Numerical tests on a real-world
56-bus distribution grid and the IEEE 123-bus test feeder relying on both grid
models corroborate the advantages of the novel schemes over their deterministic
alternatives."
"Due to the increasing concern for greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel
security, electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted much attention in recent
years. EVs can aggregate together constituting the vehicle-to-grid system.
Coordination of EVs is beneficial to the power system in many ways. In this
paper, we formulate a novel large-scale EV charging problem with energy trading
in order to maximize the aggregator profit. This problem is non-convex and can
be solved with a centralized iterative approach. To overcome the computation
complexity issue brought by the non-convexity, we develop a distributed
optimization-based heuristic. To evaluate our proposed approach, a modified
IEEE 118 bus testing system is employed with 10 aggregators serving 30 000 EVs.
The simulation results indicate that our proposed distributed heuristic with
energy trading can effectively increase the total profit of aggregators. In
addition, the proposed distributed optimization-based heuristic strategy can
achieve near-optimal performance."
"In this paper we study the problem of predictability in partially observable
discrete event systems, i.e., the question whether an observer can predict the
occurrence of a fault. We extend the definition of predictability to consider
the time interval where the fault will occur: the $(i,j)$-predictability does
not only specify that the fault will be predicted before it occurs, but also
that the predictor will be able to predict that its occurrence will occur in
$i$ to $j$ observations from now. We also provide a quadratic algorithm that
decides predictability of the system."
"Heart Rate Variability (HRV) plays an important role for reporting several
cardiological and non-cardiological diseases. Also, the HRV has a prognostic
value and is therefore quite important in modelling the cardiac risk. The
nature of the HRV is chaotic, stochastic and it remains highly controversial.
Because the HRV has utmost importance, it needs a sensitive tool to analyze the
variability. In previous work, Rosenstein and Wolf had used the Lyapunov
exponent as a quantitative measure for HRV detection sensitivity. However, the
two methods diverge in determining the HRV sensitivity. This paper introduces a
modification to both the Rosenstein and Wolf methods to overcome their
drawbacks. The introduced Mazhar-Eslam algorithm increases the sensitivity to
HRV detection with better accuracy."
"We consider the problem of modeling, estimating, and controlling the latent
state of a spatiotemporally evolving continuous function using very few sensor
measurements and actuator locations. Our solution to the problem consists of
two parts: a predictive model of functional evolution, and feedback based
estimator and controllers that can robustly recover the state of the model and
drive it to a desired function. We show that layering a dynamical systems prior
over temporal evolution of weights of a kernel model is a valid approach to
spatiotemporal modeling that leads to systems theoretic, control-usable,
predictive models. We provide sufficient conditions on the number of sensors
and actuators required to guarantee observability and controllability. The
approach is validated on a large real dataset, and in simulation for the
control of spatiotemporally evolving function."
"One of the main objectives of the smart grid initiative is to enable bulk
power transmission over long distance, with reduced transmission losses.
Besides the traditional high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) transmission,
with the advancement in power electronics, high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
transmission is increasingly becoming important. One of the main factors
impacting the transmission line parameters and the losses is the length of the
transmission line (overhead). In this paper, a concept of tuned high-voltage AC
line is presented for long (> 250 km) transmission line. A tuned line is where
the receiving-end voltage and current are numerically equal to the
corresponding sending-end values. This paper presents the detailed theoretical
analysis of the tuned HVAC line, suggesting adaptation of the transmission
frequency as per the length of the line. The simulation of a tuned HVAC line is
performed using the PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results for two different line
lengths, substantiate the theoretical analysis of reducing the reactive power
absorbed in the line, while increasing the active power transmission."
"The demand of electricity keeps increasing in this modern society and the
behavior of customers vary greatly from time to time, city to city, type to
type, etc. Generally, buildings are classified into residential, commercial and
industrial. This study is aimed to distinguish the types of residential
buildings in Singapore and establish a mathematical model to represent and
model the load profile of each type. Modeling household energy consumption is
the first step in exploring the possible demand response and load reduction
opportunities under the smart grid initiative. Residential electricity load
profiling includes the details on the electrical appliances, its energy
requirement, and consumption pattern. The model is generated with a bottom-up
load model. Simulation is performed for daily load profiles of 1 or 2 rooms, 3
rooms, 4 rooms and 5 rooms public housing. The simulated load profile is
successfully validated against the measured electricity consumption data, using
a web-based Customer Energy Portal (CEP) at the campus housings of Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore."
"This paper concerns a class of uncertain linear quantum systems subject to
quadratic perturbations in the system Hamiltonian. A small gain approach is
used to evaluate the performance of the given quantum system. In order to get
improved control performance, we propose two methods to design a coherent
controller for the system. One is to formulate a static quantum controller by
adding a controller Hamiltonian to the given system, and the other is to build
a dynamic quantum controller which is directly coupled to the given system.
Both controller design methods are given in terms of LMIs and a non-convex
equality. Hence, a rank constrained LMI method is used as a numerical
procedure. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the proposed methods
and also to make a performance comparison with different controller design
methods. Results show that for the same uncertain quantum system, the dynamic
quantum controller can offer an improvement in performance over the static
quantum controller."
"Voltage regulation is critical for power grids. However, it has become a much
more challenging problem as distributed energy resources (DERs) such as
photovoltaic and wind generators are increasingly deployed, causing rapid
voltage fluctuations beyond what can be handled by the traditional voltage
regulation methods. In this paper, motivated by two previously proposed
inverter-based local volt/var control algorithms, we propose a pseudo-gradient
based voltage control algorithm for the distribution network that does not
constrain the allowable control functions and has low implementation
complexity. We characterize the convergence of the proposed voltage control
scheme, and compare it against the two previous algorithms in terms of the
convergence condition as well as the convergence rate."
"We present a novel algorithm for reducing the state dimension, i.e. order, of
linear parameter varying (LPV) discrete-time state-space (SS) models with
affine dependence on the scheduling variable. The input-output behavior of the
reduced order model approximates that of the original model. In fact, for input
and scheduling sequences of a certain length, the input-output behaviors of the
reduced and original model coincide. The proposed method can also be
interpreted as a reachability and observability reduction (minimization)
procedure for LPV-SS representations with affine dependence."
"A novel approach to the problem of partial state estimation of nonlinear
systems is proposed. The main idea is to translate the state estimation problem
into one of estimation of constant, unknown parameters related to the systems
initial conditions. The class of systems for which the method is applicable is
identified via two assumptions related to the transformability of the system
into a suitable cascaded form and our ability to estimate the unknown
parameters. The first condition involves the solvability of a partial
differential equation while the second one requires some persistency of
excitation--like conditions. The proposed observer is shown to be applicable to
position estimation of a class of electromechanical systems, for the
reconstruction of the state of power converters and for speed observation of a
class of mechanical systems."
"The main objective of this paper is to propose an alternative procedure to
carry out one of the key steps of immersion and invariance stabilising
controller design. Namely, the one that ensures attractivity of the manifold
whose internal dynamics contains a copy of the desired system behaviour.
Towards this end we invoke contraction theory principles and ensure the
attractivity of the manifold rendering it horizontally contractive. The main
advantage of adopting this alternative approach is to make more systematic the
last step of the design with more explicit degrees of freedom to accomplish the
task. The classical case of systems in feedback form is used to illustrate the
proposed controller design."
"Ease of miniaturization and minimal maintenance are among the advantages for
replacing conventional batteries with vibratory energy harvesters in a wide of
range of disciplines and applications, from wireless communication sensors to
medical implants. However, the current harvesters do not extract energy from
the ambient vibrations in a very efficient and robust fashion, and hence, there
need to be more optimal harvesting approaches. In this paper, we introduce a
generic architecture for vibration energy harvesting and delineate the key
challenges in the field. Then, we formulate an optimal control problem to
maximize the harvested energy. Though possessing similar structure to that of
the standard LQG problem, this optimal control problem is inherently different
from the LQG problem and poses theoretical challenges to control community. As
the first step, we simplify it to a tractable problem of optimizing control
gains for a linear system subjected to Gaussian white noise excitation, and
show that this optimal problem has non-trivial optimal solutions in both time
and frequency domains."
"In this paper, a state-dependent control updating period framework is
proposed that leads to real-time implementable Model Predictive Control with
certified practical stability results and constraints satisfaction. The scheme
is illustrated and validated using new certification bound that is derived in
the case where the Fast Gradient iteration is used through a penalty method to
solve generally constrained convex optimization problems. Both the
certification bound computation and its use in the state-dependent updating
period framework are illustrated in the particular case of linear MPC. An
illustrative example involving a chain of four integrators is used to show the
explicit computation of the state-dependent control updating scheme."
"This paper studies quantized control for discrete-time piecewise affine
systems. For given stabilizing feedback controllers, we propose an encoding
strategy for local stability. If the quantized state is near the boundaries of
quantization regions, then the controller can recompute a better quantization
value. For the design of quantized feedback controllers, we also consider the
stabilization of piecewise affine systems with bounded disturbances. In order
to derive a less conservative design method with low computational cost, we
investigate a region to which the state belong in the next step."
"The development of algorithms for enhancing the resilience and efficiency of
the power grid requires performance evaluation with real topologies of power
transmission networks. However, due to security reasons, such topologies and
particularly the locations of the substations and the lines are usually not
publicly available. Therefore, we study the structural properties of the North
American grids and present an algorithm for generating synthetic spatially
embedded networks with similar properties to a given grid. The algorithm uses
the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for density estimation of the node positions
and generates a set of nodes with similar spatial distribution to the nodes in
a given network. Then, it uses two procedures, which are inspired by the
historical evolution of the grids, to connect the nodes. The algorithm has
several tunable parameters that allow generating grids similar to any given
grid. Particularly, we apply it to the Western Interconnection (WI) and to
grids that operate under the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) and the
Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC), and show that it generates
grids with similar structural and spatial properties to these grids. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider the spatial
distribution of the nodes and lines and its importance in generating synthetic
power grids."
"Although the kernel robust mixed-norm (KRMN) algorithm outperforms the kernel
least mean square (KLMS) algorithm in impulsive noise, it still has two major
problems as follows: (1) The choice of the mixing parameter in the KRMN is
crucial to obtain satisfactory performance. (2) The structure of the KRMN
algorithm grows linearly as the iteration goes on, thus it has high
computational complexity and memory requirement. To solve the parameter
selection problem, two variable-mixing parameter KRMN (VPKRMN) algorithms are
developed in this paper. Moreover, a sparsification algorithm, quantized VPKRMN
(QVPKRMN) algorithm is introduced for nonlinear system identification with
impulsive interferences. The energy conservation relation (ECR) and convergence
property of the QVPKRMN algorithm are analyzed. Simulation results in the
context of nonlinear system identification under impulsive interference
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed VPKRMN and QVPKRMN
algorithms as compared with the existing algorithms."
"The blocking problem naturally arises in transportation systems as multiple
vehicles with different itineraries share available resources. In this paper,
we investigate the impact of the blocking problem to the waiting time at the
intersections of transportation systems. We assume that different vehicles,
depending on their Internet connection capabilities, may communicate their
intentions (e.g., whether they will turn left or right or continue straight) to
intersections (specifically to devices attached to traffic lights). We consider
that information collected by these devices are transmitted to and processed in
a cloud-based traffic control system. Thus, a cloud-based system, based on the
intention information, can calculate average waiting times at intersections. We
consider this problem as a queuing model, and we characterize average waiting
times by taking into account (i) blocking probability, and (ii) vehicles'
ability to communicate their intentions. Then, by using average waiting times
at intersection, we develop a shortest delay algorithm that calculates the
routes with shortest delays between two points in a transportation network. Our
simulation results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate that our shortest
delay algorithm significantly improves over baselines that are unaware of the
blocking problem."
"The use of object oriented techniques and methodologies for the design of
real-time control systems appear to be necessary in order to deal with the
increasing complexity of such systems. Recently many object-oriented methods
have been used for the modeling and design of real-time control systems. We
believe that an approach that integrates the advancements in both object
modeling and design methods, and real-time scheduling theory is the key to
successful use of object oriented technology for real-time software. However,
past approaches to integrate the two either restrict the object models, or do
not allow sophisticated schedulability analysis techniques. In this paper we
show how schedulability analysis can be integrated with object-oriented design;
we develop the schedulability and feasibility analysis method for the external
messages that may suffer release jitter due to being dispatched by a tick
driven scheduler in real-time control system, and we also develop the
scheduliability method for sporadic activities, where message arrive
sporadically then execute periodically for some bounded time. This method can
be used to cope with timing constraints in complex real-time control systems."
"This paper extends applications of the quantum small gain and Popov methods
from existing results on robust stability to performance analysis results for a
class of uncertain quantum systems. This class of systems involves a nominal
linear quantum system and is subject to quadratic perturbations in the system
Hamiltonian. Based on these two methods, coherent guaranteed cost controllers
are designed for a given quantum system to achieve improved control
performance. An illustrative example also shows that the quantum Popov approach
can obtain less conservative results than the quantum small gain approach for
the same uncertain quantum system."
"This note further studies the previously proposed consensus protocol for
linear multi-agent systems with communication noises in [15], [16]. Each agent
is allowed to have its own time-varying gain to attenuate the effect of
communication noises. Therefore, the common assumption in most references that
all agents have the same noise-attenuation gain is not necessary. It has been
proved that if all noise-attenuation gains are infinitesimal of the same order,
then the mean square leader-following consensus can be reached. Furthermore,
the convergence rate of the multi-agent system has been investigated. If the
noise-attenuation gains belong to a class of functions which are bounded above
and below by $t^{-\beta}$ $(\beta\in(0,1))$ asymptotically, then the states of
all follower agents are convergent in mean square to the leader's state with
the rate characterized by a function bounded above by $t^{-\beta}$
asymptotically."
"This paper studies the problem of stabilizing target formations specified by
inter-neighbor bearings with relative position measurements. While the
undirected case has been studied in the existing works, this paper focuses on
the case where the interaction topology is directed. It is shown that a linear
distributed control law, which was proposed previously for undirected cases,
can still be applied to the directed case. The formation stability in the
directed case, however, relies on a new notion termed bearing persistence,
which describes whether or not the directed underlying graph is persistent with
the bearing rigidity of a formation. If a target formation is not bearing
persistent, undesired equilibriums will appear and global formation stability
cannot be guaranteed. The notion of bearing persistence is defined by the
bearing Laplacian matrix and illustrated by simulation examples."
"In this work, an $H_{\infty}$ performance fault recovery control problem for
a team of multi-agent systems that is subject to actuator faults is studied.
Our main objective is to design a distributed control reconfiguration strategy
such that \textbf{a)} in absence of disturbances the state consensus errors
either remain bounded or converge to zero asymptotically, \textbf{b)} in
presence of actuator fault the output of the faulty system behaves exactly the
same as that of the healthy system, and \textbf{c)} the specified $H_{\infty}$
performance bound is guaranteed to be minimized in presence of bounded energy
disturbances. The gains of the reconfigured control laws are selected first by
employing a geometric approach where a set of controllers guarantees that the
output of the faulty agent imitates that of the healthy agent and the consensus
achievement objectives are satisfied. Next, the remaining degrees of freedom in
the selection of the control law gains are used to minimize the bound on a
specified $H_{\infty}$ performance index. The effects of uncertainties and
imperfections in the FDI module decision in correctly estimating the fault
severity as well as delays in invoking the reconfigured control laws are
investigated and a bound on the maximum tolerable estimation uncertainties and
time delays are obtained. Our proposed distributed and cooperative control
recovery approach is applied to a team of five autonomous underwater vehicles
to demonstrate its capabilities and effectiveness in accomplishing the overall
team requirements subject to various actuator faults, delays in invoking the
recovery control, fault estimation and isolation imperfections and
unreliabilities under different control recovery scenarios."
"This paper addresses Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) of Large Power Systems
(LPS) subject to sensor failure. Hiding the fault from the controller allows
the nominal controller to remain in the loop. We assume specific faults that
violate observability of a subsystem, and we cannot rely on these faulty
subsystems when estimating states. We use a new method for reconfiguration
control of these faults that lead to unobservability of subsystems. The method
proposes augmenting a faulty subsystems with another subsystem(s) until a new
subsystem is achieved that is observable. Next, finding the best subsystems
among available candidates is considered and using structural analysis methods
and grammian definition, a complete algorithm is proposed for FTC of LPS. The
proposed approach is applied to the IEEE 14-bus test case and interactions are
considered in nonlinear form. Simulation results show that the proposed
approach works as intended."
"This paper considers the optimal control of time varying continuous time
Markov chains whose transition rates are themselves Markov processes. In one
set of problems the solution of an ordinary differential equation is shown to
determine the optimal performance and feedback controls, while some other cases
are shown to lead to singular optimal control problems which are more difficult
to solve. Solution techniques are demonstrated using examples from finance to
behavioral decision making."
"This paper studies the physical consequences of a class of unobservable
state-and-topology cyber-physical attacks in which both state and topology data
for a sub-network of the network are changed by an attacker to mask a physical
attack. The problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization problem which
aims to cause overload in a line of the network with limited attack resources.
It is shown that unobservable state-and-topology cyber-physical attacks as
studied in this paper can make the system operation more vulnerable to line
outages and failures."
"In this paper, we study the problem of stabilizing continuous-time switched
linear systems with quantized output feedback. We assume that the observer and
the control gain are given for each mode. Also, the plant mode is known to the
controller and the quantizer. Extending the result in the non-switched case, we
develop an update rule of the quantizer to achieve asymptotic stability of the
closed-loop system under the average dwell-time assumption. To avoid quantizer
saturation, we adjust the quantizer at every switching time."
"We propose a stability analysis method for sampled-data switched linear
systems with finite-level static quantizers. In the closed-loop system,
information on the active mode of the plant is transmitted to the controller
only at each sampling time. This limitation of switching information leads to a
mode mismatch between the plant and the controller, and the system may become
unstable. A mode mismatch also makes it difficult to find an attractor set to
which the state trajectory converges. A switching condition for stability is
characterized by the total time when the modes of the plant and the controller
are different. Under the condition, we derive an ultimate bound on the state
trajectories by using a common Lyapunov function computed from a randomized
algorithm. The switching condition can be reduced to a dwell-time condition."
"We present one of the first algorithms on model based reinforcement learning
and trajectory optimization with free final time horizon. Grounded on the
optimal control theory and Dynamic Programming, we derive a set of backward
differential equations that propagate the value function and provide the
optimal control policy and the optimal time horizon. The resulting policy
generalizes previous results in model based trajectory optimization. Our
analysis shows that the proposed algorithm recovers the theoretical optimal
solution on linear low dimensional problem. Finally we provide application
results on nonlinear systems."
"Many nonlinear dynamical systems can be written as Lure systems, which are
described by a linear time-invariant system interconnected with a diagonal
static sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions are derived for the
global asymptotic stability analysis of discrete-time Lure systems in which the
nonlinearities have restricted slope and/or are odd, which is the usual case in
real applications. A Lure-Postnikov-type Lyapunov function is proposed that is
used to derive sufficient analysis conditions in terms of linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs). The derived stability critera are provably less
conservative than criteria published in the literature, with numerical examples
indicating that conservatism can be reduced by orders of magnitude."
"A novel adaptive control approach is proposed to solve the globally
asymptotic state stabilization problem for uncertain pure-feedback nonlinear
systems which can be transformed into the pseudo-affine form. The pseudo-affine
pure-feedback nonlinear system under consideration is with non-linearly
parameterised uncertainties and possibly unknown control coefficients. Based on
the parameter separation technique, a backstepping controller is designed by
adopting the adaptive high gain idea. The rigorous stability analysis shows
that the proposed controller could guarantee, for any initial system condition,
boundedness of the closed-loop signals and globally asymptotic stabilization of
the state. A numerical and a realistic examples are employed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed control method."
"A novel control design approach for general nonlinear systems is described in
this paper. The approach is based on the identification of a polynomial model
of the system to control and on the on-line inversion of this model. Extensive
simulations are carried out to test the numerical efficiency of the approach.
Numerical examples of applicative interest are presented, concerned with
control of the Duffing oscillator, control of a robot manipulator and insulin
regulation in a type 1 diabetic patient."
"We present a data-driven optimal control framework that can be viewed as a
generalization of the path integral (PI) control approach. We find iterative
feedback control laws without parameterization based on probabilistic
representation of learned dynamics model. The proposed algorithm operates in a
forward-backward manner which differentiate from other PI-related methods that
perform forward sampling to find optimal controls. Our method uses
significantly less samples to find optimal controls compared to other
approaches within the PI control family that relies on extensive sampling from
given dynamics models or trials on physical systems in model-free fashions. In
addition, the learned controllers can be generalized to new tasks without
re-sampling based on the compositionality theory for the linearly-solvable
optimal control framework. We provide experimental results on three different
systems and comparisons with state-of-the-art model-based methods to
demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of the proposed framework."
"This paper considers a class of uncertain linear quantum systems subject to
uncertain perturbations in the system Hamiltonian. We present a method to
design a coherent robust H-infinity controller so that the closed loop system
is robustly stable and achieves a prescribed level of disturbance attenuation
with all the admissible uncertainties. An illustrative example shows that for
the given system, the method presented in this paper has improved performance
over the existing quantum H-infinity control results without considering
uncertainty."
"This article deals with input-to-state stability (ISS) of discrete-time
switched systems. Given a family of nonlinear systems with exogenous inputs, we
present a class of switching signals under which the resulting switched system
is ISS. We allow non-ISS systems in the family and our analysis involves
graph-theoretic arguments. A weighted digraph is associated to the switched
system, and a switching signal is expressed as an infinite walk on this
digraph, both in a natural way. Our class of stabilizing switching signals
(infinite walks) is periodic in nature and affords simple algorithmic
construction."
"A new way to design parameter estimators with enhanced performance is
proposed in the paper. The procedure consists of two stages, first, the
generation of new regression forms via the application of a dynamic operator to
the original regression. Second, a suitable mix of these new regressors to
obtain the final desired regression form. For classical linear regression forms
the procedure yields a new parameter estimator whose convergence is established
without the usual requirement of regressor persistency of excitation. The
technique is also applied to nonlinear regressions with ""partially"" monotonic
parameter dependence---giving rise again to estimators with enhanced
performance. Simulation results illustrate the advantages of the proposed
procedure in both scenarios."
"This paper studies Gramian-based reachability metrics for bilinear control
systems. In the context of complex networks, bilinear systems capture scenarios
where an actuator not only can affect the state of a node but also
interconnections among nodes. Under the assumption that the input's infinity
norm is bounded by some function of the network dynamic matrices, we derive a
Gramian-based lower bound on the minimum input energy required to steer the
state from the origin to any reachable target state. This result motivates our
study of various objects associated to the reachability Gramian to quantify the
ease of controllability of the bilinear network: the minimum eigenvalue
(worst-case minimum input energy to reach a state), the trace (average minimum
input energy to reach a state), and its determinant (volume of the ellipsoid
containing the reachable states using control inputs with no more than unit
energy). We establish an increasing returns property of the reachability
Gramian as a function of the actuators, which in turn allows us to derive a
general lower bound on the reachability metrics in terms of the aggregate
contribution of the individual actuators. We conclude by examining the effect
on the worst-case minimum input energy of the addition of bilinear inputs to
difficult-to-control linear symmetric networks. We show that the bilinear
networks resulting from the addition of either inputs at a finite number of
interconnections or at all self loops with weight vanishing with the network
scale remain difficult-to-control. Various examples illustrate our results."
"SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is concerned with gathering
process information from industrial control processes found in utilities such
as power grids, water networks, transportation, manufacturing, etc., to provide
the human operators with the required real-time access to industrial processes
to be monitored and controlled either locally (on-site)or remotely (i.e.,
through Internet). Conventional solutions such as custom SCADA packages, custom
communication protocols, and centralized architectures are no longer
appropriate for engineering this type of systems because of their highly
distribution and their uncertain continuously changing working environments.
Multi-agent systems (MAS) appeared as a new architectural style for engineering
complex and highly dynamic applications such as SCADA systems. In this paper,
we propose an approach for simply developing flexible and interoperable SCADA
systems based on the integration of MAS and OPC process protocol. The proposed
SCADA system has the following advantages: 1) simple (easier to be
implemented); 2) flexible (able to adapt to its environment dynamic changes);
and 3) interoperable (relative to the underlying control systems, which belongs
to diverse of vendors). The applicability of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by a real case study example carried out in a paper mill."
"This work develops a measurement-driven and model-based formal verification
approach, applicable to systems with partly unknown dynamics. We provide a
principled method, grounded on reachability analysis and on Bayesian inference,
to compute the confidence that a physical system driven by external inputs and
accessed under noisy measurements, verifies a temporal logic property. A case
study is discussed, where we investigate the bounded- and unbounded-time safety
of a partly unknown linear time invariant system."
"Current state-of-the-art correct-by-design controllers are designed for
full-state measurable systems. This work first extends the applicability of
correct-by-design controllers to partially observable LTI systems. Leveraging
2nd order bounds we give a design method that has a quantifiable robustness to
probabilistic disturbances on state transitions and on output measurements. In
a case study from smart buildings we evaluate the new output-based
correct-by-design controller on a physical system with limited sensor
information."
"We investigate the problem of synthesizing switching controllers for
stabilizing continuous-time plants. First, we introduce a class of control
Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for switched systems along with a switching strategy
that yields a closed loop system with a guaranteed minimum dwell time in each
switching mode. However, the challenge lies in automatically synthesizing
appropriate CLFs. Assuming a given fixed form for the CLF with unknown
coefficients, we derive quantified nonlinear constraints whose feasible
solutions (if any) correspond to CLFs for the original system. However, solving
quantified nonlinear constraints pose a challenge to most LMI/BMI-based
relaxations. Therefore, we investigate a general approach called
Counter-Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), that has been widely used
in the emerging area of automatic program synthesis. We show how a LMI-based
relaxation can be formulated within the CEGIS framework for synthesizing CLFs.
We also evaluate our approach on a number of interesting benchmarks, and
compare the performance of the new approach with our previous work that uses
off-the-shelf nonlinear constraint solvers instead of the LMI relaxation. The
results shows synthesizing CLFs by using LMI solvers inside a CEGIS framework
can be a computational feasible approach to synthesizing CLFs."
"This note addresses the output synchronization problem of incrementally
output-feedback passive nonlinear systems in the presence of exogenous
disturbances. Two kinds of distributed controllers are proposed; one placed at
the nodes and the other placed at the edges. Each of them is synthesized based
on the adaptive control method to cope with the shortage of passivity, and on
the internal model principle to deal with the disturbances. The proposed
controllers synchronize the outputs of the nonlinear systems when the solution
of the closed-loop system is bounded. Based on this, we present a class of
systems for which boundedness of the solutions is guaranteed. The analysis used
in this note is also applicable to a case where systems are coupled via links
modeled by dynamical systems. Simulation results of a network of Van der Pol
oscillators show the effectiveness of the proposed methods."
"In this paper we present a model predictive control (MPC) approach to
optimize vehicle scheduling and routing in an autonomous mobility-on-demand
(AMoD) system. In AMoD systems, robotic, self-driving vehicles transport
customers within an urban environment and are coordinated to optimize service
throughout the entire network. Specifically, we first propose a novel
discrete-time model of an AMoD system and we show that this formulation allows
the easy integration of a number of real-world constraints, e.g., electric
vehicle charging constraints. Second, leveraging our model, we design a model
predictive control algorithm for the optimal coordination of an AMoD system and
prove its stability in the sense of Lyapunov. At each optimization step, the
vehicle scheduling and routing problem is solved as a mixed integer linear
program (MILP) where the decision variables are binary variables representing
whether a vehicle will 1) wait at a station, 2) service a customer, or 3)
rebalance to another station. Finally, by using real-world data, we show that
the MPC algorithm can be run in real-time for moderately-sized systems and
outperforms previous control strategies for AMoD systems."
"In this paper, we consider the problem of synthesizing
correct-by-construction controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. A
commonly adopted approach in the literature is to abstract the dynamical system
into a Finite Transition System (FTS) and thus convert the problem into a two
player game between the environment and the system on the FTS. The controller
design problem can then be solved using synthesis tools for general linear
temporal logic or generalized reactivity(1) specifications. In this article, we
propose a new abstraction algorithm. Instead of generating a single FTS to
represent the system, we generate two FTSs, which are under- and
over-approximations of the original dynamical system. We further develop an
iterative abstraction scheme by exploiting the concept of winning sets, i.e.,
the sets of states for which there exists a winning strategy for the system.
Finally, the efficiency of the new abstraction algorithm is illustrated by
numerical examples."
"We present a controller synthesis algorithm for reach-avoid problems for
piecewise linear discrete-time systems. Our algorithm relies on SMT solvers and
in this paper we focus on piecewise constant control strategies. Our algorithm
generates feedback control laws together with inductive proofs of unbounded
time safety and progress properties with respect to the reach-avoid sets. Under
a reasonable robustness assump- tion, the algorithm is shown to be complete.
That is, it either generates a controller of the above type along with a proof
of correctness, or it establishes the impossibility of the existence of such
controllers. To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively attempts to solve a
weakened and strengthened versions of the SMT encoding of the reach-avoid
problem. We present preliminary experimental results on applying this algorithm
based on a prototype implementation."
"In developing countries, night driving is extremely unsafe mainly due to; 1).
Poorly followed traffic rules and 2) bad road conditions. The number of
accidents is increasing at a frightening pace, necessitating the development of
a low cost automatic headlight control system to ensure safety. In most
accident cases, fatal collisions take place due to glare generated by excessive
headlight intensity (high beam) of the oncoming vehicle. In this paper, a user
friendly controller for headlight intensity control for driving on highway at
night has been proposed. Aim is to design simple and affordable system that can
alleviate effect of blind spot due to high glare on the vehicle windscreen.
Controller is based on Fuzzy inference system (FIS) and used incoming light
intensity as criteria. Also, relative distance and speed is derived using
incoming intensity of the oncoming vehicles. The system is designed considering
human tolerance levels of light intensity as the boundary values. The system
controls headlight beam voltage such that; a) intensity is maintained in human
visual comfort zone and b) blind spot is avoided. The super user feature
incorporated in the intensity controller offers personalized preferences to the
driver. Due to the use of the single parameter (intensity) for control, system
can be implemented using simplified hardware."
"We propose a macroscopic modeling framework for a network of roads and
multi-commodity traffic. The proposed framework is based on the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards kinematic wave theory; more precisely, on its
discretization, the Cell Transmission Model (CTM), adapted for networks and
multi-commodity traffic. The resulting model is called the Link-Node CTM
(LNCTM).
  In the LNCTM, we use the fundamental diagram of an ""inverse lambda"" shape
that allows modeling of the capacity drop and the hysteresis behavior of the
traffic state in a link that goes from free flow to congestion and back.
  A model of the node with multiple input and multiple output links accepting
multi-commodity traffic is a cornerstone of the LNCTM. We present the
multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) node model for multi-commodity traffic that
supersedes previously developed node models. The analysis and comparison with
previous node models are provided.
  Sometimes, certain traffic commodities may choose between multiple output
links in a node based on the current traffic state of the node's input and
output links. For such situations, we propose a local traffic assignment
algorithm that computes how incoming traffic of a certain commodity should be
distributed between output links, if this information is not known a priori."
"In this paper, we propose a new method to identify biochemical reaction
networks (i.e. both reactions and kinetic parameters) from heterogeneous
datasets. Such datasets can contain (a) data from several replicates of an
experiment performed on a biological system; (b) data measured from a
biochemical network subjected to different experimental conditions, for
example, changes/perturbations in biological inductions, temperature, gene
knock-out, gene over-expression, etc. Simultaneous integration of various
datasets to perform system identification has the potential to avoid
non-identifiability issues typically arising when only single datasets are
used."
"This paper presents a generalized energy storage system model for voltage and
angle stability analysis. The proposed solution allows modeling most common
energy storage technologies through a given set of linear differential
algebraic equations (DAEs). In particular, the paper considers, but is not
limited to, compressed air, superconducting magnetic, electrochemical capacitor
and battery energy storage devices. While able to cope with a variety of
different technologies, the proposed generalized model proves to be accurate
for angle and voltage stability analysis, as it includes a balanced,
fundamental-frequency model of the voltage source converter (VSC) and the
dynamics of the dc link. Regulators with inclusion of hard limits are also
taken into account. The transient behavior of the generalized model is compared
with detailed fundamental-frequency balanced models as well as commonly-used
simplified models of energy storage devices. A comprehensive case study based
on the WSCC 9-bus test system is presented and discussed."
"Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems consume almost half
of the total energy use of commercial buildings. To optimize HVAC energy usage,
it is important to understand the energy consumption of individual HVAC
components at fine granularities. However, buildings typically only have
aggregate building level power and thermal meters. We present HVACMeter, a
system which leverages existing sensors in commercial HVAC systems to estimate
the energy consumed by individual components of the HVAC system, as well by
each thermal zone in buildings. HVACMeter can be generalized to any HVAC system
as it uses the basic understanding of HVAC operation, heat transfer equations,
and historical sensor data to estimate energy. We deploy HVACMeter to three
buildings on our campus, to identify the set of sensors that are important for
accurately disaggregating energy use at the level of each Air Handler Unit and
each thermal zone within these buildings. HVACMeter power estimations have on
an average 44.5 % less RMSE than that of mean power estimates. Furthermore, we
highlight the usefulness of HVACMeter energy estimation model for a building
fault detection application by quantifying the amount of energy that can be
saved by fixing particular faults."
"Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to
distributed control of discrete-event systems. Its essence is the allocation of
monolithic (global) control action among the local control strategies of
individual agents. In this paper, we extend supervisor localization by
considering partial observation; namely not all events are observable.
Specifically, we employ the recently proposed concept of relative observability
to compute a partial-observation monolithic supervisor, and then design a
suitable localization procedure to decompose the supervisor into a set of local
controllers. In the resulting local controllers, only observable events can
cause state change. Further, to deal with large-scale systems, we combine the
partial-observation supervisor localization with an efficient architectural
synthesis approach: first compute a heterarchical array of partial-observation
decentralized supervisors and coordinators, and then localize each of these
supervisors/coordinators into local controllers."
"Inspired by the recent developments in the fields of quantum distributed
computing, quantum systems are analyzed as networks of quantum nodes to reduce
the complexity of the analysis. This gives rise to the distributed quantum
consensus algorithms. Focus of this paper is on optimizing the convergence rate
of the continuous time quantum consensus algorithm over a quantum network with
$N$ qudits. It is shown that the optimal convergence rate is independent of the
value of $d$ in qudits. First by classifying the induced graphs as the Schreier
graphs, they are categorized in terms of the partitions of integer $N$. Then
establishing the intertwining relation between one level dominant partitions in
the Hasse Diagram of integer $N$, it is proved that the spectrum of the induced
graph corresponding to the dominant partition is included in that of the less
dominant partition. Based on this result, the proof of the Aldous' conjecture
is extended to all possible induced graphs and the original optimization
problem is reduced to optimizing spectral gap of the smallest induced graph. By
providing the analytical solution to semidefinite programming formulation of
the obtained problem, closed-form expressions for the optimal results are
provided for a wide range of topologies."
"In this paper, we consider the distributed robust filtering problem, where
estimator design is based on a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs). We separate the problem and show that the method of multipliers can be
applied to obtain a solution efficiently and in a decentralized fashion, i.e.
all local estimators can compute their filter gains locally and iteratively,
with communications restricted to their neighbours. The convergence properties
of the iterative algorithm are analyzed and interpreted."
"This paper reviews research that studies the principle of self-support (PSS)
in some control systems and proposes a fractional-order generalized PSS
framework for the first time. The existing PSS approach focuses on practical
tracking problem of integer-order systems including robotic dynamics, high
precision linear motor system, multi-axis high precision positioning system
with unmeasurable variables, imprecise sensor information, uncertain parameters
and external disturbances. More generally, by formulating the fractional PSS
concept as a new generalized framework, we will focus in the possible fields on
the fractional-order control problems such as practical tracking,
$\lambda$-tracking, etc. of robot systems, multiple mobile agents, discrete
dynamical systems, time delay systems and other uncertain nonlinear systems.
Finally, the practical tracking of a first-order uncertain model of automobile
is considered as a simple example to demonstrate the efficiency of the
fractional-order generalized principle of self-support (FOGPSS) control
strategy."
"This paper presents two case studies where a macroscopic model-based approach
for traffic state estimation, which we have recently developed, is employed and
tested. The estimation methodology is developed for a ""mixed"" traffic scenario,
where traffic is composed of both ordinary and connected vehicles. Only average
speed measurements, which may be obtained from connected vehicles reports, and
a minimum number (sufficient to guarantee observability) of spot sensor-based
total flow measurements are utilised. In the first case study, we use NGSIM
microscopic data in order to test the capability of estimating the traffic
state on the basis of aggregated information retrieved from moving vehicles and
considering various penetration rates of connected vehicles. In the second case
study, a longer highway stretch with internal congestion is utilised, in order
to test the capability of the proposed estimation scheme to produce appropriate
estimates for varying traffic conditions on long stretches. In both cases the
performances are satisfactory, and the obtained results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the methodology, both in qualitative and quantitative terms."
"In this paper, the tracking control problem of a class of uncertain
Euler-Lagrange systems subjected to unknown input delay and bounded
disturbances is addressed. To this front, a novel delay dependent control law,
referred as Adaptive Robust Outer Loop Control (AROLC) is proposed. Compared to
the conventional predictor based approaches, the proposed controller is capable
of negotiating any input delay, within a stipulated range, without knowing the
delay or its variation. The maximum allowable input delay is computed through
Razumikhin-type stability analysis. AROLC also provides robustness against the
disturbances due to input delay, parametric variations and unmodelled dynamics
through switching control law. The novel adaptive law allows the switching gain
to modify itself online in accordance with the tracking error without any
prerequisite of the uncertainties. The uncertain system, employing AROLC, is
shown to be Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB). As a proof of concept,
experimentation is carried out on a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot with
various time varying as well as fixed input delay, and better tracking accuracy
of the proposed controller is noted compared to predictor based methodology."
"In this paper the problem of driving the state of a network of identical
agents, modeled by boundary-controlled heat equations, towards a common
steady-state profile is addressed. Decentralized consensus protocols are
proposed to address two distinct problems. The first problem is that of
steering the states of all agents towards the same constant steady-state
profile which corresponds to the spatial average of the agents initial
condition. A linear local interaction rule addressing this requirement is
given. The second problem deals with the case where the controlled boundaries
of the agents dynamics are corrupted by additive persistent disturbances. To
achieve synchronization between agents, while completely rejecting the effect
of the boundary disturbances, a nonlinear sliding-mode based consensus protocol
is proposed. Performance of the proposed local interaction rules are analyzed
by applying a Lyapunov-based approach. Simulation results are presented to
support the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."
"In this paper, the tracking control problem of a class of Euler-Lagrange
systems subjected to unknown uncertainties is addressed and an adaptive-robust
control strategy, christened as Time-Delayed Adaptive Robust Control (TARC) is
presented. The proposed control strategy approximates the unknown dynamics
through time-delayed logic, and the switching logic provides robustness against
the approximation error. The novel adaptation law for the switching gain, in
contrast to the conventional adaptive-robust control methodologies, does not
require either nominal modelling or predefined bounds of the uncertainties.
Also, the proposed adaptive law circumvents the overestimation-underestimation
problem of switching gain. The state derivatives in the proposed control law is
estimated from past data of the state to alleviate the measurement error when
state derivatives are not available directly. Moreover, a new stability notion
for time-delayed control is proposed which in turn provides a selection
criterion for controller gain and sampling interval. Experimental result of the
proposed methodology using a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is
presented and improved tracking accuracy of the proposed control law is noted
compared to time-delayed control and adaptive sliding mode control."
"This paper derives analytical closed-form expressions that uncover the
contributions of nodal active- and reactive-power injections to the active- and
reactive-power flows on transmission lines in an AC electrical network. Paying
due homage to current- and voltage-divider laws that are similar in spirit, we
baptize these as the power divider laws. Derived from a circuit-theoretic
examination of AC power-flow expressions, the constitution of the power divider
laws reflects the topology and voltage profile of the network. We demonstrate
the utility of the power divider laws to the analysis of power networks by
highlighting applications to transmission-network allocation, transmission-loss
allocation, and identifying feasible injections while respecting line
active-power flow set points."
"We study in this paper the problem of adaptive trajectory tracking control
for a class of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties. We propose to
use a modular approach, where we first design a robust nonlinear state feedback
which renders the closed loop input-to-state stable (ISS), where the input is
considered to be the estimation error of the uncertain parameters, and the
state is considered to be the closed-loop output tracking error. Next, we
augment this robust ISS controller with a model-free learning algorithm to
estimate the model uncertainties. We implement this method with two different
learning approaches. The first one is a model-free multi-parametric extremum
seeking (MES) method and the second is a Bayesian optimization-based method
called Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB). The combination of the
ISS feedback and the learning algorithms gives a learning-based modular
indirect adaptive controller. We show the efficiency of this approach on a
two-link robot manipulator example."
"Sparse adaptive filtering has gained much attention due to its wide
applicability in the field of signal processing. Among the main algorithm
families, sparse norm constraint adaptive filters develop rapidly in recent
years. However, when applied for system identification, most priori work in
sparse norm constraint adaptive filtering suffers from the difficulty of
adaptability to the sparsity of the systems to be identified. To address this
problem, we propose a novel variable p-norm constraint least mean square (LMS)
algorithm, which serves as a variant of the conventional Lp-LMS algorithm
established for sparse system identification. The parameter p is iteratively
adjusted by the gradient descent method applied to the instantaneous square
error. Numerical simulations show that this new approach achieves better
performance than the traditional Lp-LMS and LMS algorithms in terms of
steady-state error and convergence rate."
"In this paper, we propose a new design method of discrete-valued control for
continuous-time linear time-invariant systems based on sum-of-absolute-values
(SOAV) optimization. We first formulate the discrete-valued control design as a
finite-horizon SOAV optimal control, which is an extended version of L1 optimal
control. We then give simple conditions that guarantee the existence,
discreteness, and uniqueness of the SOAV optimal control. Also, we give the
continuity property of the value function, by which we prove the stability of
infinite-horizon model predictive SOAV control systems. We provide a fast
algorithm for the SOAV optimization based on the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM), which has an important advantage in real-time control
computation. A simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed
method."
"In this paper, we study attitude synchronization for elements in the unit
sphere of R3 and for elements in the 3D rotation group, for a network with
switching topology. The agents angular velocities are assumed to be the control
inputs, and a switching control law for each agent is devised that guarantees
synchronization, provided that all elements are initially contained in a given
region, unknown to the network. The control law is decentralized and it does
not require a common orientation frame among all agents. We refer to
synchronization of unit vectors in R3 as incomplete synchronization, and of 3D
rotation matrices as complete synchronization. Our main contribution lies on
showing that these two problems can be analyzed under a common framework, where
all elements' dynamics are transformed into unit vectors dynamics on a sphere
of appropriate dimension."
"This paper investigates a decentralized optimization methodology to
coordinate Electric Vehicles (EV) charging in order to contribute to the
voltage control on a residential electrical distribution feeder. This aims to
maintain the voltage level in function of the EV's power injection using the
sensitivity matrix approach. The decentralized optimization is tested with two
different methods, respectively global and local, when EV take into account
their impact on all the nodes of the network or only on a local neighborhood of
their connection point. EV can also update their decisions asynchronously or
synchronously. While only the global approach with asynchronous update is
theoretically proven to converge, using results from game theory, simulations
show the potential of other algorithms for which fewer iterations or fewer
informations are necessary. Finally, using Monte Carlo simulations over a wide
range of EV localization configurations, the first analysis have also shown a
promising performance in comparison with uncoordinated charging or with a
""voltage droop charging control"" recently proposed in the literature."
"The inference and the verification of numerical relationships among variables
of a program is one of the main goals of static analysis. In this paper, we
propose an Abstract Interpretation framework based on higher-dimensional
ellipsoids to automatically discover symbolic quadratic invariants within
loops, using loop counters as implicit parameters. In order to obtain
non-trivial invariants, the diameter of the set of values taken by the
numerical variables of the program has to evolve (sub-)linearly during loop
iterations. These invariants are called ellipsoidal cones and can be seen as an
extension of constructs used in the static analysis of digital filters.
Semidefinite programming is used to both compute the numerical results of the
domain operations and provide proofs (witnesses) of their correctness."
"In this paper a design of a master-slave microgrid consisting of
grid-supporting current source inverters and a synchronous generator is
proposed. The inverters are following the frequency of the grid imposed by the
synchronous generator. Hence, the proposed structure of the microgrid is
steadily synchronized. We show that the method achieves power sharing without
the need of communication. Furthermore, no change in operation mode is needed
during transitions of the microgrid between islanded and grid-connected modes."
"In this paper the problem of cooperative task planning of multi-agent systems
when timed constraints are imposed to the system is investigated. We consider
timed constraints given by Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL). We propose a
method for automatic control synthesis in a two-stage systematic procedure.
With this method we guarantee that all the agents satisfy their own individual
task specifications as well as that the team satisfies a team global task
specification."
"Distributed multi-task adaptive strategies are useful to estimate multiple
parameter vectors simultaneously in a collaborative manner. The existed
distributed multi-task strategies use diffusion mode of cooperation in which
during adaptation step each node gets the cooperation from it neighborhood
nodes but not in the same cluster and during combining step each node combines
the intermediate estimates of it neighboring nodes that belong to the same
cluster. For this the nodes need to transmit the intermediate estimates to its
neighborhood. In this paper we propose an extension to the multi-task diffusion
affine projection algorithm by allowing partial sharing of the entries of the
intermediate estimates among the neighbors. The proposed algorithm is termed as
multi-task Partial diffusion Affine projection Algorithm (multi-task Pd-APA)
which can provide the trade-off between the communication performance and the
estimation performance. The performance analysis of the proposed multi-task
partial diffusion APA algorithm is studied in mean and mean square sense.
Simulations were conducted to verify the analytical results."
"Waveform design is a pivotal component of the fully adaptive radar construct.
In this paper we consider waveform design for radar space time adaptive
processing (STAP), accounting for the waveform dependence of the clutter
correlation matrix. Due to this dependence, in general, the joint problem of
receiver filter optimization and radar waveform design becomes an intractable,
non-convex optimization problem, Nevertheless, it is however shown to be
individually convex either in the filter or in the waveform variables. We
derive constrained versions of: a) the alternating minimization algorithm, b)
proximal alternating minimization, and c) the constant modulus alternating
minimization, which, at each step, iteratively optimizes either the STAP filter
or the waveform independently. A fast and slow time model permits waveform
design in radar STAP but the primary bottleneck is the computational complexity
of the algorithms."
"The growing amount of intermittent renewables in power generation creates
challenges for real-time matching of supply and demand in the power grid.
Emerging ancillary power markets provide new incentives to consumers (e.g.,
electrical vehicles, data centers, and others) to perform demand response to
help stabilize the electricity grid. A promising class of potential demand
response providers includes energy storage systems (ESSs). This paper evaluates
the benefits of using various types of novel ESS technologies for a variety of
emerging smart grid demand response programs, such as regulation services
reserves (RSRs), contingency reserves, and peak shaving. We model, formulate
and solve optimization problems to maximize the net profit of ESSs in providing
each demand response. Our solution selects the optimal power and energy
capacities of the ESS, determines the optimal reserve value to provide as well
as the ESS real-time operational policy for program participation. Our results
highlight that applying ultra-capacitors and flywheels in RSR has the potential
to be up to 30 times more profitable than using common battery technologies
such as LI and LA batteries for peak shaving."
"We consider a smart-grid connecting several agents, modeled as stochastic
dynamical systems, who may be electricity consumers/producers. At each discrete
time instant, which may represent a 15 minute interval, each agent may
consume/generate some quantity of electrical energy. The Independent System
Operator (ISO) is given the task of assigning consumptions/generations to the
agents so as to maximize the sum of the utilities accrued to the agents,
subject to the constraint that energy generation equals consumption at each
time.
  This task of coordinating generation and demand has to be accomplished by the
ISO without the agents revealing their system states, dynamics, or utility/cost
functions. We show how and when a simple iterative procedure converges to the
optimal solution. The ISO iteratively obtains electricity bids by the agents,
and declares the tentative market clearing prices. In response to these prices,
the agents submit new bids.
  On the demand side, the solution yields an optimal demand response for
dynamic and stochastic loads. On the generation side, it provides the optimal
utilization of stochastically varying renewables such as solar/wind, and
generation with fossil fuel based generation with dynamic constraints such as
ramping rates. Thereby we solve a decentralized stochastic control problem,
without agents sharing any information about their system models, states or
utility functions."
"We study a distributed node-specific parameter estimation problem where each
node in a wireless sensor network is interested in the simultaneous estimation
of different vectors of parameters that can be of local interest, of common
interest to a subset of nodes, or of global interest to the whole network. We
assume a setting where the nodes do not know which other nodes share the same
estimation interests. First, we conduct a theoretical analysis on the
asymptotic bias that results in case the nodes blindly process all the local
estimates of all their neighbors to solve their own node-specific parameter
estimation problem. Next, we propose an unsupervised diffusion-based LMS
algorithm that allows each node to obtain unbiased estimates of its
node-specific vector of parameters by continuously identifying which of the
neighboring local estimates correspond to each of its own estimation tasks.
Finally, simulation experiments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed
strategy."
"The performance, reliability, cost, size and energy usage of computing
systems can be improved by one or more orders of magnitude by the systematic
use of modern control and optimization methods. Computing systems rely on the
use of feedback algorithms to schedule tasks, data and resources, but the
models that are used to design these algorithms are validated using open-loop
metrics. By using closed-loop metrics instead, such as the gap metric developed
in the control community, it should be possible to develop improved scheduling
algorithms and computing systems that have not been over-engineered.
Furthermore, scheduling problems are most naturally formulated as constraint
satisfaction or mathematical optimization problems, but these are seldom
implemented using state of the art numerical methods, nor do they explicitly
take into account the fact that the scheduling problem itself takes time to
solve. This paper makes the case that recent results in real-time model
predictive control, where optimization problems are solved in order to control
a process that evolves in time, are likely to form the basis of scheduling
algorithms of the future. We therefore outline some of the research problems
and opportunities that could arise by explicitly considering feedback and time
when designing optimal scheduling algorithms for computing systems."
"We consider baseband equivalent representation of transmission circuits, in
the form of a nonlinear dynamical system $\mathbf S$ in discrete time (DT)
defined by a series interconnection of a phase-amplitude modulator, a nonlinear
dynamical system $\mathbf F$ in continuous time (CT), and an ideal demodulator.
We show that when $\mathbf F$ is a CT Volterra series model, the resulting
$\mathbf S$ is a series interconnection of a DT Volterra series model of same
degree and memory depth, and an LTI system with special properties. The result
suggests a new, non-obvious, analytically motivated structure of digital
pre-compensation of analog nonlinear distortions such as those caused by power
amplifiers in digital communication systems. The baseband model and the
corresponding digital compensation structure readily extend to OFDM modulation.
MATLAB simulation is used to verify proposed baseband equivalent model and
demonstrate effectiveness of the new compensation scheme, as compared to the
standard Volterra series approach."
"A variety of control systems have been proposed for aircraft autopilot
systems. Traditional approaches such as proportional controller and
conventional PID (CPID) controller are widely used. PID controller has a good
static performance especially for linear and time-invariant systems, but a weak
dynamic performance and discouraging function on nonlinear, time-varying, and
uncertain systems. Fuzzy control theory can improve dynamic response in various
conditions of system performance. This paper designs fuzzy self-tuning PID
(FSPID) controller to improve disadvantages of conventional PID in aircraft
autopilots. We apply proposed controller to pitch angle of aircraft then the
abilities of proposed controller will be compared to the conventional PID and
proportional controller. Inner feedback loop acts as oscillation damper in
traditional schemes, but here is removed to compare the capabilities of Fuzzy
self-tuning PID, conventional PID, and proportional controller. Based on the
simulations, both of Conventional and Fuzzy self-tuning PID controllers can
properly damp oscillations in lack of the inner feedback loop, but proportional
controller cannot do. Then short-period approximation is assumed to assess the
function of FSPID and CPID controllers in confront with abrupt and continuous
disturbances, in addition to inappropriate tuning of parameters. Simulation
results of short-period approximation show a better anti-disturbance function
for Fuzzy self-tuning PID compare to the conventional type. Fuzzy self-tuning
PID can tune the PID parameters for achieving the optimal response in view of
speed, overshoot, and steady-state error in conditions of inappropriate tuning
of PID parameters, based on the results of simulation in short-period
approximation, the proposed controller can adaptively improve the system
response by on-line setting of PID parameters."
"We present a closed form expression for the information matrix associated
with the Wiener model identification problem under the assumption that the
input signal is a stationary Gaussian process. This expression holds under
quite generic assumptions. We allow the linear sub-system to have a rational
transfer function of arbitrary order, and the static nonlinearity to be a
polynomial of arbitrary degree. We also present a simple expression for the
determinant of the information matrix. The expressions presented herein has
been used for optimal experiment design for Wiener model identification."
"This paper introduces a Global Positioning System (GPS) Receiver that locates
user's position instantly. Recently, many mobile devices require location
information to add user position into their contents, and some applications
require quick positioning when the device is initially switched on. In order to
reduce the time to fix user's position, we propose the Instant-On GPS receiver
system which is implemented on an ARM based FPGA board, and operates under a
very low power mode. We've developed a repeated sleep mode by periods to
control the GPS receiver's main power in order to achieve reduced power
consumption. By using a high resolution Real Time Clock (RTC), we can estimate
frame sync timing without receiving the current frame sync preamble data from a
satellite when GPS turns back on. However, the navigation solution needs to be
calculated once in advance. The performance results of the proposed GPS
receiver in both real world and simulation environment are presented."
"This paper is concerned with the analysis and design of secure Distributed
Control Systems in the face of integrity attacks on sensors and controllers by
external attackers or insiders. In general a DCS consists of many heterogenous
components and agents including sensors, actuators, controllers. Due to its
distributed nature, some agents may start misbehaving to disrupt the system.
This paper first reviews necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic
detection of integrity attacks carried out by any number of malicious agents,
based on the concept of left invertibility of structural control systems. It
then develops a notion equivalent to structural left invertibility in terms of
vertex separators of a graph. This tool is then leveraged to design minimal
communication networks for DCSs, which ensure that an adversary cannot generate
undetectable attacks. Numerical examples are included to illustrate these
results."
"Recently, a new approach to the adaptive control of linear time-invariant
plants with unknown parameters (referred to as second level adaptation), was
introduced by Han and Narendra in [1]. Based on $N (\geq m+1)$ fixed or
adaptive models of the plant, where $m$ is the dimension of the unknown
parameter vector, an unknown parameter vector $\alpha\in R^{N}$ is estimated in
the new approach, and in turn, is used to control the overall system.
Simulation studies were presented in [1] to demonstrate that the new method is
significantly better than those that are currently in use.
  In this paper, we undertake a more detailed examination of the theoretical
and practical advantages claimed for the new method. In particular, the need
for many models, the proof of stability, and the improvement in performance and
robustness are explored in depth both theoretically and experimentally."
"This paper investigates distributed angular frequency regulation of
multi-machine power systems with wind generations when wind power signals'
frequencies are known (and unknown). The challenge is to regulate angular
frequencies under fast changing and unpredictable wind generations. To address
the issue, we split unknown signals into three parts according to their
frequency ranges and design an (adaptive) internal model to reconstruct the low
and medium frequency parts. We integrate heterogeneous grid components to deal
with fast changing signals. At each bus with wind power generations, a battery
energy storage system is used to filter out high frequency components of wind
generations. At generator bus, demand response is utilized to deal with their
medium frequency components and a synchronous generator is exploited to handle
their low frequency components. At load bus, demand response handles low and
medium frequency components. The proposed controllers ensure exponential
stability (and asymptotic convergence) of system states with respect to their
desired signals. Simulations on the IEEE 68-bus test system are conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers."
"We study distributed network flows as solvers in continuous time for the
linear algebraic equation $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{H}\mathbf{y}$. Each node $i$ has
access to a row $\mathbf{h}_i^{\rm T}$ of the matrix $\mathbf{H}$ and the
corresponding entry $z_i$ in the vector $\mathbf{z}$. The first ""consensus +
projection"" flow under investigation consists of two terms, one from standard
consensus dynamics and the other contributing to projection onto each affine
subspace specified by the $\mathbf{h}_i$ and $z_i$. The second ""projection
consensus"" flow on the other hand simply replaces the relative state feedback
in consensus dynamics with projected relative state feedback. Without
dwell-time assumption on switching graphs as well as without positively lower
bounded assumption on arc weights, we prove that all node states converge to a
common solution of the linear algebraic equation, if there is any. The
convergence is global for the ""consensus + projection"" flow while local for the
""projection consensus"" flow in the sense that the initial values must lie on
the affine subspaces. If the linear equation has no exact solutions, we show
that the node states can converge to a ball around the least squares solution
whose radius can be made arbitrarily small through selecting a sufficiently
large gain for the ""consensus + projection"" flow under fixed bidirectional
graphs. Semi-global convergence to approximate least squares solutions is
demonstrated for general switching directed graphs under suitable conditions.
It is also shown that the ""projection consensus"" flow drives the average of the
node states to the least squares solution with complete graph. Numerical
examples are provided as illustrations of the established results."
"Motivated by the recent advances in the field of quantum computing, quantum
systems are modelled and analyzed as networks of decentralized quantum nodes
which employ distributed quantum consensus algorithms for coordination. In the
literature, both continuous and discrete time models have been proposed for
analyzing these algorithms. This paper aims at optimizing the convergence rate
of the discrete time quantum consensus algorithm over a quantum network with
$N$ qudits. The induced graphs are categorized in terms of the partitions of
integer $N$ by arranging them as the Schreier graphs. It is shown that the
original optimization problem reduces to optimizing the Second Largest
Eigenvalue Modulus (SLEM) of the weight matrix. Exploiting the Specht module
representation of partitions of $N$, the Aldous' conjecture is generalized to
all partitions (except ($N$)) in the Hasse diagram of integer $N$. Based on
this result, it is shown that the spectral gap of Laplacian of all induced
graphs corresponding to partitions (other than ($N$)) of $N$ are the same,
while the spectral radius of the Laplacian is obtained from the feasible least
dominant partition in the Hasse diagram of integer $N$. The semidefinite
programming formulation of the problem is addressed analytically for $N \leq
d^2 + 1$ and a wide range of topologies where closed-form expressions for the
optimal results are provided. For a quantum network with complete graph
topology, solution of the optimization problem based on group association
schemes is provided for all values of $N$."
"This is a complete version of the 6-page IEEE TAC technical note [1]. In this
paper, we consider the distributed surrounding of a convex target set by a
group of agents with switching communication graphs. We propose a distributed
controller to surround a given set with the same distance and desired
projection angles specified by a complex-value adjacency matrix. Under mild
connectivity assumptions, we give results in both consistent and inconsistent
cases for the set surrounding in a plane. Also, we provide sufficient
conditions for the multi-agent coordination when the convex set contains only
the origin."
"We construct a trajectory tracking controller for a quadrotor system by
finding a coordinate change which transforms the quadrotor's vector field into
that of a thrust propelled system. In a thrust propelled system, the goal is to
stabilize its position around the origin, while the system is actuated by a one
dimensional acceleration/thrust along a direction vector, by a time-varying
gravity, and by the angular acceleration of the direction vector. For this
system, a solution has been proposed in a companion article, submitted to ECC
2016, based on the implicit knowledge of a bounded controller for a double
integrator system, and on the implicit knowledge of a Lyapunov function that
guarantees the origin is asymptotically stable for the double integrator
controlled by the bounded controller. We present two alternative bounded
controllers for a double integrator system, and corresponding Lyapunov
functions."
"In this article, the problem of synthesizing switching controllers is
considered through the synthesis of a ""control certificate"". Control
certificates include control barrier and Lyapunov functions, which represent
control strategies, and allow for automatic controller synthesis. Our approach
encodes the controller synthesis problem as quantified nonlinear constraints.
We extend an approach called Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS),
originally proposed for program synthesis problems, to solve the resulting
constraints. The CEGIS procedure involves the use of satisfiability-modulo
theory (SMT) solvers to automate the problem of synthesizing control
certificates. In this paper, we examine generalizations of CEGIS to attempt a
richer class of specifications, including reach-while-stay with obstacles and
control under disturbances. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to
handle systems with nonpolynomial dynamics as well. The abilities of our
general framework are demonstrated through a set of interesting examples. Our
evaluation suggests that our approach is computationally feasible, and adds to
the growing body of formal approaches to controller synthesis."
"We consider the fuel-optimal coordination of trucks into platoons. Truck
platooning is a promising technology that enables trucks to save significant
amounts of fuel by driving close together and thus reducing air drag. We study
how fuel-optimal speed profiles for platooning can be computed. A first-order
fuel model is considered and pairwise optimal plans are derived. We formulate
an optimization problem that combines these pairwise plans into an overall plan
for a large number of trucks. The problem resembles a medoids clustering
problem. We propose an approximation algorithm similar to the partitioning
around medoids algorithm and discuss its convergence. The method is evaluated
with Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
compute a plan for thousands of trucks and that significant fuel savings can be
achieved."
"This paper investigates the observability of one of the most commonly used
equivalent circuit models (ECMs) for lithium-ion batteries and presents a
method to estimate the state of charge (SOC) in the presence of sensor biases,
highlighting the importance of observability analysis for choosing appropriate
state estimation algorithms. Using a differential geometric approach, necessary
and sufficient conditions for the nonlinear ECM to be observable are derived
and are shown to be different from the conditions for the observability of the
linearised model. It is then demonstrated that biases in the measurements, due
to sensor ageing or calibration errors, can be estimated by applying a
nonlinear Kalman filter to an augmented model where the biases are incorporated
into the state vector. Experiments are carried out on a lithium-ion pouch cell
and three types of nonlinear filters, the first-order extended Kalman filter
(EKF), the second-order EKF and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are applied
using experimental data. The different performances of the filters are
explained from the point of view of observability."
"Platooning is a way to significantly reduce fuel consumption of trucks.
Vehicles that drive at close inter-vehicle distance assisted by automatic
controllers experience substantially lower air-drag. In this paper, we deal
with the problem of coordinating the formation and the breakup of platoons in a
fuel-optimal way. We formulate an optimization problem which accounts for
routing, speed-dependent fuel consumption, and platooning decisions. An
algorithm to obtain an approximate solution to the problem is presented. It
first determines the shortest path for each truck. Then, possible platoon
configurations are identified. For a certain platoon configuration the optimal
speed profile is the solution to a convex program. The algorithm is illustrated
by a realistic example."
"In an age of ever-increasing penetration of GPS-enabled mobile devices, the
potential of real-time ""probe"" location information for estimating the state of
transportation networks is receiving increasing attention. Much work has been
done on using probe data to estimate the current speed of vehicle traffic (or
equivalently, trip travel time). While travel times are useful to individual
drivers, the state variable for a large class of traffic models and control
algorithms is vehicle density. Our goal is to use probe data to supplement
traditional, fixed-location loop detector data for density estimation. To this
end, we derive a method based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters, a
sequential Monte Carlo scheme. We present a simulation where we obtain a 30\%
reduction in density mean absolute percentage error from fusing loop and probe
data, vs. using loop data alone. We also present results using real data from a
19-mile freeway section in Los Angeles, California, where we obtain a 31\%
reduction. In addition, our method's estimate when using only the real-world
probe data, and no loop data, outperformed the estimate produced when only loop
data were used (an 18\% reduction). These results demonstrate that probe data
can be used for traffic density estimation."
"This paper describes the application of stochastic grey-box modeling to
identify electrical power consumption-to-temperature models of a domestic
freezer using experimental measurements. The models are formulated using
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), estimated by maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE), validated through the model residuals analysis and
cross-validated to detect model over-fitting. A nonlinear model based on the
reversed Carnot cycle is also presented and included in the modeling
performance analysis. As an application of the models, we apply model
predictive control (MPC) to shift the electricity consumption of a freezer in
demand response experiments, thereby addressing the model selection problem
also from the application point of view and showing in an experimental context
the ability of MPC to exploit the freezer as a demand side resource (DSR)."
"In this paper, we design a supervisor to prevent vehicle collisions at
intersections. An intersection is modeled as an area containing multiple
conflict points where vehicle paths cross in the future. At every time step,
the supervisor determines whether there will be more than one vehicle in the
vicinity of a conflict point at the same time. If there is, then an impending
collision is detected, and the supervisor overrides the drivers to avoid
collision. A major challenge in the design of a supervisor as opposed to an
autonomous vehicle controller is to verify whether future collisions will occur
based on the current drivers choices. This verification problem is particularly
hard due to the large number of vehicles often involved in intersection
collision, to the multitude of conflict points, and to the vehicles dynamics.
In order to solve the verification problem, we translate the problem to a
job-shop scheduling problem that yields equivalent answers. The job-shop
scheduling problem can, in turn, be transformed into a mixed-integer linear
program when the vehicle dynamics are first-order dynamics, and can thus be
solved by using a commercial solver."
"In the formal approach to reactive controller synthesis, a symbolic
controller for a possibly hybrid system is obtained by algorithmically
computing a winning strategy in a two-player game. Such game-solving algorithms
scale poorly as the size of the game graph increases. However, in many
applications, the game graph has a natural hierarchical structure. In this
paper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits
this hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis.
  We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism which
decomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First,
the construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers,
where each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is
decomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the
higher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the
state space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis
problems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional
requirements on lower-level local games.
  Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for
local game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible
winning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of
environment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies
due to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step
of the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller
constructs a play which satisfies all local specifications. We illustrate our
results through an example controlling an autonomous robot in a known,
multistory building."
"Traditional emergency control schemes in power systems usually accompany with
power interruption yielding severely economic damages to customers. This paper
sketches the ideas of a viable alternative for traditional remedial controls
for power grids with high penetration of renewables, in which the renewables
are integrated with synchronverters to mimic the dynamics of conventional
generators. In this novel emergency control scheme, the power electronics
resources are exploited to control the inertia and damping of the imitated
generators in order to quickly compensate for the deviations caused by fault
and thereby bound the fault-on dynamics and stabilize the power system under
emergency situations. This emergency control not only saves investments and
operating costs for modern and future power systems, but also helps to offer
seamless electricity service to customers. Simple numerical simulation will be
used to illustrate the concept of this paper."
"Energy management of plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) has different
challenges from non-plug-in HEVs, due to bigger batteries and grid recharging.
Instead of tackling it to pursue energetic efficiency, an approach minimizing
the driving cost incurred by the user - the combined costs of fuel, grid energy
and battery degradation - is here proposed. A real-time approximation of the
resulting optimal policy is then provided, as well as some analytic insight
into its dependence on the system parameters. The advantages of the proposed
formulation and the effectiveness of the real-time strategy are shown by means
of a thorough simulation campaign."
"In this paper, a hybrid measurement and model-based method is proposed which
can estimate the dynamic state Jacobian matrix in near real-time. The proposed
method is computationally efficient and robust to the variation of network
topology. Since the estimated Jacobian matrix carries significant information
on system dynamics and states, it can be utilized in various applications. In
particular, two application of the estimated Jacobian matrix in online
oscillation analysis, stability monitoring and control are illustrated with
numerical examples. In addition, a side-product of the proposed method can
facilitate model validation by approximating the damping of generators."
"In this paper, we provide an extension of the scalable algorithm proposed in
(Riverso et al., 2015) for the design of Plug-and-Play (PnP) controllers for AC
Islanded microGrids (ImGs). The method in (Riverso et al., 2015) assumes DGUs
are arranged in a load-connected topology, i.e. loads can appear only at the
output terminals of inverters. For handling totally general interconnections of
DGUs and loads, we describe an approach based on Kron Reduction (KR), a network
reduction method giving an equivalent load-connected model of the original ImG.
However, existing KR approaches can fail in preserving the structure of
transfer functions representing transmission lines. To avoid this drawback, we
introduce an approximate KR algorithm, still capable to represent exactly the
asymptotic periodic behavior of electric signals even if they are unbalanced.
Our results are backed up with simulations illustrating features of the new KR
approach as well as its use for designing PnP controllers in a 21-bus ImG
derived from an IEEE test feeder."
"This paper proposes a hybrid approach to optimal day-ahead pricing for demand
response management. At the customer-side, compared with the existing work, a
detailed, comprehensive and complete energy management system, which includes
all possible types of appliances, all possible applications, and an effective
waiting time cost model is proposed to manage the energy usages in households
(lower level problem). At the retailer-side, the best retail prices are
determined to maximize the retailer's profit (upper level problem). The
interactions between the electricity retailer and its customers can be cast as
a bilevel optimization problem. To overcome the weakness and infeasibility of
conventional Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) approach for this particular type of
bilevel problem, a hybrid pricing optimization approach, which adopts the
multi-population genetic algorithms for the upper level problem and distributed
individual optimization algorithms for the lower level problem, is proposed.
Numerical results show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed
approach and its benefit to the retailer and its customers by improving the
retailer's profit and reducing the customers' bills."
"In this paper, we propose a method to establish a networked control system
that maintains its stability in the presence of certain undesirable incidents
on local controllers. We call such networked control systems weakly resilient.
We first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the weak resilience of
networked systems. Networked systems do not generally satisfy this condition.
Therefore, we provide a method for designing a compensator which ensures the
weak resilience of the compensated system. Finally, we illustrate the
efficiency of the proposed method by a power system example based on the IEEE
14-bus test system."
"In this paper we present a switching control strategy to incrementally
stabilize a class of nonlinear dynamical systems. Exploiting recent results on
contraction analysis of switched Filippov systems derived using regularization,
sufficient conditions are presented to prove incremental stability of the
closed-loop system. Furthermore, based on these sufficient conditions, a design
procedure is proposed to design a switched control action that is active only
where the open-loop system is not sufficiently incrementally stable in order to
reduce the required control effort. The design procedure to either locally or
globally incrementally stabilize a dynamical system is then illustrated by
means of a representative example."
"We introduce a novel distributed control architecture for heterogeneous
platoons of linear time--invariant autonomous vehicles. Our approach is based
on a generalization of the concept of {\em leader--follower} controllers for
which we provide a Youla--like parameterization while the sparsity constraints
are imposed on the controller's left coprime factors, outlying a new concept of
structural constraints in distributed control. The proposed scheme is amenable
to optimal controller design via norm based costs, it guarantees string
stability and eliminates the accordion effect from the behavior of the platoon.
We also introduce a synchronization mechanism for the exact compensation of the
time delays induced by the wireless broadcasting of information."
"In the semiconductor manufacturing batch processes, each step is a
complicated physiochemical batch process; generally it is difficult to perform
measurements online or carry out the measurement for each run, and hence there
will be delays in the feedback of the system. The effect of the delay on the
stability of the system is an important issue which needs to be understood.
Based on the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) algorithm, we propose
two kinds of controllers, EWMA-I and II controllers for single product process
and mixed product process in semiconductor manufacturing in this paper. For the
single product process, the stabilities of systems with both controllers which
undergo different kinds of metrology delays are investigated. Necessary and
sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability are established.
Routh-Hurwitz criterion and Lyapunov's direct method are used to obtain the
stability regions for the system with fixed metrology delay. By using
Lyapunov's direct method, the stability region is established for the system
with fixed sampling metrology and with stochastic metrology delay. We also
extended the theorems of single product process to mixed product process. Based
on the proposed theorems, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate
the stability of the delay system."
"This paper proposes a new time-scaling approach for computational optimal
control of a distributed parameter system governed by the Saint-Venant PDEs. We
propose the time-scaling approach, which can change a uniform time partition to
a nonuniform one. We also derive the gradient formulas by using the variational
method. Then the method of lines (MOL) is applied to compute the Saint-Venant
PDEs after implementing the time-scaling transformation and the associate
costate PDEs. Finally, we compare the optimization results using the proposed
time-scaling approach with the one not using it. The simulation result
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed time-scaling method."
"Dynamic surface control (DSC) method uses high gain filters to avoid the
""explosion of complexity"" issue inherent in backstepping based controller
designs. As a result, the closed loop system and filter dynamics possess time
scale separation between them. This paper attempts to design a novel
disturbance observer based dynamic surface controller using contraction
framework. In doing so the steady state error bounds are obtained in terms of
design parameters which are exploited to tune the closed loop system
performance. The results not only show that DSC technique recover the
performance of a backstepping controller for a small range of filter parameter
but also derive the maximum bound for it. Furthermore the stability bounds are
also derived in the presence of disturbances and convergence of trajectories to
a small penultimate bound is proved. The convergence results are shown to hold
for less conservative choice of filter parameter and observer gain. The
effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through simulation
example."
"While the disciplines of physics and engineering sciences in many cases have
taken advantage from accurate time-series prediction of system behaviour by
applying ordinary differential equation systems upon precise basic physical
laws such approach hardly could be adopted by other scientific disciplines
where precise mathematical basic laws are unknown. A new modelling schema, the
NMPC-graph, opens the possibility of interdisciplinary and generic nonlinear,
multivariate, dynamic, and recursive causal modelling in domains where basic
laws are only known as qualitative relationships among parameters while their
precise mathematical nature remains undisclosed at modelling time. The
symbolism of NMPC-graph is kept simple and suited for analysts without advanced
mathematical skills. This article presents the definition of the NMPC-graph
modelling method and its six component types. Further, it shows how to solve
the inverse problem of deriving a nonlinear ordinary differential equation
system from any NMPC-graph in conjunction with historic calibration data by
means of machine learning. This article further discusses how such a derived
NMPC-model can be used for hypothesis testing and time-series prediction with
the expectation of gaining prediction accuracy in comparison to conventional
prediction methods."
"Control synthesis from temporal logic specifications has gained popularity in
recent years. In this paper, we use a model predictive approach to control
discrete time linear systems with additive bounded disturbances subject to
constraints given as formulas of signal temporal logic (STL). We introduce a
(conservative) computationally efficient framework to synthesize control
strategies based on mixed integer programs. The designed controllers satisfy
the temporal logic requirements, are robust to all possible realizations of the
disturbances, and optimal with respect to a cost function. In case the temporal
logic constraint is infeasible, the controller satisfies a relaxed, minimally
violating constraint. An illustrative case study is included."
"Designing and implementing systems as an interconnection of smaller
subsystems is a common practice for modularity and standardization of
components and design algorithms. Although not typically cast in this
framework, many of these approaches can be viewed within the mathematical
context of functional composition. This paper re-interprets and generalizes
within the functional composition framework one such approach known as filter
sharpening, i.e. interconnecting filter modules which have significant
approximation error in order to obtain improved filter characteristics. More
specifically, filter sharpening is approached by determining the composing
polynomial to minimize the infinity-norm of the approximation error, utilizing
the First Algorithm of Remez. This is applied both to sharpening for FIR,
even-symmetric filters and for the more general case of subfilters that have
complex-valued frequency responses including causal IIR filters and for
continuous-time filters. Within the framework of functional composition, this
paper also explores the use of functional decomposition to approximate a
desired system as a composition of simpler functions based on a two-norm on the
approximation error. Among the potential advantages of this decomposition is
the ability for modular implementation in which the inner component of the
functional decomposition represents the subfilters and the outer the
interconnection."
"This paper examines the verification of stability, a control requirement,
over discrete control systems represented as Simulink diagrams, using different
model checking approaches and tools. Model checking comprises the (exhaustive)
exploration of a model of a system, to determine if a requirement is satisfied.
If that is not the case, examples of the requirement's violation within the
system's model are provided, as witnesses. These examples are potentially
complementary to previous work on automatic theorem proving, when a system is
not proven to be stable, but no proof of instability can be provided.
  We experimentally evaluated the suitability of four model checking approaches
to verify stability on a set of benchmarks including linear and nonlinear,
controlled and uncontrolled, discrete systems, via Lyapunov's second method or
Lyapunov's direct method. Our study included symbolic, bounded, statistical and
hybrid model checking, through the open-source tools NuSMV, UCLID, S-TaLiRo and
SpaceEx, respectively. Our experiments and results provide an insight on the
strengths and limitations of these model checking approaches for the
verification of control requirements for discrete systems at Simulink level. We
found that statistical model checking with S-TaLiRo is the most suitable option
to complement our previous work on automatic theorem proving."
"This paper presents tracking control laws for two different objectives of a
nonholonomic system - a spherical robot - using a geometric approach. The first
control law addresses orientation tracking using a modified trace potential
function. The second law addresses contact position tracking using a $right$
transport map for the angular velocity error. A special case of this is
position and reduced orientation stabilization. Both control laws are
coordinate free. The performance of the feedback control laws are demonstrated
through simulations."
"In this article, we propose a control law for almost-global asymptotic
tracking (AGAT) of a smooth reference trajectory for a fully actuated simple
mechanical system (SMS) evolving on a Riemannian manifold which can be embedded
in a Euclidean space. The existing results on tracking for an SMS are either
local, or almost-global, only in the case the manifold is a Lie group. In the
latter case, the notion of a configuration error is naturally defined by the
group operation and facilitates a global analysis. However, such a notion is
not intrinsic to a Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we define a
configuration error followed by error dynamics on a Riemannian manifold, and
then prove AGAT. The results are demonstrated for a spherical pendulum which is
an SMS on $S^2$ and for a particle moving on a Lissajous curve in
$\mathbb{R}^3$."
"This paper presents a geometric framework for analysis of dynamics of
flapping wing micro aerial vehicles (FWMAV) which achieve locomotion in the
special Euclidean group SE(3) using internal shape changes. We review the
special structure of the configuration manifold of such systems. This work
addresses to extend the work in geometric locomotion to the aerial locomotion
problem. Furthermore, there seems to be limited work in modelling of flapping
wing bodies in a geometric framework. We derive the dynamic model of the FWMAV
using Lagrangian reduction theory defined on symmetry groups. The reduction is
achieved by applying Hamilton's variation principle on a reduced Lagrangian.
The resultant dynamics is governed by the Euler-Poincare and Euler-Lagrange
equations."
"Vehicle platooning facilitates the partial automation of vehicles and can
significantly reduce fuel consumption. Mobile communication infrastructure
makes it possible to dynamically coordinate the formation of platoons en route.
We consider a centralized system that provides trucks with routes and speed
profiles allowing them to dynamically form platoons during their journeys. For
this to work, all possible pairs of vehicles that can platoon based on their
location, destination, and other constraints have to be identified. The
presented approach scales well to large vehicle fleets and realistic road
networks by extracting features from the transport assignments of the vehicles
and rules out a majority of possible pairs based on these features only. Merely
a small number of remaining pairs are considered in depth by a complete and
computationally expensive algorithm. This algorithm conclusively decides if
platooning is possible for a pair based on the complete data associated with
the two vehicles. We derive appropriate features for the problem and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a simulation example."
"This paper studies output feedback consensus protocol design problems for
linear multi-agent systems with directed graphs. We consider both leaderless
and leader-follower consensus with a leader whose control input is nonzero and
bounded. We propose a novel sequential observer design approach, which makes it
possible to design fully distributed adaptive output feedback protocols that
the existing methods fail to accomplish. With the sequential observer
architecture, we show that leaderless consensus can be achieved for any
strongly connected directed graph in a fully distributed manner, whenever the
agents are stabilizable and detectable. For the case with a leader of bounded
control input, we further present novel distributed adaptive output feedback
protocols, which include nonlinear functions to deal with the effect of the
leaders's nonzero control input and are able to achieve leader-follower
consensus for any directed graph containing a directed spanning tree with the
leader as the root."
"This paper addresses the distributed consensus protocol design problem for
linear multi-agent systems with directed graphs and external unmatched
disturbances. A novel distributed adaptive consensus protocol is proposed to
achieve leader-follower consensus for any directed graph containing a directed
spanning tree with the leader as the root node. It is noted that the adaptive
protocol might suffer from a problem of undesirable parameter drift phenomenon
when bounded external disturbances exist. To deal with this issue, a
distributed robust adaptive consensus protocol is designed to guarantee the
ultimate boundedness of both the consensus error and the adaptive coupling
weights in the presence of external disturbances. Both adaptive protocols are
fully distributed, relying on only the agent dynamics and the relative states
of neighboring agents."
"Large scale monitoring systems enable efficient field level data collection
at high temporal and spatial resolutions. One example is the deployment of such
systems in pipeline infrastructure applications which have to be monitored for
leaks and protected from unauthorized access, with the potential of causing
significant environmental and economic damage. The paper discusses a
multi-level system architecture for data collection and processing based on the
collaborative integration of wireless sensor networks and unmanned aerial
vehicles. Three sensor fusion methods: Kalman filtering, Fuzzy Sensor
Validation and Fusion (FUSVAF) and Consensus-based processing, are considered
for intelligent data reduction and situational awareness while alleviating
communication bottlenecks across the multi-level network. Simulation and
experimental results are presented."
"In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for the joint optimization
of investment and operation of a microgrid, taking the impact of energy
storage, renewable energy integration, and demand response into consideration.
We first study the renewable energy generations in Hong kong, and identify the
potential benefit of mixed deployment of solar and wind energy generations.
Then we model the joint investment and operation as a two-period stochastic
programming program. In period-1, the microgrid operator makes the optimal
investment decisions on the capacities of solar power generation, wind power
generation, and energy storage. In period-2, the operator coordinates the power
supply and demand in the microgrid to minimize the operating cost. We design a
decentralized algorithm for computing the optimal pricing and power consumption
in period-2, based on which we solve the optimal investment problem in
period-1. We also study the impact of prediction error of renewable energy
generation on the portfolio investment using robust optimization framework.
Using realistic meteorological data obtained from the Hong Kong observatory, we
numerically characterize the optimal portfolio investment decisions, optimal
day-ahead pricing and power scheduling, and demonstrate the advantage of using
mixed renewable energy and demand response in terms of reducing investment
cost."
"We consider the problem of generating randomized control sequences for
complex networked systems typically actuated by human agents. Our approach
leverages a concept known as control improvisation, which is based on a
combination of data-driven learning and controller synthesis from formal
specifications. We learn from existing data a generative model (for instance,
an explicit-duration hidden Markov model, or EDHMM) and then supervise this
model in order to guarantee that the generated sequences satisfy some desirable
specifications given in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). We present
an implementation of our approach and apply it to the problem of mimicking the
use of lighting appliances in a residential unit, with potential applications
to home security and resource management. We present experimental results
showing that our approach produces realistic control sequences, similar to
recorded data based on human actuation, while satisfying suitable formal
requirements."
"A double inverted pendulum plant has been in the domain of control
researchers as an established model for studies on stability. The stability of
such as a system taking the linearized plant dynamics has yielded satisfactory
results by many researchers using classical control techniques. The established
model that is analyzed as part of this work was tested under the influence of
time delay, where the controller was fine tuned using a BAT algorithm taking
into considering the fitness function of square of error. This proposed method
gave results which were better when compared without time delay wherein the
calculated values indicated the issues when incorporating time delay."
"Energy storage is a fundamental component for the development of sustainable
and environment-aware technologies. One of the critical challenges that needs
to be overcome is preserving the State of Health (SoH) in energy harvesting
systems, where bursty arrival of energy and load may severely degrade the
battery. Tools from Markov process and Dynamic Programming theory are becoming
an increasingly popular choice to control dynamics of these systems due to
their ability to seamlessly incorporate heterogeneous components and support a
wide range of applications. Mapping aging rate measures to fit within the
boundaries of these tools is non-trivial. In this paper, a framework for
modeling and controlling the aging rate of batteries based on Markov process
theory is presented. Numerical results illustrate the tradeoff between battery
degradation and task completion delay enabled by the proposed framework."
"Power systems normally operate at their stable operating conditions where the
power supply and demand are balanced. In emergency situations, the operators
proceed to cut a suitable amount of loads to rebalance the supply-demand and
hopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control scheme
results in interrupted service with severely economic damages to customers. In
order to provide seamless electricity service to customers, this paper proposes
a viable alternative for traditional remedial controls of power grids by
exploiting the plentiful transmission facilities. In particular, we consider
two emergency control schemes involving adjustment of the susceptance of a
number of selected transmission lines to drive either fault-on dynamics or
post-fault dynamics, and thereby stabilize the system under emergency
situations. The corresponding emergency control problems will be formulated and
partly solved in some specific cases. Simple numerical simulation will be used
to illustrate the concept of this paper."
"This paper discusses the problem of designing a self-balancing unicycle where
pedals are used for both power generation and speed control. After developing
the principal physical aspects (in the longitudinal dimension), we describe an
abstract model in the form of a collection of hybrid automata, together with
design requirements to be met by an ideal controller. We discuss
simplifications and assumptions that make this model amenable to verification
and validation tools such as SpaceEx. To enable experimentation with different
prototypical controllers and user behaviours in concrete scenarios, we also
develop a simple simulation framework using digital time."
"We present a new online approach to track human whole-body motion from motion
capture data, i.e., positions of labeled markers attached to the human body.
Tracking in noisy data can be effectively performed with the aid of
well-established recursive state estimation techniques. This allows us to
systematically take noise of the marker measurements into account. However, as
joint limits imposed by the human body have to be satisfied during estimation,
first we transform this constrained estimation problem into an unconstrained
one by using periodic functions. Then, we apply the Smart Sampling Kalman
Filter to solve this unconstrained estimation problem. The proposed recursive
state estimation approach makes the human motion tracking very robust to
partial occlusion of markers and avoids any special treatment or reconstruction
of the missed markers. A concrete implementation built on the kinematic human
reference model of the Master Motor Map framework and a Vicon motion capture
system is evaluated. Different captured motions show that our implementation
can accurately estimate whole-body human motion in real-time and outperforms
existing gradient-based approaches. In addition, we demonstrate its ability to
smoothly handle incomplete marker data."
"Consider the question of building a system of commands remotely controlled
robot that can perform motion stabilization in the presence of a constant delay
of the control signal."
"This paper considers a remote state estimation problem with multiple sensors
observing a dynamical process, where sensors transmit local state estimates
over an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) packet dropping
channel to a remote estimator. At every discrete time instant, the remote
estimator decides whether each sensor should transmit or not, with each sensor
transmission incurring a fixed energy cost. The channel is shared such that
collisions will occur if more than one sensor transmits at a time. Performance
is quantified via an optimization problem that minimizes a convex combination
of the expected estimation error covariance at the remote estimator and
expected energy usage across the sensors. For transmission schedules dependent
only on the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator, this work
establishes structural results on the optimal scheduling which show that 1) for
unstable systems, if the error covariance is large then a sensor will always be
scheduled to transmit, and 2) there is a threshold-type behaviour in switching
from one sensor transmitting to another. Specializing to the single sensor
case, these structural results demonstrate that a threshold policy (i.e.
transmit if the error covariance exceeds a certain threshold and don't transmit
otherwise) is optimal. We also consider the situation where sensors transmit
measurements instead of state estimates, and establish structural results
including the optimality of threshold policies for the single sensor, scalar
case. These results provide a theoretical justification for the use of such
threshold policies in variance based event triggered estimation. Numerical
studies confirm the qualitative behaviour predicted by our structural results.
An extension of the structural results to Markovian packet drops is also
outlined."
"In vehicle traffic networks, congestion on one outgoing link of a diverging
junction often impedes flow to other outgoing links, a phenomenon known as the
first-in-first-out (FIFO) property. Simplified traffic models that do not
account for the FIFO property result in monotone dynamics for which powerful
analysis techniques exist. FIFO models are in general not monotone, but have
been shown to be mixed monotone - a generalization of monotonicity that enables
similarly powerful analysis techniques. In this paper, we study traffic flow
models for which the FIFO property is only partial, that is, flows at diverging
junctions exhibit a combination of FIFO and non-FIFO phenomena. We show that
mixed monotonicity extends to this wider class of models and establish
conditions that guarantee convergence to an equilibrium."
"An event-based state estimation approach for reducing communication in a
networked control system is proposed. Multiple distributed
sensor-actuator-agents observe a dynamic process and sporadically exchange
their measurements and inputs over a bus network. Based on these data, each
agent estimates the full state of the dynamic system, which may exhibit
arbitrary inter-agent couplings. Local event-based protocols ensure that data
is transmitted only when necessary to meet a desired estimation accuracy. This
event-based scheme is shown to mimic a centralized Luenberger observer design
up to guaranteed bounds, and stability is proven in the sense of bounded
estimation errors for bounded disturbances. The stability result extends to the
distributed control system that results when the local state estimates are used
for distributed feedback control. Simulation results highlight the benefit of
the event-based approach over classical periodic ones in reducing communication
requirements."
"Motivated by the Model-Based Design process for Cyber-Physical Systems, we
consider issues in conformance testing of systems. Conformance is a
quantitative notion of similarity between the output trajectories of systems,
which considers both temporal and spatial aspects of the outputs. Previous work
developed algorithms for computing the conformance degree between two systems,
and demonstrated how formal verification results for one system can be re-used
for a system that is conformant to it. In this paper, we study the relation
between conformance and a generalized approximate simulation relation for the
class of Open Metric Transition Systems (OMTS). This allows us to prove a
small-gain theorem for OMTS, which gives sufficient conditions under which the
feedback interconnection of systems respects the conformance relation, thus
allowing the building of more complex systems from conformant components."
"Here, we study the ultimately bounded stability of network of mismatched
systems using Lyapunov direct method. The upper bound on the error of
oscillators from the center of the neighborhood is derived. Then the
performance of an adaptive compensation via decentralized control is analyzed.
Finally, the analytical results for a network of globally connected Lorenz
oscillators are verified."
"In recent years, as fractional calculus becomes more and more broadly used in
research across different academic disciplines, there are increasing demands
for the numerical tools for the computation of fractional
integration/differentiation, and the simulation of fractional order systems.
Time to time, being asked about which tool is suitable for a specific
application, the authors decide to carry out this survey to present
recapitulative information of the available tools in the literature, in hope of
benefiting researchers with different academic backgrounds. With this
motivation, the present article collects the scattered tools into a dashboard
view, briefly introduces their usage and algorithms, evaluates the accuracy,
compares the performance, and provides informative comments for selection."
"Tag population estimation has recently attracted significant research
attention due to its paramount importance on a variety of radio frequency
identification (RFID) applications. However, most, if not all, of existing
estimation mechanisms are proposed for the static case where tag population
remains constant during the estimation process, thus leaving the more
challenging dynamic case unaddressed, despite the fundamental importance of the
latter case on both theoretical analysis and practical application. In order to
bridge this gap, %based on \textit{dynamic framed-slotted ALOHA} (DFSA)
protocol, we devote this paper to designing a generic framework of stable and
accurate tag population estimation schemes based on Kalman filter for both
static and dynamic RFID systems. %The objective is to devise estimation schemes
and analyze the boundedness of estimation error. Technically, we first model
the dynamics of RFID systems as discrete stochastic processes and leverage the
techniques in extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cumulative sum control chart
(CUSUM) to estimate tag population for both static and dynamic systems. By
employing Lyapunov drift analysis, we mathematically characterise the
performance of the proposed framework in terms of estimation accuracy and
convergence speed by deriving the closed-form conditions on the design
parameters under which our scheme can stabilise around the real population size
with bounded relative estimation error that tends to zero with exponential
convergence rate."
"We consider joint energy storage management and load scheduling at a
residential site with integrated renewable generation. Assuming unknown
arbitrary dynamics of renewable source, loads, and electricity price, we aim at
optimizing the load scheduling and energy storage control simultaneously in
order to minimize the overall system cost within a finite time period. Besides
incorporating battery operational constraints and costs, we model each
individual load task by its requested power intensity and service durations, as
well as the maximum and average delay requirements. To tackle this finite time
horizon stochastic problem, we propose a real-time scheduling and storage
control solution by applying a sequence of modification and transformation to
employ Lyapunov optimization that otherwise is not directly applicable. With
our proposed algorithm, we show that the joint load scheduling and energy
storage control can in fact be separated and sequentially determined.
Furthermore, both scheduling and energy control decisions have closed-form
solutions for simple implementation. Through analysis, we show that our
proposed real-time algorithm has a bounded performance guarantee from the
optimal T-slot look-ahead solution and is asymptotically equivalent to it as
the battery capacity and time period goes to infinity. The effectiveness of
joint load scheduling and energy storage control by our proposed algorithm is
demonstrated through simulation as compared with alternative algorithms."
"Here, we study a networked control system with similar linear time-invariant
plants. Using master stability function method we propose a network
optimization method to minimize the feedback network order in the sense
Frobenius norm. Then we verify our results with numerical example. We show that
this method outperforms the known feedback network optimization methods namely
matching condition."
"Partial diffusion scheme is an effective method for reducing computational
load and power consumption in adaptive network implementation. The Information
is exchanged among the nodes, usually over noisy links. In this paper, we
consider a general version of partial-diffusion least-mean-square (PDLMS)
algorithm in the presence of various sources of imperfect information
exchanges. Like the established PDLMS, we consider two different schemes to
select the entries, sequential and stochastic, for transmission at each
iteration. Our objective is to analyze the aggregate effect of these
perturbations on general PDLMS strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that
considering noisy link assumption adds a new complexity to the related
optimization problem and the trade-off between communication cost and
estimation performance in comparison to ideal case becomes unbalanced."
"For mechanical systems we present a controller able to track an unknown
smooth signal, converging in finite time and by means of a continuous control
signal. The control scheme is insensitive against unknown perturbations with
bounded derivative. The controller consists of a non locally Lipschitz state
feedback control law, and a discontinuous integral controller, that is able to
estimate the unknown perturbation and to compensate for it. To complete an
output feedback control a continuous observer for the velocity is added. It is
shown that the closed loop consisting of state feedback, state observer and
discontinuous integral controller has an equilibrium point that is globally,
finite time stable, despite of perturbations with bounded derivative. The proof
is based on a new smooth Lyapunov function."
"The problem of faulty sensor detection is investigated in large sensor
networks where the sensor faults are sparse and time-varying, such as those
caused by attacks launched by an adversary. Group testing and the Kalman filter
are designed jointly to perform real time system state estimation and
time-varying faulty sensor detection with a small number of tests. Numerical
results show that the faulty sensors are efficiently detected and removed, and
the system state estimation performance is significantly improved via the
proposed method. Compared with an approach that tests sensors one by one, the
proposed approach reduces the number of tests significantly while maintaining a
similar fault detection performance."
"The large-scale integration of renewable generation directly affects the
reliability of power grids. We investigate the problem of power balancing in a
general renewable-integrated power grid with storage and flexible loads. We
consider a power grid that is supplied by one conventional generator (CG) and
multiple renewable generators (RGs) each co-located with storage,and is
connected with external markets. An aggregator operates the power grid to
maintain power balance between supply and demand. Aiming at minimizing the
long-term system cost, we first propose a real-time centralized power balancing
solution, taking into account the uncertainty of the renewable generation,
loads, and energy prices. We then provide a distributed implementation
algorithm, significantly reducing both computational burden and communication
overhead. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal
as the storage capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint loosens.
Moreover, the distributed implementation enjoys a fast convergence rate, and
enables each RG and the aggregator to make their own decisions. Simulation
shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives and can achieve
near-optimal performance for a wide range of storage capacity."
"Recent development of contraction theory based analysis of singularly
perturbed system has opened the door for inspecting differential behavior of
multi time-scale systems. In this paper a contraction theory based framework is
proposed for stabilization of singularly perturbed systems. The primary
objective is to design a feedback controller to achieve bounded tracking error
for both standard and non-standard singularly perturbed systems. This framework
provides relaxation over traditional quadratic Lyapunov based method as there
is no need to satisfy interconnection conditions during controller design
algorithm. Moreover, the stability bound does not depend on smallness of
singularly perturbed parameter. Combined with high gain scaling, the proposed
technique is shown to assure contraction of approximate feedback linearizable
systems. These findings extend the class of nonlinear systems which can be made
contracting."
"This paper proposes a novel algorithm to optimally size and place storage in
low voltage (LV) networks based on a linearized multiperiod optimal power flow
method which we call forward backward sweep optimal power flow (FBS-OPF). We
show that this method has good convergence properties, its solution deviates
slightly from the optimum and makes the storage sizing and placement problem
tractable for longer investment horizons. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
method by assessing the economic viability of distributed and centralized
storage in LV grids with a high photovoltaic penetration (PV). As a main
result, we quantify that for the CIGRE LV test grid distributed storage
configurations are preferable, since they allow for less PV curtailment due to
grid constraints."
"The paper considers a distributed robust estimation problem over a network
with Markovian randomly varying topology. The objective is to deal with network
variations locally, by switching observer gains at affected nodes only. We
propose sufficient conditions which guarantee a suboptimal $H_\infty$ level of
relative disagreement of estimates in such observer networks. When the status
of the network is known globally, these sufficient conditions enable the
network gains to be computed by solving certain LMIs. When the nodes are to
rely on a locally available information about the network topology, additional
rank constraints are used to condition the gains, given this information. The
results are complemented by necessary conditions which relate properties of the
interconnection graph Laplacian to the mean-square detectability of the plant
through measurement and interconnection channels."
"In this paper, we present a distributed estimation setup where local agents
estimate their states from relative measurements received from their
neighbours. In the case of heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where only
relative measurements are available, this is of high relevance. The objective
is to improve the scalability of the existing distributed estimation algorithms
by restricting the agents to estimating only their local states and those of
immediate neighbours. The presented estimation algorithm also guarantees robust
performance against model and measurement disturbances. It is shown that it can
be integrated into output synchronization algorithms."
"In this paper, we study a tracking control problem for linear time-invariant
systems, with model parametric uncertainties, under input and states
constraints. We apply the idea of modular design introduced in Benosman et al.
2014, to solve this problem in the model predictive control (MPC) framework. We
propose to design an MPC with input-to-state stability (ISS) guarantee, and
complement it with an extremum seeking (ES) algorithm to iteratively learn the
model uncertainties. The obtained MPC algorithms can be classified as iterative
learning control (ILC)-MPC."
"In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of hybrid multi-agent
system. First, the hybrid multi-agent system is proposed which is composed of
continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic agents. Then, three kinds of
consensus protocols are presented for hybrid multi-agent system. The analysis
tool developed in this paper is based on the matrix theory and graph theory.
With different restrictions of the sampling period, some necessary and
sufficient conditions are established for solving the consensus of hybrid
multi-agent system. The consensus states are also obtained under different
protocols. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretical results."
"Concurrent learning is a recently developed adaptive update scheme that can
be used to guarantee parameter convergence without requiring persistent
excitation. However, this technique requires knowledge of state derivatives,
which are usually not directly sensed and therefore must be estimated. A novel
integral concurrent learning method is developed in this paper that removes the
need to estimate state derivatives while maintaining parameter convergence
properties. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates improved robustness to noise
compared to the traditional derivative formulation."
"Distributed gossip algorithm has been studied in literature for practical
implementation of the distributed consensus algorithm as a fundamental
algorithm for the purpose of in-network collaborative processing. This paper
focuses on optimizing the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm for both
classical and quantum networks. A novel model of the gossip algorithm with
non-uniform clock distribution is proposed which can reach the optimal
convergence rate of the continuous-time consensus algorithm. It is described
that how the non-uniform clock distribution is achievable by modifying the rate
of the Poisson process modeling the clock of the gossip algorithm. The
minimization problem for optimizing the asymptotic convergence rate of the
proposed gossip algorithm and its corresponding semidefinite programming
formulation is addressed analytically. It is shown that the optimal results
obtained for uniform clock distribution are suboptimal compared to those of the
non-uniform one and for non-uniform distribution the optimal answer is not
unique i.e. there is more than one set of probabilities that can achieve the
optimal convergence rate. Based on the optimal continuous-time consensus
algorithm and the detailed balance property, an effective method of obtaining
one of these optimal answers is proposed. Regarding quantum gossip algorithm,
by expanding the density matrix in terms of the generalized Gell-Mann matrices,
the evolution equation of the quantum gossip algorithm is transformed to the
state update equation of the classical gossip algorithm. By defining the
quantum gossip operator, the original optimization problem is formulated as a
convex optimization problem, which can be addressed by semidefinite
programming."
"Cyber-physical systems are found in many applications such as power networks,
manufacturing processes, and air and ground transportation systems. Maintaining
security of these systems under cyber attacks is an important and challenging
task, since these attacks can be erratic and thus difficult to model. Secure
estimation problems study how to estimate the true system states when
measurements are corrupted and/or control inputs are compromised by attackers.
The authors in [1] proposed a secure estimation method when the set of attacked
nodes (sensors, controllers) is fixed. In this paper, we extend these results
to scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time. We
formulate this secure estimation problem into the classical error correction
problem [2] and we show that accurate decoding can be guaranteed under a
certain condition. Furthermore, we propose a combined secure estimation method
with our proposed secure estimator and the Kalman Filter for improved practical
performance. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our method through
simulations of two scenarios where an unmanned aerial vehicle is under
adversarial attack."
"In this paper, we present the convergence analysis of proportionate-type
least mean square (Pt-LMS) algorithm that identifies the sparse system
effectively and more suitable for real time VLSI applications. Both first and
second order convergence analysis of Pt-LMS algorithm is studied. Optimum
convergence behavior of Pt-LMS algorithm is studied from the second order
convergence analysis provided in this paper. Simulation results were conducted
to verify the analytical results."
"Cyber data attacks are the worst-case interacting bad data to power system
state estimation and cannot be detected by existing bad data detectors. In this
paper, we for the first time analyze the likelihood of cyber data attacks by
characterizing the actions of a malicious intruder. We propose to use Markov
decision process to model an intruder's strategy, where the objective is to
maximize the cumulative reward across time. Linear programming method is
employed to find the optimal attack policy from the intruder's perspective.
Numerical experiments are conducted to study the intruder's attack strategy in
test power systems."
"In order to improve the performances of recently-presented improved
normalized subband adaptive filter (INSAF) and proportionate INSAF algorithms
for highly noisy system, this paper proposes their set-membership versions by
exploiting the theory of set-membership filtering. Apart from obtaining smaller
steady-state error, the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the overall
computational complexity. In addition, to further improve the steady-state
performance for the algorithms, their smooth variants are developed by using
the smoothed absolute subband output errors to update the step sizes.
Simulation results in the context of acoustic echo cancellation have
demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms."
"In this paper, we have proposed the optimization approach of design parameter
of generalized cloud control system by hybrid chaos optimization approach. The
approach determined the off-line parameters of the cloud control system by the
chaos approach and on-line by gradient approach."
"This document presents an introduction of two commonly used power system
differential algebraic equations (DAEs) for studying power system dynamics like
electromechanical oscillation and angle stability: the second-order classical
model and the fourth-order detailed generator model. An example is provided on
the IEEE 9-bus system."
"This paper considers transfer functions in consensus systems where agents
have identical SISO dynamics of arbitrary order. The interconnecting structure
is a directed graph. The transfer functions for various inputs and outputs are
presented in simple product forms with a similar structure of the numerator and
the denominator. This structure combines the network properties and the agent
model in an explicit way. The link between a higher-order and a
single-integrator dynamics is shown and the polynomials of the transfer
function in the single-integrator system are related to the graph properties.
These properties also allow to generalize a result on the minimal dimension of
the controllable subspace to the directed graphs."
"This paper studies a pursuit-evasion problem involving a single pursuer and a
single evader, where we are interested in developing a pursuit strategy that
doesn't require continuous, or even periodic, information about the position of
the evader. We propose a self-triggered control strategy that allows the
pursuer to sample the evader's position autonomously, while satisfying desired
performance metric of evader capture. The work in this paper builds on the
previously proposed self-triggered pursuit strategy which guarantees capture of
the evader in finite time with a finite number of evader samples. However, this
algorithm relied on the unrealistic assumption that the evader's exact position
was available to the pursuer. Instead, we extend our previous framework to
develop an algorithm which allows for uncertainties in sampling the information
about the evader, and derive tolerable upper-bounds on the error such that the
pursuer can guarantee capture of the evader. In addition, we outline the
advantages of retaining the evader's history in improving the current estimate
of the true location of the evader that can be used to capture the evader with
even less samples. Our approach is in sharp contrast to the existing works in
literature and our results ensure capture without sacrificing any performance
in terms of guaranteed time-to-capture, as compared to classic algorithms that
assume continuous availability of information."
"We study continuous-time consensus dynamics for multi-agent systems with
undirected switching interaction graphs. We establish a necessary and
sufficient condition for exponential asymptotic consensus based on the
classical theory of complete observability. The proof is remarkably simple
compared to similar results in the literature and the conditions for consensus
are mild. This observability-based method can also be applied to the case where
negatively weighted edges are present. Additionally, as a by-product of the
observability based arguments, we show that the nodes' initial value can be
recovered from the signals on the edges up to a shift of the network average."
"This paper explores solutions to linearized powerflow equations with
bus-voltage phasors represented in rectangular coordinates. The key idea is to
solve for complex-valued perturbations around a nominal voltage profile from a
set of linear equations that are obtained by neglecting quadratic terms in the
original nonlinear power-flow equations. We prove that for lossless networks,
the voltage profile where the real part of the perturbation is suppressed
satisfies active-power balance in the original nonlinear system of equations.
This result motivates the development of approximate solutions that improve
over conventional DC power-flow approximations, since the model includes ZIP
loads. For distribution networks that only contain ZIP loads in addition to a
slack bus, we recover a linear relationship between the approximate voltage
profile and the constant-current component of the loads and the nodal active
and reactive-power injections."
"In this study, the feed rate optimization model based on a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) was introduced for spiral drilling process. Firstly, the
experimental data on spiral drilling was taken from literature for different
axial force parameters and with various feed rate decisions made, having the
length of a hole being drilled as a reward. Proposed optimization model was
computed using value iteration method. Secondly, the results of computations
were displayed for optimal decision to be made on each state. Proposed
decisions for an optimal feed rate could be utilized in order to improve the
efficiency of spiral drilling process in terms of cost and time."
"In this contribution, we derive ILEG, an iterative algorithm to find risk
sensitive solutions to nonlinear, stochastic optimal control problems. The
algorithm is based on a linear quadratic approximation of an exponential risk
sensitive nonlinear control problem. ILEG allows to find risk sensitive
policies and thus generalizes previous algorithms to solve nonlinear optimal
control based on iterative linear-quadratic methods. Depending on the setting
of the parameter controlling the risk sensitivity, two different strategies on
how to cope with the risk emerge. For positive-value parameters, the control
policy uses high feedback gains whereas for negative-value parameters, it uses
a robust feedforward control strategy (a robust plan) with low gains. These
results are illustrated with a simple example. This note should be considered
as a preliminary report."
"This paper studies the synchronization of a multi-agent system where the
agents are coupled through heterogeneous controller gains. Synchronization
refers to the situation where all the agents in a group have a common velocity
direction. We generalize existing results and show that by using heterogeneous
controller gains, the final velocity direction at which the system of agents
synchronize can be controlled. The effect of heterogeneous gains on the
reachable set of this final velocity direction is further analyzed. We also
show that for realistic systems, a limited control force to stabilize the
agents to the synchronized condition can be achieved by confining these
heterogeneous controller gains to an upper bound. Simulations are given to
support the theoretical findings."
"In this paper, a novel adaptive tuning method of PID neural network (PIDNN)
controller for nonlinear process is proposed. The method utilizes an improved
gradient descent method to adjust PIDNN parameters where the margin stability
will be employed to get high tracking performance and robustness with regard to
external load disturbance and parameter variation. Simulation results show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other well-known learning
methods."
"A robust desensitized cubature Kalman filtering (DCKF) for nonlinear systems
with uncertain parameter is proposed. Sensitivity matrices are defined as the
integral form, and desensitized cost function is designed by penalizing the
posterior covariance trace by a sensitivity-weighting sum of the posteriori
sensitivities. The DCKF gain is obtained by minimizing the desensitized cost
function to amend the state estimation. Then, the sensitivity propagation of
the state estimate errors is described, and the sensitivity of the root square
matrix is obtained by solving a special equation. The effectiveness of the
proposed DCKF was demonstrated by two numerical simulations with uncertain
parameters."
"This paper studies the solution of joint energy storage (ES) ownership
sharing between multiple shared facility controllers (SFCs) and those dwelling
in a residential community. The main objective is to enable the residential
units (RUs) to decide on the fraction of their ES capacity that they want to
share with the SFCs of the community in order to assist them storing
electricity, e.g., for fulfilling the demand of various shared facilities. To
this end, a modified auction-based mechanism is designed that captures the
interaction between the SFCs and the RUs so as to determine the auction price
and the allocation of ES shared by the RUs that governs the proposed joint ES
ownership. The fraction of the capacity of the storage that each RU decides to
put into the market to share with the SFCs and the auction price are determined
by a noncooperative Stackelberg game formulated between the RUs and the
auctioneer. It is shown that the proposed auction possesses the incentive
compatibility and the individual rationality properties, which are leveraged
via the unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) solution of the game. Numerical
experiments are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."
"Ventricular Fibrillation is a disorganized electrical excitation of the heart
that results in inadequate blood flow to the body. It usually ends in death
within seconds. The most common way to treat the symptoms of fibrillation is to
implant a medical device, known as an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
(ICD), in the patient's body. Model-based verification can supply rigorous
proofs of safety and efficacy. In this paper, we build a hybrid system model of
the human heart+ICD closed loop, and show it to be a STORMED system, a class of
o-minimal hybrid systems that admit finite bisimulations. In general, it may
not be possible to compute the bisimulation. We show that approximate
reachability can yield a finite simulation for STORMED systems, which improves
on the existing verification procedure. In the process, we show that certain
compositions respect the STORMED property. Thus it is possible to model check
important formal properties of ICDs in a closed loop with the heart, such as
delayed therapy, missed therapy, or inappropriately administered therapy. The
results of this paper are theoretical and motivate the creation of concrete
model checking procedures for STORMED systems."
"We consider a network-preserved model of power networks with proper algebraic
constraints resulting from constant power loads. Both for the linear and the
nonlinear differential algebraic model of the network, we derive explicit
reduced models which are fully expressed in terms of ordinary differential
equations. For deriving these reduced models, we introduce the ""projected
incidence"" matrix which yields a novel decomposition of the reduced Laplacian
matrix. With the help of this new matrix, we provide a complementary approach
to Kron reduction which is able to cope with constant power loads and nonlinear
power flow equations."
"This paper discusses nonlinear proportional-integral (PI) current control
with anti-windup of reluctance synchronous machines (RSMs) for which the flux
linkage maps are known. The nonlinear controller design is based on the tuning
rule ""Magnitude Optimum criterion"" [1]. Due to the nonlinear flux linkage, the
current dynamics of RSMs are highly nonlinear and, so, the parameters of the PI
controllers and the disturbance compensation feedforward control must be
adjusted online (e.g., for each sampling instant). The theoretical results are
illustrated and validated by simulation and measurement results."
"This paper presents a sampling-based motion planning algorithm for real-time
and propellant-optimized autonomous spacecraft trajectory generation in
near-circular orbits. Specifically, this paper leverages recent algorithmic
advances in the field of robot motion planning to the problem of
impulsively-actuated, propellant-optimized rendezvous and proximity operations
under the Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill (CWH) dynamics model. The approach calls upon
a modified version of the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to grow a set of
feasible trajectories over a deterministic, low-dispersion set of sample points
covering the free state space. To enforce safety, the tree is only grown over
the subset of actively-safe samples, from which there exists a feasible
one-burn collision avoidance maneuver that can safely circularize the
spacecraft orbit along its coasting arc under a given set of potential thruster
failures. Key features of the proposed algorithm include: (i) theoretical
guarantees in terms of trajectory safety and performance, (ii) amenability to
real-time implementation, and (iii) generality, in the sense that a large class
of constraints can be handled directly. As a result, the proposed algorithm
offers the potential for widespread application, ranging from on-orbit
satellite servicing to orbital debris removal and autonomous inspection
missions."
"In certain types of robust control techniques, it is common having to deal
with control problems where the specifications, described in the time domain,
need to be translated to the frequency domain. This usually happens in
techniques, such as Quantitative Feedback Theory, where the control problem is
developed in the frequency domain. Therefore, not only process plants and
disturbances should be specified in this domain, but also the limits and
restrictions initially imposed in time. The question is important if we
consider that any deviation in the parameters transfer from one domain to
another will decisively influence in the development of the problem and, above
all, in the finally result expressed in temporal terms. The technique presented
allows the translation of the upper frequency limit in generic tracking
specifications from time domain to frequency domain accurately. It will use
approaches based on 2nd order systems or an envelope approach based on higher
order systems."
"The quality of energy produced in renewable energy systems has to be at the
high level specified by respective standards and directives. The estimation
accuracy of grid signal parameters is one of the most important factors
affecting this quality. This paper presents a method for a very fast and
accurate amplitude and phase grid signal estimation using the Fast Fourier
Transform procedure and maximum decay sidelobes windows. The most important
features of the method are the elimination of the impact associated with the
conjugate's component on the results and the straightforward implementation.
Moreover, the measurement time is very short - even far less than one period of
the grid signal. The influence of harmonics on the results is reduced by using
a bandpass prefilter. Even using a 40 dB FIR prefilter for the grid signal with
THD = 38%, SNR = 53 dB and a 20-30% slow decay exponential drift the maximum
error of the amplitude estimation is approximately 1% and approximately 0.085
rad of the phase estimation in a real-time DSP system for 512 samples. The
errors are smaller by several orders of magnitude for more accurate prefilters."
"This paper discusses first order node models for macroscopic multi-commodity
traffic simulation. There are two parts: (1) input-output flow computation
based on input demand, input link priorities, split ratios that define how
incoming flow is distributed between output links, and output supply; and (2) a
traffic assignment algorithm for the case when split ratios are not known a
priori or are only partially known.
  Input link priorities define how output supply is distributed between
incoming flows. We deal with arbitrary input link priorities. Also, in this
node model we specifically address the issue of the First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
rule: in the case of one of the output links being overly congested the FIFO
rule may be too restrictive, blocking the flow to other outputs and causing
unreasonable spillback. We relax the FIFO rule through a parametrization that
describes how output links influence each other and allows tuning the model to
anything between full FIFO and no FIFO.
  Then, we discuss multi-output nodes where the split ratios are not known a
priori and present a driver choice model for assigning unknown split ratios
based on the downstream supply.
  All methods in this paper are presented for multi-commodity traffic flows."
"In this short note we prove a hierarchical stability result that applies to
hybrid dynamical systems satisfying the hybrid basic conditions of (Goebel et
al., 2012). In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for uniform
asymptotic stability of a compact set based on some hierarchical stability
assumptions involving two nested closed sets containing such a compact set.
Moreover, mimicking the well known result for cascaded systems, we prove that
the basin of attraction of such compact set coincides with the largest set from
which all solutions are bounded. The result appears to be useful when applied
to several recent works involving hierarchical control architectures."
"Optimal control models have been successful in describing many aspects of
human movement. The interpretation of such models regarding neuronal
implementation of the human motor system is not clear. An important aspects of
optimal control policies is the notion of cost. Optimal control seeks to
minimize a notion of cost, while meeting certain goals. We offer a method to
transform current methods in the literature from their traditional form by
changing the norm by which cost is assessed. We show how sparsity can be
introduced into current optimal approaches that use continuous control signals.
We assess cost using the infinity norm. This results in optimal signals which
can be represented by a small amount of Dirac delta functions. Sparsity has
played an important role in theoretical neuroscience for information processing
(such as vision). In this work, to obtain sparse control signals, the infinity
norm is used as a penalty on the control signal, which is then encoded with
Dirac delta functions. We show, for a basic physical system, a point mass can
be moved between two points in a way that resembles human fast reaching
movements. Despite the sparse nature of the control signal, the movements that
result are continuous and smooth. These control signals are simpler than their
non-sparse counterparts, yet yield comparable results when applied towards
modeling reaching movements. In addition, such sparse control signals resemble
a sequence of spikes, giving this approach a biological interpretation. Actual
neuronal implementations are more complex. However, this work shows, in
principle, that sparsely encoded control signals are a plausible implementation
for the control of reaching movements. Leading techniques for modeling human
movements can easily be adjusted in order to introduce sparsity, with a
biological interpretation and the simplified information content of the control
signal."
"Modeling human operator's dynamic plays a very important role in the manual
closed-loop control system, and it is an active research area for several
decades. Based on the characteristics of human brain and behaviour, a new kind
of fractional order mathematical model for human operator in SISO systems is
proposed. Compared with the traditional models based on the commonly used
quasi-linear transfer function method or the optimal control theory method, the
proposed fractional order model has simple structure with only few parameters,
and each parameter has explicit physical meanings. The actual data and
experiment results with the second-order controlled element illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method."
"The concept of integration is generally applicable to automatic control of
processes. As shown in this paper, integral controller performs efficient
searches in the extensive prime sets, too. An inspiration by the simple
analytic rules for PID controller tuning results in integral controller that
ensures predictable work regardless of the cardinality of primes. It gives an
innovative application of the feedback control which relates to a gradient
method."
"This article proposes a new Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operation paradigm
to enable a large number of relatively low-cost UAVs to fly
beyond-line-of-sight without costly sensing and communication systems or
substantial human intervention in individual UAV control. Under current
free-flight-like paradigm, wherein a UAV can travel along any route as long as
it avoids restricted airspace and altitudes. However, this requires expensive
on-board sensing and communication as well as substantial human effort in order
to ensure avoidance of obstacles and collisions. The increased cost serves as
an impediment to the emergence and development of broader UAV applications. The
main contribution of this work is to propose the use of pre-established route
network for UAV traffic management, which allows: (i) pre- mapping of obstacles
along the route network to reduce the onboard sensing requirements and the
associated costs for avoiding such obstacles; and (ii) use of well-developed
routing algorithms to select UAV schedules that avoid conflicts. Available
GPS-based navigation can be used to fly the UAV along the selected route and
time schedule with relatively low added cost, which therefore, reduces the
barrier to entry into new UAV-applications market. Finally, this article
proposes a new decoupling scheme for conflict-free transitions between edges of
the route network at each node of the route network to reduce potential
conflicts between UAVs and ensuing delays. A simulation example is used to
illustrate the proposed uNet approach."
"This paper presents an approach to systematically design sliding mode control
and manifold to stabilize nonlinear uncertain systems. The objective is also
accomplished to enlarge the inner bound of region of attraction for closed-loop
dynamics. The method is proposed to design a control that guarantees both
asymptotic and finite time stability given helped by (bilinear) sum of squares
programming. The approach introduces an iterative algorithm to search over
sliding mode manifold and Lyapunov function simultaneity. In the case of local
stability it concludes also the subset of estimated region of attraction for
reduced order sliding mode dynamics. The sliding mode manifold and the
corresponding Lyapunov function are obtained if the iterative SOS optimization
program has a solution. Results are demonstrated employing the method for
several examples to show potential of the proposed technique."
"The problem of multi-area interchange scheduling in the presence of
stochastic generation and load is considered. A new interchange scheduling
technique based on a two-stage stochastic minimization of overall expected
operating cost is proposed. Because directly solving the stochastic
optimization is intractable, an equivalent problem that maximizes the expected
social welfare is formulated. The proposed technique leverages the operator's
capability of forecasting locational marginal prices (LMPs) and obtains the
optimal interchange schedule without iterations among operators."
"We consider a decentralized system with multiple controllers and define
substitutability of one controller by another in open-loop strategies. We
explore the implications of this property on the optimization of closed-loop
strategies. In particular, we focus on the decentralized LQG problem with
substitutable actions. Even though the problem we formulate does not belong to
the known classes of ""simpler"" decentralized problems such as partially nested
or quadratically invariant problems, our results show that, under the
substitutability assumption, linear strategies are optimal and we provide a
complete state space characterization of optimal strategies. We also identify a
family of information structures that all give the same optimal cost as the
centralized information structure under the substitutability assumption. Our
results suggest that open-loop substitutability can work as a counterpart of
the information structure requirements that enable simplification of
decentralized control problems."
"This paper considers the collective circular motion of multi-agent systems in
which all the agents are required to traverse different circles or a common
circle at a prescribed angular velocity. It is required to achieve these
collective motions with the heading angles of the agents synchronized or
balanced. In synchronization, the agents and their centroid have a common
velocity direction, while in balancing, the movement of agents causes the
location of the centroid to become stationary. The agents considered are
initially moving at unit speed around individual circles at different angular
velocities. It is assumed that the agents are subjected to limited
communication constraints, and exchange relative information according to a
time-invariant undirected graph. We present suitable feedback control laws for
each of these motion coordination tasks by considering a second-order
rotational dynamics of the agent. Simulations are given to illustrate the
theoretical findings."
"In this paper, we address the problem of finding current waveforms for a
switched reluctance motor that minimize a user-defined combination of torque
ripple and RMS current. The motor model we use is fairly general, and includes
magnetic saturation, voltage and current limits, and highly coupled magnetics
(and therefore, unconventional geometries and winding patterns). We solve this
problem by approximating it as a mixed-integer convex program, which we solve
globally using branch and bound. We demonstrate our approach on an
experimentally verified model of a fully pitched switched reluctance motor, for
which we find the globally optimal waveforms, even for high rotor speeds."
"This paper develops a power management scheme that jointly optimizes the real
power consumption of programmable loads and reactive power outputs of
photovoltaic (PV) inverters in distribution networks. The premise is to
determine the optimal demand response schedule that accounts for the stochastic
availability of solar power, as well as to control the reactive power
generation or consumption of PV inverters adaptively to the real power
injections of all PV units. These uncertain real power injections by PV units
are modeled as random variables taking values from a finite number of possible
scenarios. Through the use of second order cone relaxation of the power flow
equations, a convex stochastic program is formulated. The objectives are to
minimize the negative user utility, cost of power provision, and thermal
losses, while constraining voltages to remain within specified levels. To find
the global optimum point, a decentralized algorithm is developed via the
alternating direction method of multipliers that results in closed-form updates
per node and per scenario, rendering it suitable to implement in distribution
networks with large number of scenarios. Numerical tests and comparisons with
an alternative deterministic approach are provided for typical residential
distribution networks that confirm the efficiency of the algorithm."
"We consider linear time-invariant networks with unknown topology where only a
""manifest"" subset of the nodes can be directly controlled and observed while
the state of the remaining ""latent"" nodes and their number are unknown. Our
goal is to identify the transfer function of the manifest subnetwork and
determine whether interactions between manifest nodes are direct or mediated by
latent nodes. We show that, if there are no inputs to the latent nodes, the
manifest transfer function can be approximated arbitrarily well in the
$H_{\infty}$-norm sense by the transfer function of an auto-regressive model
and present a least-squares estimation method to construct the auto-regressive
model from measured data. We show that the least-squares auto-regressive method
guarantees an arbitrarily small $H_\infty$-norm error in the approximation of
the manifest transfer function, exponentially decaying once the model order
exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, we show that when the latent subnetwork
is acyclic, the proposed method achieves perfect identification of the manifest
transfer function above a specific model order as the length of the data
increases. Various examples illustrate our results."
"In this paper, a robust adaptive type-2 fuzzy higher order sliding mode
controller is designed to stabilize the unstable periodic orbits of uncertain
perturbed chaotic system with internal parameter uncertainties and external
disturbances. In Higher Order Sliding Mode Control (HOSMC),the chattering
phenomena of the control effort is reduced, by using Super Twisting algorithm.
Adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy systems are proposed to approximate the unknown
part of uncertain chaotic system and to generate the Super Twisting signals.
Based on Lyapunov criterion, adaptation laws are derived and the closed loop
system stability is guaranteed. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed controller."
"The future evolution of technological systems dedicated to improve energy
efficiency will strongly depend on effective and reliable Energy Storage
Systems, as key components for Smart Grids, microgrids and electric mobility.
Besides possible improvements in chemical materials and cells design, the
Battery Management System is the most important electronic device that improves
the reliability of a battery pack. In fact, a precise State of Charge (SoC)
estimation allows the energy flows controller to exploit better the full
capacity of each cell. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition for
the SoC, explaining the rationales by a mechanical analogy. We introduce a
novel cell model, conceived as a series of three electric dipoles, together
with a procedure for parameters estimation relying only on voltage measures and
a given current profile. The three dipoles represent the quasi-stationary, the
dynamics and the istantaneous components of voltage measures. An Extended
Kalman Filer (EKF) is adopted as a nonlinear state estimator. Moreover, we
propose a multi-cell EKF system based on a round-robin approach to allow the
same processing block to keep track of many cells at the same time. Performance
tests with a prototype battery pack composed by 18 A123 cells connected in
series show encouraging results."
"The integration of microgrids that depend on the renewable distributed energy
resources with the current power systems is a critical issue in the smart grid.
In this paper, we propose a non-cooperative game-theoretic framework to study
the strategic behavior of distributed microgrids that generate renewable
energies and characterize the power generation solutions by using the Nash
equilibrium concept. Our framework not only incorporates economic factors but
also takes into account the stability and efficiency of the microgrids,
including the power flow constraints and voltage angle regulations. We develop
two decentralized update schemes for microgrids and show their convergence to a
unique Nash equilibrium. Also, we propose a novel fully distributed PMU-enabled
algorithm which only needs the information of voltage angle at the bus. To show
the resiliency of the distributed algorithm, we introduce two failure models of
the smart grid. Case studies based on the IEEE 14-bus system are used to
corroborate the effectiveness and resiliency of the proposed algorithms."
"We consider the problem of controlling switched-mode power converters using
model predictive control. Model predictive control requires solving
optimization problems in real time, limiting its application to systems with
small numbers of switches and a short horizon. We propose a technique for using
off-line computation to approximate the model predictive controller. This is
done by dividing the planning horizon into two segments, and using a quadratic
function to approximate the optimal cost over the second segment. The
approximate model predictive algorithm minimizes the true cost over the first
segment, and the approximate cost over the second segment, allowing the user to
adjust the computational requirements by changing the length of the first
segment. We conclude with two simulated examples."
"Demand response (DR) is becoming increasingly important as the volatility on
the grid continues to increase. Current DR approaches are completely manual and
rule-based or involve deriving first principles based models which are
extremely cost and time prohibitive to build. We consider the problem of
data-driven end-user DR for large buildings which involves predicting the
demand response baseline, evaluating fixed rule based DR strategies and
synthesizing DR control actions. We provide a model based control with
regression trees algorithm (mbCRT), which allows us to perform closed-loop
control for DR strategy synthesis for large commercial buildings. Our
data-driven control synthesis algorithm outperforms rule-based DR by $17\%$ for
a large DoE commercial reference building and leads to a curtailment of $380$kW
and over $\$45,000$ in savings. Our methods have been integrated into an open
source tool called DR-Advisor, which acts as a recommender system for the
building's facilities manager and provides suitable control actions to meet the
desired load curtailment while maintaining operations and maximizing the
economic reward. DR-Advisor achieves $92.8\%$ to $98.9\%$ prediction accuracy
for 8 buildings on Penn's campus. We compare DR-Advisor with other data driven
methods and rank $2^{nd}$ on ASHRAE's benchmarking data-set for energy
prediction."
"Active vibration control has been introduced and used as one of the effective
approaches to suppress unwanted vibrations in different systems. Effective
performance of each vibration control method is contingent to accurate design
and proper dynamics selection of the control unit. These methods have been
extensively studied in various studies in recent years. Each of these new
methods are designed by a specific dynamics for a specific system. Here in this
paper, we aim to introduce some of these recent approaches in a brief
discussion, and familiarize the readers with these techniques. Engineers who
wish to design proper vibration controllers in different scales, from micro- to
macro applications, will certainly design a more successful vibration
controller if they know better about similar techniques, and they can implement
the novelties that other scholars have utilized."
"Typical coordination schemes for future power grids require two-way
communications. Since the number of end power-consuming devices is large, the
bandwidth requirements for such two-way communication schemes may be
prohibitive. Motivated by this observation, we study distributed coordination
schemes that require only one-way limited communications. In particular, we
investigate how dual descent distributed optimization algorithm can be employed
in power networks using one-way communication. In this iterative algorithm,
system coordinators broadcast coordinating (or pricing) signals to the
users/devices who update power consumption based on the received signal. Then
system coordinators update the coordinating signals based on the physical
measurement of the aggregate power usage. We provide conditions to guarantee
the feasibility of the aggregated power usage at each iteration so as to avoid
blackout. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of algorithms under these
conditions, and establish its rate of convergence. We illustrate the
performance of our algorithms using numerical simulations. These results show
that one-way limited communication may be viable for coordinating/operating the
future smart grids."
"As independent service providers shift from conventional energy to renewable
energy sources, the power distribution system will likely experience
increasingly significant fluctuation in supply, given the uncertain and
intermittent nature of renewable sources like wind and solar energy. These
fluctuations in power generation, coupled with time-varying consumer demands of
electricity and the massive scale of power distribution networks present the
need to not only design real-time decentralized power allocation algorithms,
but also characterize how effective they are given fast-changing consumer
demands and power generation capacities. In this paper, we present an Online
Decentralized Dual Descent (OD3) power allocation algorithm and determine (in
the worst case) how much of observed social welfare and price volatility can be
explained by fluctuations in generation capacity and consumer demand.
Convergence properties and performance guarantees of the OD3 algorithm are
analyzed by characterizing the difference between the online decision and the
optimal decision. The theoretical results in the paper are validated and
illustrated by numerical experiments using real data."
"Modern buildings consist of hundreds of sensors and actuators for monitoring
and operation of systems such as HVAC, light and security. To enable portable
applications in next generation smart buildings, we need models and
standardized ontologies that represent these sensors across diverse types of
buildings. Recent research has shown that extracting information such as sensor
type with available metadata and timeseries data analysis is difficult due to
heterogeneity of systems and lack of support for interoperability. We propose
perturbations in the control system as a mechanism to increase the
observability of building systems to extract contextual information and develop
standardized models. We design Quiver, an experimental framework for actuation
of building HVAC system that enables us to perturb the control system safely.
Using Quiver, we demonstrate three applications using empirical experiments on
a real commercial building: colocation of data points, identification of point
type and mapping of dependency between actuators. Our results show that we can
colocate data points in HVAC terminal units with 98.4 % accuracy and 63 %
coverage. We can identify point types of the terminal units with 85.3 %
accuracy. Finally, we map the dependency links between actuators with an
accuracy of 73.5 %, with 8.1 % and 18.4 % false positives and false negatives
respectively."
"In power networks where multiple fuel cell stacks are employed to deliver the
required power, optimal sharing of the power demand between different stacks is
an important problem. This is because the total current collectively produced
by all the stacks is directly proportional to the fuel utilization, through
stoichiometry. As a result, one would like to produce the required power while
minimizing the total current produced. In this paper, an optimization
formulation is proposed for this power distribution control problem. An
algorithm that identifies the globally optimal solution for this problem is
developed. Through an analysis of the KKT conditions, the solution to the
optimization problem is decomposed into on-line and on-line computations. The
on-line computations reduce to simple equation solving. For an application with
a specific v-i function derived from data, we show that analytical solutions
exist for on-line computations. We also discuss the wider applicability of the
proposed approach for similar problems in other domains."
"This paper addresses the problem of optimal control of robotic sensing
systems aimed at autonomous information gathering in scenarios such as
environmental monitoring, search and rescue, and surveillance and
reconnaissance. The information gathering problem is formulated as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with a reward function that captures
uncertainty reduction. Unlike the classical POMDP formulation, the resulting
reward structure is nonlinear in the belief state and the traditional
approaches do not apply directly. Instead of developing a new approximation
algorithm, we show that if attention is restricted to a class of problems with
certain structural properties, one can derive (often tight) upper and lower
bounds on the optimal policy via an efficient myopic computation. These policy
bounds can be applied in conjunction with an online branch-and-bound algorithm
to accelerate the computation of the optimal policy. We obtain informative
lower and upper policy bounds with low computational effort in a target
tracking domain. The performance of branch-and-bounding is demonstrated and
compared with exact value iteration."
"More active participation of the demand side and efficient integration of
distributed energy resources (DERs) such as electric vehicles (trVs), energy
storage (ES), and renewable energy sources (RESs) into the existing power
systems are important design objectives of the future smart grid. In general,
effective demand side management (DSM) would benefit both system operators
(e.g., peak demand reduction) and electricity customers (e.g., cost saving).
For building and home energy scheduling design, heating, ventilation, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systems play a very important role since HVAC power
consumption is very significant and the HVAC load can be scheduled flexibly
while still maintaining user comfort requirements. This thesis focuses on
energy scheduling design for two different application scenarios where HVAC and
various DERs are considered to optimize the benefits electric users."
"The potential of demand side as a frequency reserve proposes interesting
opportunity in handling imbalances due to intermittent renewable energy
sources. This paper proposes a novel approach for computing the parameters of a
stochastic battery model representing the aggregation of Thermostatically
Controlled Loads (TCLs). A hysteresis based non-disruptive control is used
using priority stack algorithm to track the reference regulation signal. The
parameters of admissible ramp-rate and the charge limits of the battery are
dynamically calculated using the information from TCLs that is the status
(on/off), availability and relative temperature distance till the switching
boundary. The approach builds on and improves on the existing research work by
providing a straight-forward mechanism for calculation of stochastic parameters
of equivalent battery model. The effectiveness of proposed approach is
demonstrated by a test case having a large number of residential TCLs tracking
a scaled down real frequency regulation signal."
"We study the stabilization of networked control systems with asynchronous
sensors and controllers. Offsets between the sensor and controller clocks are
unknown and modeled as parametric uncertainty. First we consider multi-input
linear systems and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of linear
time-invariant controllers that are capable of stabilizing the closed-loop
system for every clock offset in a given range of admissible values. For
first-order systems, we next obtain the maximum length of the offset range for
which the system can be stabilized by a single controller. Finally, this bound
is compared with the offset bounds that would be allowed if we restricted our
attention to static output feedback controllers."
"This work is concerned with stochastic consensus conditions of multi-agent
systems with both time-delays and measurement noises. For the case of additive
noises, we develop some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the
stochastic weak consensus by estimating the differential resolvent function for
functional equations. By the martingale convergence theorem, we obtain the
necessary conditions and the sufficient conditions for the stochastic strong
consensus and prove that the small time-delay does not affect the agents to
reach the stochastic strong consensus. For the case of multiplicative noises,
we consider two kinds of time-delays, appeared in the measurement term and the
noise term, respectively. A fundamental theorem is developed to show that the
stochastic weak consensus with an exponential pairwise convergence rate implies
the stochastic strong consensus. By constructing Lyapunov functional, we show
that for any bounded time-delay in the noise term, the stochastic consensus can
be achieved by carefully choosing the control gain according to the time-delay
in the measurement term."
"This note analyzes incoherent feedforward loops in signal processing and
control. It studies the response properties of IFFL's to exponentially growing
inputs, both for a standard version of the IFFL and for a variation in which
the output variable has a positive self-feedback term. It also considers a
negative feedback configuration, using such a device as a controller. It
uncovers a somewhat surprising phenomenon in which stabilization is only
possible in disconnected regions of parameter space, as the controlled system's
growth rate is varied."
"Convergence of controller parameters in standard model reference adaptive
control (MRAC) requires the system states to be persistently exciting (PE), a
restrictive condition to be verified online. A recent data-driven approach,
concurrent learning, uses information-rich past data concurrently with the
standard parameter update laws to guarantee parameter convergence without the
need of the PE condition. This method guarantees exponential convergence of
both the tracking and the controller parameter estimation errors to zero,
whereas, the classical MRAC merely ensures asymptotic convergence of tracking
error to zero. However, the method requires knowledge of the state derivative,
at least at the time instances when the state values are stored in memory. The
method further assumes knowledge of the control allocation matrix. This paper
addresses these limitations by using a memory-based finite-time system
identifier in conjunction with a data-driven approach, leading to convergence
of both the tracking and the controller parameter estimation errors without the
PE condition and knowledge of the system matrices and the state derivative. A
Lyapunov based stability proof is included to justify the validity of the
proposed data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of
the suggested method."
"Contraction-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) formulations are
attractive because of the generally short prediction horizons they require and
the needless use of terminal set computation that are commonly necessary to
guarantee stability. However, the inclusion of the contraction constraint in
the definition of the underlying optimization problem often leads to non
standard features such as the need for multi-step open-loop application of
control sequences or the use of multi-step memorization of the contraction
level that may induce unfeasibility in presence of unexpected disturbance. This
paper proposes a new formulation of contraction-based NMPC in which no
contraction constraint is explicitly involved. Convergence of the resulting
closed-loop behavior is proved under mild assumptions."
"A SHM method is proposed that minimises the required number of sensors for
detecting damage. The damage detection method consists of two steps. In an
initial characterization step, substructuring approach is applied to the
healthy structure in order to isolate the substructures of interest and later,
each substructure is identified by a Vector Auto Regressive with eXogenous
inputs (VARX) model measuring all DOFs. Then, pairwise conditional Granger
causality analysis is carried out with data measured from substructural DOFs to
evaluate the information loss when measurements from all DOFs are not
available. This analysis allows selecting those accelerometers that can be
suppressed minimising the information loss. In the evaluation phase, vibration
data from the reduced set of sensors is compared to the estimated data obtained
from the healthy substructure's VARX model, and as a result a damage indicator
is computed. The proposed detection method is validated by finite element
simulations in a lattice structure model."
"Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular strategy for urban traffic
management that is able to incorporate physical and user defined constraints.
However, the current MPC methods rely on finite horizon predictions that are
unable to guarantee desirable behaviors over long periods of time. In this
paper we design an MPC strategy that is guaranteed to keep the evolution of a
network in a desirable yet arbitrary -safe- set, while optimizing a finite
horizon cost function. Our approach relies on finding a robust controlled
invariant set inside the safe set that provides an appropriate terminal
constraint for the MPC optimization problem. An illustrative example is
included."
"A distributed consensus algorithm for estimating the maximum value of the
initial measurements in a sensor network with communication noise is proposed.
In the absence of communication noise, max estimation can be done by updating
the state value with the largest received measurements in every iteration at
each sensor. In the presence of communication noise, however, the maximum
estimate will incorrectly drift and the estimate at each sensor will diverge.
As a result, a soft-max approximation together with a non-linear consensus
algorithm is introduced herein. A design parameter controls the trade-off
between the soft-max error and convergence speed. An analysis of this trade-off
gives a guideline towards how to choose the design parameter for the max
estimate. We also show that if some prior knowledge of the initial measurements
is available, the consensus process can converge faster by using an optimal
step size in the iterative algorithm. A shifted non-linear bounded transmit
function is also introduced for faster convergence when sensor nodes have some
prior knowledge of the initial measurements. Simulation results corroborating
the theory are also provided."
"We discuss non-ideal torque control in wind turbine systems (WTS). Most
high-level controllers generate a reference torque which is then send to the
underlying electrical drive system (generator+inverter) of the WTS to steer the
turbine/generator to its optimal operation point (depending on the wind speed).
The energy production heavily depends on the mechanical power (i.e. the product
of rotational speed and generator torque). However, since torque sensors in the
MW range are not available or extremely expensive, the torque controllers are
implemented as feedforward controllers and, therefore, are inherently sensitive
to parameter variations/uncertainties. Based on real wind data and a dynamical
WTS model, we discuss causes and impacts of non-ideal (feedforward) torque
control on the energy production and the gross earnings."
"This paper presents an optimal scheduling model for a microgrid participating
in the electricity distribution market in interaction with the Distribution
Market Operator (DMO). The DMO is a concept proposed here, which administers
the established electricity market in the distribution level, i.e., similar to
the role of Independent System Operator (ISO) in the wholesale electricity
market, sets electricity prices, determines the amounts of the power exchange
between market participators, and interacts with the ISO. Considering a
predetermined main grid power transfer to the microgrid, the microgrid
scheduling problem will aim at balancing the power supply and demand while
taking financial objectives into account. A stochastic programming method is
employed to model prevailing uncertainties in the microgrid grid-connected and
islanded operations. Numerical simulations exhibit the application and the
effectiveness of the proposed market-based microgrid scheduling model."
"The increased need for reliable, resilient, and high quality power combined
with a falling cost of distributed generation technologies has resulted in a
rapid growth of microgrid in power systems. Although providing multitude of
benefits, the microgrid power transfer with the main grid, which is commonly
obtained using economy and reliability consideration, may result in major
operational drawbacks, most notably, a large mismatch between actual and
forecasted system loads. This paper investigates the impact of high penetration
microgrids on the power system net load, and further proposes three paradigms
that can be adopted to address the emerging operational issues. The IEEE 6-bus
test system is used for numerical studies and to further support the
discussions."
"Asset management attempts to keep the power system in working conditions. It
requires much coordination between multiple entities and long term planning
often months in advance. In this work we introduce a mid-term asset management
formulation as a stochastic optimization problem, that includes three
hierarchical layers of decision making, namely the mid-term, short-term and
real-time. We devise a tractable scenario approximation technique for
efficiently assessing the complex implications a maintenance schedule inflicts
on a power system. This is done using efficient Monte-Carlo simulations that
trade-off between accuracy and tractability. We then present our implementation
of a distributed scenario-based optimization algorithm for solving our
formulation, and use an updated PJM 5-bus system to show a solution that is
cheaper than other maintenance heuristics that are likely to be considered by
TSOs."
"We propose and experimentally validate a control strategy to dispatch the
operation of a distribution feeder interfacing heterogeneous prosumers by using
a grid-connected battery energy storage system (BESS) as a controllable element
coupled with a minimally invasive monitoring infrastructure. It consists in a
two-stage procedure: day-ahead dispatch planning, where the feeder 5-minute
average power consumption trajectory for the next day of operation (called
\emph{dispatch plan}) is determined, and intra-day/real-time operation, where
the mismatch with respect to the \emph{dispatch plan} is corrected by applying
receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) to decide the BESS
charging/discharging profile while accounting for operational constraints. The
consumption forecast necessary to compute the \emph{dispatch plan} and the
battery model for the MPC algorithm are built by applying adaptive data driven
methodologies. The discussed control framework currently operates on a daily
basis to dispatch the operation of a 20~kV feeder of the EPFL university campus
using a 750~kW/500~kWh lithium titanate BESS."
"Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems are well-understood and methods to
minimize the expected cost are readily available. Less is known about the
statistical properties of the resulting cost function. The contribution of this
paper is a set of analytic expressions for the mean and variance of the LQG
cost function. These expressions are derived using two different methods, one
using solutions to Lyapunov equations and the other using only matrix
exponentials. Both the discounted and the non-discounted cost function are
considered, as well as the finite-time and the infinite-time cost function. The
derived expressions are successfully applied to an example system to reduce the
probability of the cost exceeding a given threshold."
"The quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a great platform for control systems
research as its nonlinear nature and under-actuated configuration make it ideal
to synthesize and analyze control algorithms. After a brief explanation of the
system, several algorithms have been analyzed including their advantages and
disadvantages: PID, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Sliding mode,
Backstepping, Feedback linearization, Adaptive, Robust, Optimal, L1,
H-infinity, Fuzzy logic and Artificial neutral networks. The conclusion of this
work is a proposal of hybrid systems to be considered as they combine
advantages from more than one control philosophy."
"Before a building can participate in a demand response program, its facility
managers must characterize the site's ability to reduce load. Today, this is
often done through manual audit processes and prototypical control strategies.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate a building's demand
response capacity using detailed data from various sensors installed in a
building. We derive a formula for a probabilistic measure that characterizes
various tradeoffs between the available demand response capacity and the
confidence level associated with that curtailment under the constraints of
building occupant comfort level (or utility). Then, we develop a data-driven
framework to associate observed or projected building energy consumption with a
particular set of rules learned from a large sensor dataset. We apply this
methodology using testbeds in two buildings in Singapore: a unique net-zero
energy building and a modern commercial office building. Our experimental
results identify key control parameters and provide insight into the available
demand response strategies at each site."
"Repetitive Scenario Design (RSD) is a randomized approach to robust design
based on iterating two phases: a standard scenario design phase that uses $N$
scenarios (design samples), followed by randomized feasibility phase that uses
$N_o$ test samples on the scenario solution. We give a full and exact
probabilistic characterization of the number of iterations required by the RSD
approach for returning a solution, as a function of $N$, $N_o$, and of the
desired levels of probabilistic robustness in the solution. This novel approach
broadens the applicability of the scenario technology, since the user is now
presented with a clear tradeoff between the number $N$ of design samples and
the ensuing expected number of repetitions required by the RSD algorithm. The
plain (one-shot) scenario design becomes just one of the possibilities, sitting
at one extreme of the tradeoff curve, in which one insists in finding a
solution in a single repetition: this comes at the cost of possibly high $N$.
Other possibilities along the tradeoff curve use lower $N$ values, but possibly
require more than one repetition."
"This overview paper describes the particle methods developed for the
implementation of the a class of Bayes filters formulated using the random
finite set formalism. It is primarily intended for the readership already
familiar with the particle methods in the context of the standard Bayes filter.
The focus in on the Bernoulli particle filter, the probability hypothesis
density (PHD) particle filter and the generalised labelled multi-Bernoulli
(GLMB) particle filter. The performance of the described filters is
demonstrated in the context of bearings-only target tracking application."
"We propose a novel distributed control architecture for the trajectory
tracking problem associated with a homogeneous string of nonlinear dynamical
agents. The scheme achieves velocity matching and collision avoidance, while
featuring a remarkable decoupling property of the closed-loop dynamics at each
autonomous agent."
"In this paper we aim to address the problem of dynamically dispatching a
group of state-of-the-art deloaded wind generators (WGs) in a fair-sharing
manner. We use the term dynamically since the WGs aim to dispatch themselves
according to a varying committed WF power output. We first propose a
leader-follower protocol whose execution guarantees asymptotically, two control
objectives. These are 1) reaching asymptotic consensus on the utilization level
of all WGs and 2) the total power output of the WGs asymptotically converges to
the reference value. Thereafter, we combine singular perturbation and Lyapunov
theory to prove that, under certain conditions, the proposed protocol will
asymptotically converge to its equilibrium. Finally, we derive a cooperative
Control Lyapunov Function-based (CLF) controller for the rotor side converter
(RSC) of each WG that realizes the protocol in practice. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed protocol and the corresponding RSC controller
design via simulations on the modified IEEE 24-bus RT system."
"In this paper we introduce a Leader-follower consensus protocol and study its
stability properties with and without communication delays. On the practical
side, we explore its application on coordinating a group of wind Double-Fed
Induction Generators (DFIGs) with integrated storage. To begin with, we
establish asymptotic stability of the consensus protocol by employing singular
perturbation theory. Subsequently, we establish asymptotic stability of the
protocol under communication delays using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional.
Lastly, we use the proposed protocol to design a methodology that can be
adopted by a fleet of state-of-the-art wind generators (WGs). The objective is
that the WGs selforganize and control their storage devices such that WF total
power output is tracking a reference while equal contribution from each storage
device is attained i.e equal power output from each storage. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our results and the corresponding approach via simulations on
the IEEE 24-bus RT system."
"The diffusion least-mean square (dLMS) algorithms have attracted much
attention owing to its robustness for distributed estimation problems. However,
the performance of such filters may change when they are implemented for
suppressing noises from speech signals. To overcome this problem, a diffusion
leaky dLMS algorithm is proposed in this work, which is characterized by its
numerical stability and small misadjustment for noisy speech signals when the
unknown system is a lowpass filter. Finally, two implementations of the leaky
dLMS are introduced. It is demonstrated that the leaky dLMS can be effectively
introduced into a noise reduction network for speech signals."
"The Jensen inequality has been recognized as a powerful tool to deal with the
stability of time-delay systems. Recently, a new inequality that encompasses
the Jensen inequality was proposed for the stability analysis of systems with
finite delays. In this paper, we first present a generalized integral
inequality and its double integral extension. It is shown how these
inequalities can be applied to improve the stability result for linear
continuous-time systems with gamma-distributed delays. Then, for the
discrete-time counterpart we provide an extended Jensen summation inequality
with infinite sequences, which leads to less conservative stability conditions
for linear discrete-time systems with poisson-distributed delays. The
improvements obtained thanks to the introduced generalized inequalities are
demonstrated by examples."
"This paper investigates the stakes of introducing probabilistic approaches
for the management of power system's security. In real-time operation, the aim
is to arbitrate in a rational way between preventive and corrective control,
while taking into account i) the prior probabilities of contingencies, ii) the
possible failure modes of corrective control actions, iii) the socio-economic
consequences of service interruptions. This work is a first step towards the
construction of a globally coherent decision making framework for security
management from long-term system expansion, via mid-term asset management,
towards short-term operation planning and real-time operation."
"Order-reduction is a standard automated approximation technique for
computer-aided design, analysis, and simulation of many classes of systems,
from circuits to buildings. For a given system, these methods produce a
reduced-order system where the dimension of the state-space is smaller, while
attempting to preserve behaviors similar to those of the full-order original
system. To be used as a sound abstraction for formal verification, a measure of
the similarity of behavior must be formalized and computed, which we develop in
a computational way for a class of linear systems and periodically-switched
systems as the main contributions of this paper. We have implemented the
order-reduction as a sound abstraction process through a source-to-source model
transformation in the HyST tool and use SpaceEx to compute sets of reachable
states to verify properties of the full-order system through analysis of the
reduced-order system. Our experimental results suggest systems with on the
order of a thousand state variables can be reduced to systems with tens of
state variables such that the order-reduction overapproximation error is small
enough to prove or disprove safety properties of interest using current
reachability analysis tools. Our results illustrate this approach is effective
to alleviate the state-space explosion problem for verification of
high-dimensional linear systems."
"For electro-optical imaging systems, line-of-sight stabilization against
different disturbances created by mobile platforms is crucial property. The
development of high resolution sensors and the demand in increased operating
distances have recently increased the expectations from stabilization loops.
For that reason, higher gains and larger bandwidths become necessary. As the
stabilization loop satisfies these requirements for good disturbance
attenuation, it must also satisfy sufficient loop stability. In gimbaled
imaging systems, the main difficulties in satisfying sufficient loop stability
are structural resonances and model uncertainties. Therefore, satisfying high
stabilization performance in the presence of model uncertainties or modeling
errors requires utilization of robust control methods. In this paper, robust
LQG/LTR controller design is described for a two-axis gimbal. First, the
classical LQG/LTR method is modified such that it becomes very powerful loop
shaping method. Next, using this method, controller is synthesized. Robust
stability and robust performance of stabilization loop is investigated by using
singular value tests. The report is concluded with the experimental validation
of the designed robust controller."
"Traditional power dispatch methods have difficulties in accommodating
large-scale variable renewable generation (VRG) and have resulted in
unnecessary VRG spillage in the practical industry. The recent
dispatchable-interval-based methods have the potential to reduce VRG
curtailment, but the dispatchable intervals are not allocated effectively due
to the lack of exploiting historical dispatch records of VRG units. To bridge
this gap, this paper proposes a novel data-driven real-time dispatch approach
to maximize VRG utili-zation by using do-not-exceed (DNE) limits. This approach
defines the maximum generation output ranges that the system can ac-commodate
without compromising reliability. The DNE limits of VRG units and operating
base points of conventional units are co-optimized by hybrid stochastic and
robust optimization, and the decision models are formulated as mixed-integer
linear programs by the sample average approximation technique exploiting
historical VRG data. A strategy for selecting historical data samples is also
proposed to capture the VRG uncertainty more accurately under variant
prediction output levels. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of
the proposed methods."
"In this paper we study both the value function and $\mathcal{Q}$-function
formulation of the Linear Programming (LP) approach to ADP. The approach
selects from a restricted function space to fit an approximate solution to the
true optimal Value function and $\mathcal{Q}$-function. Working in the
discrete-time, continuous-space setting, we extend and prove guarantees for the
fitting error and online performance of the policy, providing tighter bounds.
We provide also a condition that allows the $\mathcal{Q}$-function approach to
be more efficiently formulated in many practical cases."
"This study presents a generic TITOP (Two-Input Two-Output Port) model of a
substructure actuated with embedded piezoelectric materials as actuators
(PEAs), previously modeled with the FE technique. This allows intuitive
assembly of actuated flexible substructures in large flexible multi-body
systems. The modeling technique is applied to an illustrative example of a
flexible beam with bonded piezoelectric strip and vibration attenuation of a
chain of flexible beams."
"This paper investigates robust fault diagnosis of multiple air data sensor
faults in the presence of winds. The trade-off between robustness to winds and
sensitivity to faults is challenging due to simultaneous influence of winds and
latent faults on monitored sensors. Different from conventional residual
generators that do not consider any constraints, we propose a constrained
residual generator using moving horizon estimation. The main contribution is
improved fault sensitivity by exploiting known bounds on winds in residual
generation. By analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the formulated
moving horizon estimation problem, it is shown that this improvement is
attributed to active inequality constraints caused by faults. When the
weighting matrices in the moving horizon estimation problem are tuned to
increase robustness to winds, its fault sensitivity does not simply decrease as
one would expect in conventional unconstrained residual generators. Instead,
its fault sensitivity increases when the fault is large enough to activate some
inequality constraints. This fault sensitivity improvement is not restricted to
this particular application, but can be achieved by any general moving horizon
estimation based residual generator. A high-fidelity Airbus simulator is used
to illustrate the advantage of our proposed approach in terms of fault
sensitivity."
"This paper focuses on the control of a system composed of an Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) which cooperate to
manipulate an object. The two units are subject to actuator saturations and
cooperate to move the object to a desired pose, characterized by its position
and inclination. The paper proposes a control strategy where the ground vehicle
is tasked to deploy the object to a certain position, whereas the aerial
vehicle adjusts its inclination. The ground vehicle is governed by a saturated
proportional-derivative control law. The aerial vehicle is regulated by means
of a cascade control specifically designed for this problem that is able to
exploit the mechanical interconnection. The stability of the overall system is
proved through Input-to-State Stability and Small Gain theorem arguments. To
solve the problem of constraints satisfaction, a nonlinear Reference Governor
scheme is implemented. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method."
"We present new conditions to obtain synchronization and consensus patterns in
complex network systems. The key idea is to exploit symmetries of the nodes'
vector fields to induce a desired synchronization/consensus pattern, where
nodes are clustered in different groups each converging towards a different
synchronized evolution. We show that the new conditions we present offer a
systematic methodology to design a distributed network controller able to drive
a network of interest towards a desired synchronization/consensus pattern."
"This paper uses active learning to solve the problem of mining bounded-time
signal temporal requirements of cyber-physical systems or simply the
requirement mining problem. By utilizing robustness degree, we formulates the
requirement mining problem into two optimization problems, a parameter
synthesis problem and a falsification problem. We then propose a new active
learning algorithm called Gaussian Process Adaptive Confidence Bound (GP-ACB)
to help solving the falsification problem. We show theoretically that the
GP-ACB algorithm has a lower regret bound thus a larger convergence rate than
some existing active learning algorithms, such as GP-UCB. We finally illustrate
and apply our requirement mining algorithm on two case studies, the Ackley's
function and a real world automatic transmission model. The case studies show
that our mining algorithm with GP-ACB outperforms others, such as those based
on Nelder-Mead, by an average of 30% to 40%. Our results demonstrate that there
is a principled and efficient way of extracting requirements for complex
cyber-physical systems."
"The AgentSpeak type of languages are considered for decision making in
autonomous control systems. To reduce the complexity and increase the
verifiability of decision making, a limited instruction set agent (LISA) is
introduced. The new decision method is structurally simpler than its
predecessors and easily lends itself to both design time and runtime
verification methods. The process of converting a control agent in LISA into a
model in a probabilistic model checker is described. Due to the practical
complexity of design time verification the feasibility of runtime probabilistic
verification is investigated and illustrated in the LISA agent programming
system for verifying symbolic plans of the agent using a probabilistic model
checker."
"We discuss a recently introduced ECO-driving concept known as SPONGE in the
context of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Buses (PHEB)'s.Examples are given to
illustrate the benefits of this approach to ECO-driving. Finally, distributed
algorithms to realise SPONGE are discussed, paying attention to the privacy
implications of the underlying optimisation problems."
"We study supervisor localization for timed discrete-event systems under
partial observation and communication delay in the Brandin-Wonham framework.
First, we employ timed relative observability to synthesize a
partial-observation monolithic supervisor; the control actions of this
supervisor include not only disabling action of prohibitible events (as that of
controllable events in the untimed case) but also ""clock-preempting"" action of
forcible events. Accordingly we decompose the supervisor into a set of
partial-observation local controllers one for each prohibitible event, as well
as a set of partial-observation local preemptors one for each forcible event.
We prove that these local controllers and preemptors collectively achieve the
same controlled behavior as the partial-observation monolithic supervisor does.
Moreover, we propose channel models for inter-agent event communication and
impose bounded and unbounded delay as temporal specifications. In this
formulation, there exist multiple distinct observable event sets; thus we
employ timed relative coobservability to synthesize partial-observation
decentralized supervisors, and then localize these supervisors into local
controllers and preemptors. The above results are illustrated by a timed
workcell example."
"The main approaches for the formation of generalized conclusions about
operation quality of complex hierarchical network systems are analized.
Advantages and drawbacks of the ""weakest"" element method and a weighted linear
aggregation method are determined. Nonlinear aggregation method is proposed for
evaluating the quality of the systems, which consist of elements of the same
priority. Hybrid approaches to form generalized conclusions are developed based
on the main aggregation methods. It is shown that they allow to obtain more
reliable aggregation results."
