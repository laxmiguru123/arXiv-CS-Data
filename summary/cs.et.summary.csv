summary
"Our everyday data processing activities create massive amounts of data. Like
physical waste and trash, unwanted and unused data also pollutes the digital
environment by degrading the performance and capacity of storage systems and
requiring costly disposal. In this paper, we propose using the lessons from
real life waste management in handling waste data. We show the impact of waste
data on the performance and operational costs of our computing systems. To
allow better waste data management, we define a waste hierarchy for digital
objects and provide insights into how to identify and categorize waste data.
Finally, we introduce novel ways of reusing, reducing, and recycling data and
software to minimize the impact of data wastage"
"In this work we have proposed a geometric model that is employed to devise a
scheme for identifying the hotspots and zones in a chip. These spots or zone
need to be guarded thermally to ensure performance and reliability of the chip.
The model namely continuous unit sphere model has been presented taking into
account that the 3D region of the chip is uniform, thereby reflecting on the
possible locations of heat sources and the target observation points. The
experimental results for the - continuous domain establish that a region which
does not contain any heat sources may become hotter than the regions containing
the thermal sources. Thus a hotspot may appear away from the active sources,
and placing heat sinks on the active thermal sources alone may not suffice to
tackle thermal imbalance. Power management techniques aid in obtaining a
uniform power profile throughout the chip, but we propose an algorithm using
minimum bipartite matching where we try to move the sources minimally (with
minimum perturbation in the chip floor plan) near cooler points (blocks) to
obtain a uniform power profile due to diffusion of heat from hotter point to
cooler ones."
"Oligonucleotide arrays are used in a wide range of genomic analyses, such as
gene expression profiling, comparative genomic hybridization, chromatin
immunoprecipitation, SNP detection, etc. During fabrication, the sites of an
oligonucleotide array are selectively exposed to light in order to activate
oligonucleotides for further synthesis. Optical effects can cause unwanted
illumination at masked sites that are adjacent to the sites intentionally
exposed to light. This results in synthesis of unforeseen sequences in masked
sites and compromises interpretation of experimental data. To reduce such
uncertainty, one can exploit freedom in how probes are assigned to array sites.
The border length minimization problem (BLMP) seeks a placement of probes that
minimizes the sum of border lengths in all masks. In this paper, we propose two
parallel algorithms for the BLMP. The proposed parallel algorithms have the
local-search paradigm at their core, and are especially developed for the BLMP.
The results reported show that, for small microarrays with at most 1156 probes,
the proposed parallel algorithms perform better than the best previous
algorithms."
"The intent of the study detailed in this paper is to demonstrate the benefits
of inverter var control on a fast timescale to mitigate rapid and large voltage
fluctuations due to the high penetration of photovoltaic generation and the
resulting reverse power flow. Our approach is to formulate the volt/var control
as a radial optimal power flow (OPF) problem to minimize line losses and energy
consumption, subject to constraints on voltage magnitudes. An efficient
solution to the radial OPF problem is presented and used to study the structure
of optimal inverter var injection and the net benefits, taking into account the
additional cost of inverter losses when operating at non-unity power factor.
This paper will illustrate how, depending on the circuit topology and its
loading condition, the inverter's optimal reactive power injection is not
necessarily monotone with respect to their real power output. The results are
demonstrated on a distribution feeder on the Southern California Edison system
that has a very light load and a 5 MW photovoltaic (PV) system installed away
from the substation."
"We report on a new paradigm of information display that greatly extends the
utility and versatility of current optoelectronic displays. The main innovation
is to let a display of high refresh rate optically broadcast so-called atom
frames, which are designed through non-negative matrix factorization to form
bases for a class of images, and different viewers perceive selfintended images
by using display-synchronized viewing devices and their own human visual
systems to fuse appropriately weighted atom frames. This work is essentially a
scheme of temporal psychovisual modulation in visible spectrum, using an
optoelectronic modulator coupled with a biological demodulator."
"Due to high power consumption and difficulties with minimizing the CMOS
transistor size, molecular electronics has been introduced as an emerging
technology. Further, there have been noticeable advances in fabrication of
molecular wires and switches and also molecular diodes can be used for
designing different logic circuits. Considering this novel technology, we use
molecules as the active components of the circuit, for transporting electric
charge. In this paper, a full adder cell based on molecular electronics is
presented. This full adder is consisted of resonant tunneling diodes and
transistors which are implemented via molecular electronics. The area occupied
by this kind of full adder would be much times smaller than the conventional
designs and it can be used as the building block of more complex molecular
arithmetic circuits."
"Besides the lot of advantages offered by the 3D stacking of devices in an
integrated circuit there is a chance of device damage due to rise in peak
temperature value. Hence, in order to make use of all the potential benefits of
the vertical stacking a thermal aware design is very essential. The first step
for designing a thermal aware architecture is to analyze the hotspot
temperature generated by the devices. In this paper we are presenting the
results of our thermal analysis experiments of a 3D heterogeneous structure
with three layers. The bottom layer had eight identical processors at 2.4 GHz
and the top layer was with four memory units. The intermediate layer was a
thermal interface material (TIM). The 2D thermal analysis of the top and bottom
layers was also done separately. In the next step simulations were carried out
by varying TIM thickness and conductivity to study its affect on hotspot
temperature so as to optimize the temperature distribution."
"Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) refers to a field-effect
transistor that utilizes a single carbon nanotube or an array of carbon
nanotubes as the channel material instead of bulk silicon in the traditional
MOSFET structure. Since it was first demonstrated in 1998, there have been
tremendous developments in CNTFETs, which promise for an alternative material
to replace silicon in future electronics. Carbon nanotubes are promising
materials for the nano-scale electron devices such as nanotube FETs for
ultra-high density integrated circuits and quantum-effect devices for novel
intelligent circuits, which are expected to bring a breakthrough in the present
silicon technology.
  A Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is designed to plug two needs: i) The
SRAM provides as cache memory, communicating between central processing unit
and Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). ii) The SRAM technology act as driving
force for low power application since SRAM is portable compared to DRAM, and
SRAM doesn't require any refresh current. On the basis of acquired knowledge,
we present different SRAM's designed for the conventional CNTFET. HSPICE
simulations of this circuit using Stanford CNTFET model shows a great
improvement in power saving."
"Intra-body communication (IBC) is a type of Body Area Network (BAN)that
utilizes human body as the medium for data transmission. Thelow power
requirements of intra-body communication (IBC) as compared to near field
electromagnetic waves showed that it can be a suitable solution for Medical
Body Area Networks (MBANs) in a mobile health care system.In this paper, we
investigate the transmission characteristics of the human body as a conductor
of signals by considering different data transmission rates of multi-point to
point network in order to reduce overall power consumption of the
BAN.Furthermore, we utilize IBC and propose a new scheme to combines Slotted
ALOHA, TDMA, and Reservation ALOHA together to increase the throughput and
decrease the delay. By using our new hybrid scheme with the movable boundary
designed for health status monitoring, we are able to increase the efficiency
of data transmission by prioritizing the more critical data from the sensors."

"Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a novel and potentially attractive
technology for implementing computing architectures at the nanoscale. The basic
Boolean primitive in QCA is the majority gate. In this paper we present a novel
design for QCA cells and another possible and unconventional scheme for
majority gates. By applying these items, the hardware requirements for a QCA
design can be reduced and circuits can be simpler in level and gate counts. As
an example, a 1-bit QCA adder is constructed by applying our new scheme and is
compared to the other existing implementation. Beside, some Boolean functions
are expressed as examples and it has been shown, how our reduction method by
using new proposed item, decreases gate counts and levels in comparison to the
other previous methods."
"We present an active tile assembly model which extends Winfree's abstract
tile assembly model to tiles that are capable of transmitting and receiving
binding site activation signals. In addition, we introduce a mathematical
framework to address self-similarity and recursion within the model. The model
is applied to show a recursive assembly of an archetypal self-similar aperiodic
tiling known as the L-shape tiling."
"Digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips are now being extensively used to
automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis,
point-of-care diagnostics, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In many
biological assays, e.g., in bacterial susceptibility tests, samples and
reagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors,
satisfying certain ""gradient"" patterns such as linear, exponential, or
parabolic. Dilution gradients are usually prepared with continuous-flow
microfluidic devices; however, they suffer from inflexibility,
non-programmability, and from large requirement of costly stock solutions. DMF
biochips, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, a set of
random dilution factors. However, all existing algorithms fail to optimize the
cost or performance when a certain gradient pattern is required. In this work,
we present an algorithm to generate any arbitrary linear gradient, on-chip,
with minimum wastage, while satisfying a required accuracy in the concentration
factor. We present new theoretical results on the number of mix-split
operations and waste computation, and prove an upper bound on the storage
requirement. The corresponding layout design of the biochip is also proposed.
Simulation results on different linear gradients show a significant improvement
in sample cost over three earlier algorithms used for the generation of
multiple concentrations."
"We investigated the performance of spin transfer torque random access memory
(STT-RAM) cell with cross shaped Heusler compound based free layer using
micromagnetic simulations. We designed the free layer using Cobalt based
Heusler compounds. Here in this paper, simulation results predict that
switching time from one state to other state is reduced. Also it is examined
that critical switching current density to switch the magnetization of free
layer of STT RAM cell is reduced."
"We briefly introduce noise-based logic. After describing the main motivations
we outline classical, instantaneous (squeezed and non-squeezed), continuum,
spike and random-telegraph-signal based schemes with applications such as
circuits that emulate the brain functioning and string verification via a slow
communication channel."
"We report the first steps in creating an optical computing system. This
system may solve NP-Hard problems by utilizing a setup of exponential sized
masks. This is exponential space complexity but the production of those masks
is done with a polynomial time preprocessing. These masks are later used to
solve the problem in polynomial time. We propose to reduced the size of the
masks to nano-scaled density. Simulations were done to choose a proper design,
and actual implementations show the feasibility of such a system."
"Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNFET) is a promising new technology
that overcomes several limitations of traditional silicon integrated circuit
technology. In recent years, the potential of CNFET for analog circuit
applications has been explored. This paper proposes a novel four quadrant
analog multiplier design using CNFETs. The simulation based on 32nm CNFET
technology shows that the proposed multiplier has very low harmonic distortion
(<0.45%), large input range ({\pm}400mV), large bandwidth (~50GHz) and low
power consumption (~247{\mu}W), while operating at a supply voltage of
{\pm}0.9V."
"The Network-on-chip (NoC) designs consisting of large pack of Intellectual
Property (IP) blocks (cores) on the same silicon die is becoming technically
possible nowadays. But, the communication between the IP Cores is the main
issue in recent years. This paper presents the design of a Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) based wrapper interconnect as a component of System on
programmable chip (SOPC) builder to communicate between IP cores. In the
proposal, only bus lines that carry address and data signals are CDMA coded.
CDMA technology has better data integrity, channel continuity, channel
isolation, and also mainly it reduces the no.of lines in the bus architecture
for transmitting the data from master to slave."
"For Reversible computing, Target technology is yet to become available.
Adequate tools are not yet developed for reversible technology. Simulation is
still under development. Classical logic synthesis methods and simulation tools
can not be used in reversible computing. Because these work on irreversible
logic blocks but in reversible computing reversible logic blocks are used for
design and implementation. So, we need a simulation platform to analysis and
development in this area. So, we worked on this area and developed a GUI based
simulator. In the Dissertation work, we undertook simulation of RPGA,
reversible alternative to FPGA. We developed a RPGA simulator in our project.
RPGA simulator combines the technology of PLD/FPGA/SYSTOLIC array. Our RPGA
simulator, implements a given symmetric reversible Circuit on a RPGA structure.
We also worked on RPGA structure gates (picton and kerntopf gates) to develop a
better RPGA structure. Stepwise execution on RPGA structure is also performed
in RPGA simulator. We also designed new algorithms for Truth Table generation
and symmetry analysis. The dissertation work aims to develop entire simulator
is GUI based and easy to learn that makes it user friendly. User can easily
view all simulation results in GUI of our RPGA simulator."
"The term Big Data is usually used to describe huge amount of data that is
generated by humans from digital media such as cameras, internet, phones,
sensors etc. By building advanced analytics on the top of big data, one can
predict many things about the user such as behavior, interest etc. However
before one can use the data, one has to address many issues for big data
storage. Two main issues are the need of large storage devices and the cost
associated with it. Synthetic DNA storage seems to be an appropriate solution
to address these issues of the big data. Recently in 2013, Goldman and his
collegues from European Bioinformatics Institute demonstrated the use of the
DNA as storage medium with capacity of storing 2.2 peta bytes of information on
one gram of DNA and retrived the data successfully with low error rate. This
significant step shows a promise for synthetic DNA storage as a useful
technology for the future data storage. Motivated by this, we have developed a
software called DNACloud which makes it easy to store the data on the DNA. In
this work, we present detailed description of the software."
"Maintaining benefits of CMOS technology scaling is becoming challenging due
to increased manufacturing complexities and unwanted passive power
dissipations. This is particularly challenging in SRAM, where manufacturing
precision and leakage power control are critical issues. To alleviate some of
these challenges a novel non-volatile memory alternative to SRAM was proposed
called nanowire volatile RAM (NWRAM). Due to NWRAMs regular grid based layout
and innovative circuit style, manufacturing complexity is reduced and at the
same time considerable benefits are attained in terms of performance and
leakage power reduction. In this paper, we elaborate more on NWRAM circuit
aspects and manufacturability, and quantify benefits at 16nm technology node
through simulation against state-of-the-art 6T-SRAM and gridded 8T-SRAM
designs. Our results show the 10T-NWRAM to be 2x faster and 35x better in terms
of leakage when compared to high performance gridded 8T-SRAM design."
"The dark silicon problem, which limits the power-growth of future computer
generations, is interpreted as a heat energy transport problem when increasing
the energy emitting surface area within a given volume. A comparison of two
3D-configuration models, namely a standard slicing and a fractal surface
generation within the Menger sponge geometry is presented. It is shown, that
for iteration orders $n>3$ the fractal model shows increasingly better thermal
behavior. As a consequence cooling problems may be minimized by using a fractal
architecture. Therefore the Menger sponge geometry is a good example for
fractal architectures applicable not only in computer science, but also e.g. in
chemistry when building chemical reactors, optimizing catalytic processes or in
sensor construction technology building highly effective sensors for toxic
gases or water analysis."
"This paper presents a method for shaping the transmit pulse of a molecular
signal such that the diffusion channel's response is a sharp pulse. The impulse
response of a diffusion channel is typically characterised as having an
infinitely long transient response. This can cause severe
inter-symbol-interference, and reduce the achievable reliable bit rate. We
achieve the desired chemical channel response by poisoning the channel with a
secondary compound, such that it chemically cancels aspects of the primary
information signal. We use two independent methods to show that the chemical
concentration of the \emph{information signal} should be $\propto \delta(t)$
and that of the \emph{poison signal} should be $\propto t^{-3/2}$."
"Compressive displays are an emerging technology exploring the co-design of
new optical device configurations and compressive computation. Previously,
research has shown how to improve the dynamic range of displays and facilitate
high-quality light field or glasses-free 3D image synthesis. In this paper, we
introduce a new multi-mode compressive display architecture that supports
switching between 3D and high dynamic range (HDR) modes as well as a new
super-resolution mode. The proposed hardware consists of readily-available
components and is driven by a novel splitting algorithm that computes the pixel
states from a target high-resolution image. In effect, the display pixels
present a compressed representation of the target image that is perceived as a
single, high resolution image."
"It is noticed that the inductive and capacitive features of the memristor
reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very
presence in the resistive characteristic v = f(i) of the voltage and current
state variables, associated by their electrodynamics sense with electrical and
magnetic fields, forces any resister to cause to accumulate some magnetic and
electrostatic fields and energies around itself. The present version is
strongly extended in the sense of the circuit theory discussion."
"In the present era of technology computer has facilitated the human life up
to a great extent. The speed of computation has raised to astonish level but
the pace of development of other technologies which have core dependency over
computers have raised relatively exponentially huge, though the computer speed
of computation is very fast with respect to human abilities but still it has to
be increased a lot more to meet the future requirements. We have pushed
electrons to their maximum limit to a stage that nothing further could be
expected from electrons. Alternately one can use photon to replace the
relatively sluggish electrons. An alternate that posses all feature that an
electron holds but only millions of time faster and with a far more reliability
in one way or the other stretching the computers speed to a stage that no one
would have ever even wonder. In this research paper the photonics
implementations in computation industry have been presented along with its
scope as an alternate to electron with comparative study of electron and photon
under the computation perspective, generalized working of silicon based optical
computers, the application of photons and their crucial role in the upcoming
times. Keywords: Photonic Technology, H"
"Activity classification was performed using MEMS accelerometer and wireless
sensor node for wireless sensor network environment. Three axes MEMS
accelerometer measures body's acceleration and transmits measured data with the
help of sensor node to base station attached to PC. On the PC, real time
accelerometer data is processed for movement classifications. In this paper,
Rest, walking and running are the classified activities of the person. Both
time and frequency analysis was performed to classify running and walking. The
classification of rest and movement is done using Signal magnitude area (SMA).
The classification accuracy for rest and movement is 100%. For the
classification of walk and Run two parameters i.e. SMA and Median frequency
were used. The classification accuracy for walk and running was detected as
81.25% in the experiments performed by the test persons."
"This paper presents a technique for Informed Source Separation (ISS) of a
single channel mixture, based on the Multiple Input Spectrogram Inversion
method. The reconstruction of the source signals is iterative, alternating
between a time- frequency consistency enforcement and a re-mixing constraint. A
dual resolution technique is also proposed, for sharper transients
reconstruction. The two algorithms are compared to a state-of-the-art
Wiener-based ISS technique, on a database of fourteen monophonic mixtures, with
standard source separation objective measures. Experimental results show that
the proposed algorithms outperform both this reference technique and the oracle
Wiener filter by up to 3dB in distortion, at the cost of a significantly
heavier computation."
"In this paper we demonstrate the power of a model of tile self-assembly based
on active glues which can dynamically change state. We formulate the
Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), based on the model of Padilla, Liu,
and Seeman to be asynchronous, allowing any action of turning a glue on or off,
attaching a new tile, or breaking apart an assembly to happen in any order.
Within this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile
self-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile
Assembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for
substantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result
utilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly
of linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in
standard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal-passing tiles
simulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant
number of tiles per computation step. Our third system assembles the discrete
Sierpinski triangle, demonstrating that this pattern can be strictly
self-assembled within the STAM. This result is of particular interest in that
it is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well
studied tile self-assembly models. Notably, all of our constructions are at
temperature 1, further demonstrating that signal-passing confers the power to
bypass many restrictions found in standard tile assembly models."
"In this letter, a reactance-less mono-stable oscillator is introduced for the
first time using memristors. By replacing bulky inductors and capacitors with
memristors, the novel mono-stable oscillator can be an area-efficient solution
for on-chip fully integrated systems. The proposed circuit is described,
mathematically analysed and verified by circuit simulations."
"Turing presented a general representation scheme by which to achieve
artificial intelligence - unorganised machines. Significantly, these were a
form of discrete dynamical system and yet such representations remain
relatively unexplored. Further, at the same time as also suggesting that
natural evolution may provide inspiration for search mechanisms to design
machines, he noted that mechanisms inspired by the social aspects of learning
may prove useful. This paper presents initial results from consideration of
using Turing's dynamical representation within an unconventional substrate -
networks of Belousov-Zhabotinsky vesicles - designed by an imitation-based,
i.e., cultural, approach. Turing's representation scheme is also extended to
include a fuller set of Boolean functions at the nodes of the recurrent
networks."
"Conventional neuro-computing architectures and artificial neural networks
have often been developed with no or loose connections to neuroscience. As a
consequence, they have largely ignored key features of biological neural
processing systems, such as their extremely low-power consumption features or
their ability to carry out robust and efficient computation using massively
parallel arrays of limited precision, highly variable, and unreliable
components. Recent developments in nano-technologies are making available
extremely compact and low-power, but also variable and unreliable solid-state
devices that can potentially extend the offerings of availing CMOS
technologies. In particular, memristors are regarded as a promising solution
for modeling key features of biological synapses due to their nanoscale
dimensions, their capacity to store multiple bits of information per element
and the low energy required to write distinct states. In this paper, we first
review the neuro- and neuromorphic-computing approaches that can best exploit
the properties of memristor and-scale devices, and then propose a novel hybrid
memristor-CMOS neuromorphic circuit which represents a radical departure from
conventional neuro-computing approaches, as it uses memristors to directly
emulate the biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses. We point out the
differences between the use of memristors in conventional neuro-computing
architectures and the hybrid memristor-CMOS circuit proposed, and argue how
this circuit represents an ideal building block for implementing brain-inspired
probabilistic computing paradigms that are robust to variability and
fault-tolerant by design."
"Optical interconnect is seen as a potential solution to meet the performance
requirements of current and future generation of data processors. Optical
interconnects have negligible frequency dependent loss, low cross talk and high
band width. Optical interconnects are not much used commercially since optical
interconnects technology is incompatible with manufacturing processes and
assembly methods that are currently used in the semiconductor industry. There
are many promising optical interconnect technologies and this paper presents a
brief analysis of current state of optical interconnect technology."
"There is a growing body of work considering the use of representations based
upon genetic regulatory networks. This paper uses a recently presented
abstract, tunable Boolean regulatory network model to explore aspects of mobile
DNA, such as transposons, within these dynamical systems. The significant role
of mobile DNA in the evolution of natural systems is becoming increasingly
clear. Whilst operators loosely based upon transposons have previously been
used within evolutionary computation, their use within regulatory network
representations enables the potential exploitation of numerous new mechanisms.
This paper shows how dynamically controlling network node connectivity and
function via transposon-inspired mechanisms can be selected for under
non-stationary and coevolutionary scenarios, including when such changes are
heritable."
"Nature-inspired devices and architectures are attracting considerable
attention for various purposes, including the development of novel computing
techniques based on spatiotemporal dynamics, exploiting stochastic processes
for computing, and reducing energy dissipation. This paper demonstrates that
networks of optical energy transfers between quantum nanostructures mediated by
optical near-field interactions occurring at scales far below the wavelength of
light could be utilized for solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP),
the satisfiability problem (SAT), and a decision making problem. The optical
energy transfer from smaller quantum dots to larger ones, which is a quantum
stochastic process, depends on the existence of resonant energy levels between
the quantum dots or a state-filling effect occurring at the larger quantum
dots. Such a spatiotemporal mechanism yields different evolutions of energy
transfer patterns in multi-quantum-dot systems. We numerically demonstrate that
networks of optical energy transfers can be used for solution searching and
decision making. We consider that such an approach paves the way to a novel
physical informatics in which both coherent and dissipative processes are
exploited, with low energy consumption."
"DNA origami is an interdisciplinary area where DNA can be used as a building
block for making useful stuff at nanoscale. This work presents an open source
software DNA pen (based on the recent work of Peng Yin and his group) which can
be used (using free hand and digital molecular canvas) to draw an object at
nanoscale. Software generates error free DNA sequences which can be used in the
wet lab to create the object at the nanoscale. Using DNA pen we have drawn
several objects including the map of India and sanskrit letter ""Om"" from free
hand molecular canvas and digital letter DNA using digitized molecular canvas."
"The 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) is a tile-based self-assembly model in
which, typically beginning from single tiles, arbitrarily large aggregations of
static tiles combine in pairs to form structures. The Signal-passing Tile
Assembly Model (STAM) is an extension of the 2HAM in which the tiles are
dynamically changing components which are able to alter their binding domains
as they bind together. For our first result, we demonstrate useful techniques
and transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ tile set
into an STAM$^+$ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of
complexity, in terms of the number and types of ``signals'' they can send, with
a trade off in scale factor.
  Using these simplifications, we prove that for each temperature $\tau>1$
there exists a 3D tile set in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the
class of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\tau$ (where the STAM$^+$ does
not make use of the STAM's power of glue deactivation and assembly breaking, as
the tile components of the 2HAM are static and unable to change or break
bonds). This means that there is a single tile set $U$ in the 3D 2HAM which
can, for an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ system $S$, be configured with a
single input configuration which causes $U$ to exactly simulate $S$ at a scale
factor dependent upon $S$. Furthermore, this simulation uses only two planes of
the third dimension. This implies that there exists a 3D tile set at
temperature $2$ in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of
all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $1$. Moreover, we show that for each
temperature $\tau>1$ there exists an STAM$^+$ tile set which is intrinsically
universal for the class of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\tau$,
including the case where $\tau = 1$."
"RFID is a nascent technology, deeply rooted by its early developments in
using radar1 as a harbinger of adversary planes during World War II. A plethora
of industries have leveraged the benefits of RFID technology for enhancements
in sectors like military, sports, security, airline, animal farms, healthcare
and other areas. Industry specific key applications of this technology include
vehicle tracking, automated inventory management, animal monitoring, secure
store checkouts, supply chain management, automatic payment, sport timing
technologies, etc. This paper introduces the distinctive components of RFID
technology and focuses on its core competencies: scalability and security. It
will be then supplemented by a detailed synopsis of an investigation conducted
to test the feasibility and practicality of RFID technology."
"Recently, a tabletop molecular communication platform has been developed for
transmitting short text messages across a room. The end-to-end system impulse
response for this platform does not follow previously published theoretical
works because of imperfect receiver, transmitter, and turbulent flows.
Moreover, it is observed that this platform resembles a nonlinear system, which
makes the rich body of theoretical work that has been developed by
communication engineers not applicable to this platform. In this work, we first
introduce corrections to the previous theoretical models of the end-to-end
system impulse response based on the observed data from experimentation. Using
the corrected impulse response models, we then formulate the nonlinearity of
the system as noise and show that through simplifying assumptions it can be
represented as Gaussian noise. Through formulating the system's nonlinearity as
the output a linear system corrupted by noise, the rich toolbox of mathematical
models of communication systems, most of which are based on linearity
assumption, can be applied to this platform."
"Unconventional computing explores multi-scale platforms connecting
molecular-scale devices into networks for the development of scalable
neuromorphic architectures, often based on new materials and components with
new functionalities. We review some work investigating the functionalities of
locally connected networks of different types of switching elements as
computational substrates. In particular, we discuss reservoir computing with
networks of nonlinear nanoscale components. In usual neuromorphic paradigms,
the network synaptic weights are adjusted as a result of a training/learning
process. In reservoir computing, the non-linear network acts as a dynamical
system mixing and spreading the input signals over a large state space, and
only a readout layer is trained. We illustrate the most important concepts with
a few examples, featuring memristor networks with time-dependent and history
dependent resistances."
"Time shifts beyond the correlation time of the logic and reference signals
create new elements that are orthogonal to the original components. This fact
can be utilized to increase the number of dimensions of the logic space while
keeping the number of reference noises fixed. Using just a single noise and
time shifts can realize exponentially large hyperspaces with large numbers of
dimensions. Other, independent applications of time shifts include holographic
noise-based logic systems and changing commutative operations into
non-commuting ones. For the sake of simplicity, these ideas are illustrated by
deterministic time shifts, even though random timing and random time shifts
would yield the most robust systems."
"Printed electronics is quickly emerging with tremendous value in a wide
variety of latest electrical engineering areas. However, restricted to the
rather limited conductive inks and printing strategies, the currently existing
electronics manufacturing tools are generally complicated, expensive, time,
material, water and energy consuming, and thus mainly restricted to the
industrial use. Here from an alternative way, the present article demonstrated
for the first time an entirely automatic printing system for personal
electronics manufacturing through introducing a composite liquid metal ink
delivery and printing mechanism to overcome the large surface tension facing
the solution, and integrating it with the notebook computer controlling
algorithm. With the developed printer, any desired electronically conductive
patterns spanning from single wires to various complex structures like
integrated circuit (IC), antenna, PCB, RFID, electronic greeting cards,
decoration arts, classical buildings (White House, Great Wall etc.) or more
do-it-yourself (DIY) circuits were demonstrated to be printed out in a moment
with high precision. And the total cost for the whole system has reached
personal affordability, which is hard to offer by so far the state of the art
technologies. Some fundamental fluid dynamics mechanisms related to the
proposed tapping mode enabled reliable printing and adhesion of the liquid
metal electronics on the flexible substrate was systematically disclosed
through theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. This clearly
beyond-the-lab technology and pervasively available liquid metal printer opens
the way for large scale home level electronics making in the coming time."
"In previous work the chemotaxis towards simple organic chemicals was
assessed. We utilise the knowledge gained from these chemotactic assays to
route Physarum polycephalum at a series of junctions. By applying chemical
inputs at a simple T-junction we were able to reproducibly control the path
taken by the plasmodium of P. Polycephalum. Where the chemoattractant farnesene
was used at one input a routed signal could be reproducibly generated i.e. P.
Polycephalum moves towards the source of chemoattractant. Where the
chemoattractant was applied at both inputs the signal was reproducibly split.
If a chemorepellent was used then the signal was reproducibly suppressed. If no
chemical input was used in the simple circuit then a random signal was
generated, whereby P. Polycephalum would move towards one output at the
junction, but the direction was randomly selected. We extended this study to a
more complex series of T-junctions to explore further the potential of routing
P. Polycephalum. Although many of the circuits were completed effectively, any
errors from the implementation of the simple T-junction were magnified. There
were also issues with cascading effects through multiple junctions. For example
signal splitting could be reproducibly initiated at the first junction but not
at subsequent junctions. This work highlights the potential for exploiting
chemotaxis to achieve complex and reliable routing of P. Polycephalum signals.
This may be useful in implementing computing algorithms, design of autonomous
robots and directed material synthesis. In additional experiments we showed
that the application of chemoattractant compounds at specific locations on a
homogeneous substrate could be used to reliably control the spatial
configuration of P. Polycephalum. This may have applications in implementing
geometric calculations and in robot navigation tasks such as mapping chemical
plumes."
"Reversible logic circuit is a necessary construction for achieving ultra low
power dissipation as well as for prominent post-CMOS computing technologies
such as Quantum computing. Consequently automatic synthesis of a Boolean
function using elementary reversible logic gates has received significant
research attention in recent times, creating the domain of reversible logic
synthesis. In this paper, we study the complexity of reversible logic
synthesis. The problem is separately studied for bounded-ancilla and
ancilla-free optimal synthesis approaches. The computational complexity for
both cases are linked to known/presumed hard problems. Finally, experiments are
performed with a shortest-path based reversible logic synthesis approach and a
(0-1) ILP-based formulation."
"This paper describes the architecture of first and second generation current
conveyor (CCI and CCII respectively) and designing an amplifier using second
generation current conveyor. The designed amplifier through CCII+ can be used
in various analog computation circuits and is superior in performance than the
classical opamp. It provides better gain with higher accuracy."
"Many problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern/image
recognition, signal processing and machine learning generate massive amounts of
multidimensional data with multiple aspects and high dimensionality. Tensors
(i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact representation for
such massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank approximations. Big
data analytics require novel technologies to efficiently process huge datasets
within tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging technology for
multidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor networks (TNs) and
tensor decompositions (TDs) which represent tensors by sets of factor
(component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor analysis
allows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data and to
perform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect
relationships. We will discuss some fundamental TN models, their mathematical
and graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale
TDs and TNs, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection,
feature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and
integration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series
analysis and multiway component analysis.

"Physarum polycephalum is a macroscopic single celled plasmodial slime mould.
We employ plasmodial phototactic responses to construct laboratory prototypes
of NOT and NAND logical gates with electrical inputs/outputs and optical
coupling; the slime mould plays dual roles of computing device and electrical
conductor. Slime mould logical gates are fault tolerant and resettable. The
results presented here advance our understanding of how biological computing
substrates may be manipulated to implement logical operations and demonstrate
the feasibility of integrating living substrates into silicon hardware."
"Surface electrical potential and observational growth recordings were made of
a protoplasmic tube of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum in response to a
multitude of stimuli with regards to sensory fusion or multisensory
integration. Each stimulus was tested alone and in combination in order to
evaluate for the first time the effect that multiple stimuli have on the
frequency of streaming oscillation. White light caused a decrease in frequency
whilst increasing the temperature and applying a food source in the form of oat
flakes both increased the frequency. Simultaneously stimulating P. polycephalum
with light and oat flake produced no net change in frequency, while combined
light and heat stimuli showed an increase in frequency smaller than that
observed for heat alone. When the two positive stimuli, oat flakes and heat,
were combined, there was a net increase in frequency similar to the cumulative
increases caused by the individual stimuli. Boolean logic gates were derived
from the measured frequency change."
"Highly accurate and predictive models of resistive switching devices are
needed to enable future memory and logic design. Widely used is the memristive
modeling approach considering resistive switches as dynamical systems. Here we
introduce three evaluation criteria for memristor models, checking for
plausibility of the I-V characteristics, the presence of a sufficiently
non-linearity of the switching kinetics, and the feasibility of predicting the
behavior of two anti-serially connected devices correctly. We analyzed two
classes of models: the first class comprises common linear memristor models and
the second class widely used non-linear memristive models. The linear memristor
models are based on Strukovs initial memristor model extended by different
window functions, while the non-linear models include Picketts physics-based
memristor model and models derived thereof. This study reveals lacking
predictivity of the first class of models, independent of the applied window
function. Only the physics-based model is able to fulfill most of the basic
evaluation criteria."
"In this paper, we consider a molecular diffusion based communications link
that can reliably transport data over-the-air. We show that the system can also
reliably transport data across confined structural environments, especially in
cases where conventional electromagnetic (EM) wave based systems may fail. In
particular, this paper compares the performance of our proprietary molecular
communication test-bed with Zigbee wireless sensors in a metal pipe network
that does not act as a radio wave-guide. The paper first shows that a
molecular-based communication link's performance is determined primarily by the
delay time spread of the pulse response. The paper go on to show that
molecular-based systems can transmit more reliably in complex and confined
structural environments than conventional EM-based systems. The paper then
utilizes empirical data to find relationships between the received radio signal
strength, the molecular pulse spread, data rate (0.1 bits/s) and the structural
propagation environment."
"As we approach the physical limits of CMOS technology, advances in materials
science and nanotechnology are making available a variety of unconventional
computing substrates that can potentially replace top-down-designed
silicon-based computing devices. Inherent stochasticity in the fabrication
process and nanometer scale of these substrates inevitably lead to design
variations, defects, faults, and noise in the resulting devices. A key
challenge is how to harness such devices to perform robust computation. We
propose reservoir computing as a solution. In reservoir computing, computation
takes place by translating the dynamics of an excited medium, called a
reservoir, into a desired output. This approach eliminates the need for
external control and redundancy, and the programming is done using a
closed-form regression problem on the output, which also allows concurrent
programming using a single device. Using a theoretical model, we show that both
regular and irregular reservoirs are intrinsically robust to structural noise
as they perform computation."
"The Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) technology is a very promising
technique with which we can take the advantages of both waveguides and planar
transmission lines. Therefore, in [2.1-3] GHz band various microwave components
and devices have been designed successfully using Ansoft HFSS software. We then
proceeded to the realization of the coupler and then made measurements of the
frequency response in the range [2.1-3] GHz using a network analyzer. Thus,
results of this modeling are presented, discussed and allow to integrate these
devices in planar circuits."
"Quantum computers are considered as a future alternative to circumvent the
heat dissipation problem of VLSI circuits. The synthesis of reversible circuits
is a very promising area of study considering the expected further
technological advances towards quantum computing. In this report, we propose a
linear genetic programming system to design reversible circuits -RIMEP2-. The
system has evolved reversible circuits starting from scratch without resorting
to a pre-existing library. The results show that among the 26 considered
benchmarks, RIMEP2 outperformed the best published solutions for 20 of them and
matched the remaining 6. RIMEP2 is presented in this report as a promising
method with a considerable potential for reversible circuit design. It will be
considered as work reference for future studies based on this method."
"DNA self-assembly is a robust and programmable approach for building
structures at nanoscale. Researchers around the world have proposed and
implemented different techniques to build two dimensional and three dimensional
nano structures. One such technique involves the implementation of DNA Bricks
proposed by Ke et al., 2012 to create complex three-dimensional (3D)
structures. Modeling these DNA nano structures can prove to be a cumbersome and
tedious task. Exploiting the programmability of base-pairing to produce
self-assembling custom shapes, we present a software suite 3DNA, which can be
used for modeling, editing and visualizing such complex structures. 3DNA is an
open source software which works on the simple and modular self assembly of DNA
Bricks, offering a more intuitive better approach for constructing 3D shapes.
Apart from modeling and envisaging shapes through a simple graphical user
interface, 3DNA also supports an integrated random sequence generator that
generates DNA sequences corresponding to the designed model. The software is
available at www.guptalab.org/3dna"
"Emerging technologies with asymptotic zero power dissipation, such as quantum
computing, require the logical operations to be done in a reversible manner. In
recent years, the problem of synthesizing Boolean functions in the reversible
logic domain has gained significant research attention. The efficiency of the
synthesis methods is measured in terms of quantum cost, gate cost, garbage
lines, logic depth and speed of synthesis. In this paper, we present an
approach based on Exclusive sum-of-Products (ESOP), which allows the user to
explore the trade-off between quantum cost and garbage lines. The proposed
technique adds a new dimension to the reversible logic synthesis solutions. We
demonstrate by detailed experiments that controlled improvement in quantum cost
and gate count by increasing garbage count can be achieved. In some cases,
improved quantum cost and gate count compared to state-of-the-art synthesis
methods are reported. Furthermore, we propose a novel rule-based approach to
achieve ancilla-free reversible logic synthesis starting from an ESOP
formulation."
"Physarum polycephalum is a large single amoeba cell, which in its plasmodial
phase,forages and connects nearby food sources with protoplasmic tubes. The
organism forages for food by growing these tubes towards detected food stuffs,
this foraging behaviour is governed by simple rules of photoavoidance and
chemotaxis. The electrical activity of the tubes oscillates, creating a
peristaltic like action within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen;
the frequency of this oscillation controls the speed and direction of growth.
External stimuli such as light and food cause changes in the oscillation
frequency. We demonstrate that using these stimuli as logical inputs we can
approximate logic gates using these tubes and derive combinational logic
circuits by cascading the gates, with software analysis providing the output of
each gate and determining the input of the following gate. Basic gates OR, AND
and NOT were correct 90%, 77.8% and 91.7% of the time respectively. Derived
logic circuits XOR, Half Adder and Full Adder were 70.8%, 65% and 58.8%
accurate respectively. Accuracy of the combinational logic decreases as the
number of gates is increased, however they are at least as accurate as previous
logic approximations using spatial growth of Physarum polycephalum and up to 30
times as fast at computing the logical output. The results shown here
demonstrate a significant advancement in organism-based computing, providing a
solid basis for hybrid computers of the future."
"Reservoir computing is an information processing technique, derived from the
theory of neural networks, which is easy to implement in hardware. Several
reservoir computer hardware implementations have been realized recently with
performance comparable to digital implementations, which demonstrated the
potential of reservoir computing for ultrahigh bandwidth signal processing
tasks. In all these implementations however the signal pre-processing necessary
to efficiently address the reservoir was performed digitally. Here we show how
this digital pre-processing can be replaced by an analog input layer. We study
both numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be
replaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by
a sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy
to generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives
performance worse than state of the art. On the other hand, on many -but not
all- tasks, the modulation by two sines gives performances comparable to the
state of the art. The present work thus represents an important step towards
fully autonomous, ultrahigh bandwidth analog reservoir computers."
"Reconfiguration has been used for both defect- and fault-tolerant nanoscale
architectures with regular structure. Recent advances in self-assembled
nanowires have opened doors to a new class of electronic devices with irregular
structure. For such devices, reservoir computing has been shown to be a viable
approach to implement computation. This approach exploits the dynamical
properties of a system rather than specifics of its structure. Here, we extend
a model of reservoir computing, called the echo state network, to reflect more
realistic aspects of self-assembled nanowire networks. As a proof of concept,
we use echo state networks to implement basic building blocks of digital
computing: AND, OR, and XOR gates, and 2-bit adder and multiplier circuits. We
show that the system can operate perfectly in the presence of variations five
orders of magnitude higher than ITRS's 2005 target, $\bm{6\%}$, and achieves
success rates $\bm{6}$ times higher than related approaches at half the cost.
We also describe an adaptive algorithm that can detect faults in the system and
reconfigure it to resume perfect operational condition."
"Nanonetwork design and analysis has become a very interesting topic in recent
years. Though this area of research is in its formative stage, it definitely
posses a strong integrity in finding out numerous applications in medical and
allied sciences. Nanonetworking is indeed a nature built foundation which
comprises human intra body communications. Somatosensory system is the one of
the critical and must have systems of human body. This literature concentrates
on the body discriminative touch and proprioception mechanism of somatosensory
system. This particular system is well architecture by medial lemniscal
pathway, in human body for transduction of touch and proprioceptive
information. This paper seeks out the novel communication channel model of
somatosensory system. The working principle of the channel model is established
by an equivalent Moore machine. A novel algorithm MLP is proposed after its
name, medial lemniscal pathway. A novel naomachine and appropriate processing
unit are also devised, based on the automaton."
"We introduce the so far most efficient attack against the
Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange system. This attack
utilizes the lack of exact thermal equilibrium in practical applications and is
based on cable resistance losses and the fact that the Second Law of
Thermodynamics cannot provide full security when such losses are present. The
new attack does not challenge the unconditional security of the KLJN scheme,
but it puts more stringent demands on the security/privacy enhancing protocol
than for any earlier attack. In this paper we present a simple defense protocol
to fully eliminate this new attack by increasing the noise-temperature at the
side of the smaller resistance value over the noise-temperature at the at the
side with the greater resistance. It is shown that this simple protocol totally
removes Eve's information not only for the new attack but also for the old
Bergou-Scheuer-Yariv attack. The presently most efficient attacks against the
KLJN scheme are thereby completely nullified."
"This paper presents a heuristic cost minimization approach to synthesizing
linear reversible circuits. Two bidirectional linear reversible circuit
synthesis methods are introduced, the Alternating Elimination with Cost
Minimization method (AECM) and the Multiple CNOT Gate method (MCG). Algorithms,
example syntheses, and extensions to these methods are presented. An MCG
variant which incorporates line reordering is introduced. Tests comparing the
new cost minimization methods with the best known method for large circuits are
presented. Results show that of the three methods MCG had the lowest average
CNOT gate counts for linear reversible circuits up to 24 lines, and that AECM
had the lowest counts between 28 and 60 lines."
"In the last decades, great achievements have been made in the development of
computing machines. However, due to exponential growth of transistor density
and in particular due to tremendously increasing power consumption, researchers
expect that ""Conventional Technologies"" like Complementary Metal-Oxide
Semiconductor will reach their limits in near future. To further satisfy the
needs for more computational power, speed, less size etc. alternatives are
needed. Reversible Computation is the emerging field and alternative of
conventional technologies. Reversible Computation is emerging as a promising
solution and likely to work on extremely low power technologies and offer high
speed computations. The reversibility retains the capability to retrieve the
input data from output and minimizes heat dissipation. As migration to new
technology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the
acceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side
transformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge
to designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible
circuit was felt that can make a quick start and keep the development on track.
In this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on binary logic system
has been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in binary logic
system and output as reversible circuit. Entire environment is GUI based and
easy to learn user friendly. This tool offers editing, storage and conversion
into reversible facility."
"Nearby scalp channels in multi-channel EEG data exhibit high correlation. A
question that naturally arises is whether it is required to record signals from
all the electrodes in a group of closely spaced electrodes in a typical
measurement setup. One could save on the number of channels that are recorded,
if it were possible to reconstruct the omitted channels to the accuracy needed
for identifying the relevant information (say, spectral content in the signal),
required to carry out a preliminary diagnosis. We address this problem from a
compressed sensing perspective and propose a measurement and reconstruction
scheme. Working with publicly available EEG database, we put our scheme to
experiment and illustrate that if it is only a matter of estimating the
frequency content of the signal in various EEG bands, then all the channels
need not be recorded. We have achieved an average error below 15% between the
original and reconstructed signals with respect to estimation of the spectral
content in the delta, theta and alpha bands. We have demonstrated that channels
in the 10-10 system of electrode placement can be estimated, with an error less
than 10% using recordings on the sparser 10-20 system."
"Reversible sequential circuits are going to be the significant memory blocks
for the forthcoming computing devices for their ultra low power consumption.
Therefore design of various types of latches has been considered a major
objective for the researchers quite a long time. In this paper we proposed
efficient design of reversible sequential circuits that are optimized in terms
of quantum cost, delay and garbage outputs. For this we proposed a new 3*3
reversible gate called SAM gate and we then design efficient sequential
circuits using SAM gate along with some of the basic reversible logic gates."
"Reversible logic has come to the forefront of theoretical and applied
research today. Although many researchers are investigating techniques to
synthesize reversible combinational logic, there is little work in the area of
sequential reversible logic. Latches and flip-flops are the most significant
memory elements for the forthcoming sequential memory elements. In this paper,
we proposed two new reversible logic gates MG-1 and MG-2. We then proposed new
design techniques for latches and flip-flops with the help of the new proposed
gates. The proposed designs are better than the existing ones in terms of
number of gates, garbage outputs and delay."

"Computational theory and practice generally focus on single-paradigm systems,
but relatively little is known about how best to combine components based on
radically different approaches (e.g., silicon chips and wetware) into a single
coherent system. In particular, while testing strategies for single-technology
components are generally well developed, it is unclear at present how to
perform integration testing on heterotic systems: can we develop a test-set
generation strategy for checking whether specified behaviours emerge (and
unwanted behaviours do not) when components based on radically different
technologies are combined within a single system?
  In this paper, we describe an approach to modelling multi-technology
heterotic systems using a general-purpose formal specification strategy based
on Eilenberg's X-machine model of computation. We show how this approach can be
used to represent disparate technologies within a single framework, and propose
a strategy for using these formal models for automatic heterotic test-set
generation. We illustrate our approach by showing how to derive a test set for
a heterotic system combining an X-machine-based device with a cell-based P
system (membrane system)."
"In this paper we explore the power of geometry to overcome the limitations of
non-cooperative self-assembly. We define a generalization of the abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM), such that a tile system consists of a collection of
polyomino tiles, the Polyomino Tile Assembly Model (polyTAM), and investigate
the computational powers of polyTAM systems at temperature 1, where attachment
among tiles occurs without glue cooperation. Systems composed of the
unit-square tiles of the aTAM at temperature 1 are believed to be incapable of
Turing universal computation (while cooperative systems, with temperature > 1,
are able). As our main result, we prove that for any polyomino $P$ of size 3 or
greater, there exists a temperature-1 polyTAM system containing only shape-$P$
tiles that is computationally universal. Our proof leverages the geometric
properties of these larger (relative to the aTAM) tiles and their abilities to
effectively utilize geometric blocking of particular growth paths of
assemblies, while allowing others to complete.
  To round out our main result, we provide strong evidence that size-1 (i.e.
aTAM tiles) and size-2 polyomino systems are unlikely to be computationally
universal by showing that such systems are incapable of geometric bit-reading,
which is a technique common to all currently known temperature-1
computationally universal systems. We further show that larger polyominoes with
a limited number of binding positions are unlikely to be computationally
universal, as they are only as powerful as temperature-1 aTAM systems. Finally,
we connect our work with other work on domino self-assembly to show that
temperature-1 assembly with at least 2 distinct shapes, regardless of the
shapes or their sizes, allows for universal computation."
"Reversible logic represents the basis for many emerging technologies and has
recently been intensively studied. However, most of the Boolean functions of
practical interest are irreversible and must be embedded into a reversible
function before they can be synthesized. Thus far, an optimal embedding is
guaranteed only for small functions, whereas a significant overhead results
when large functions are considered. In this paper, we study this issue. We
prove that determining an optimal embedding is coNP-hard already for restricted
cases. Then, we propose heuristic and exact methods for determining both the
number of additional lines as well as a corresponding embedding. For the
approaches we considered sums of products and binary decision diagrams as
function representations. Experimental evaluations show the applicability of
the approaches for large functions. Consequently, the reversible embedding of
large functions is enabled as a precursor to subsequent synthesis."
"Noise-based logic is a practically deterministic logic scheme inspired by the
randomness of neural spikes and uses a system of uncorrelated stochastic
processes and their superposition to represent the logic state. We briefly
discuss various questions such as (i) What does practical determinism mean?
(ii) Is noise-based logic a Turing machine? (iii) Is there hope to beat (the
dreams of) quantum computation by a classical physical noise-based processor,
and what are the minimum hardware requirements for that? Finally, (iv) we
address the problem of random number generators and show that the common belief
that quantum number generators are superior to classical (thermal) noise-based
generators is nothing but a myth."
"A device based on current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) that functions as
an electronic neuron is proposed in this work. The SOT device implements an
artificial neuron's thresholding (transfer) function. In the first step of a
two-step switching scheme, a charge current places the magnetization of a
nano-magnet along the hard-axis i.e. an unstable point for the magnet. In the
second step, the SOT device (neuron) receives a current (from the synapses)
which moves the magnetization from the unstable point to one of the two stable
states. The polarity of the synaptic current encodes the excitatory and
inhibitory nature of the neuron input, and determines the final orientation of
the magnetization. A resistive crossbar array, functioning as synapses,
generates a bipolar current that is a weighted sum of the inputs. The
simulation of a two layer feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on
the SOT electronic neuron shows that it consumes ~3X lower power than a 45nm
digital CMOS implementation, while reaching ~80% accuracy in the classification
of one hundred images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset."
"Biological systems are known to communicate by diffusing chemical signals in
the surrounding medium. However, most of the recent literature has neglected
the electron transfer mechanism occurring amongst living cells, and its role in
cell-cell communication. Each cell relies on a continuous flow of electrons
from its electron donor to its electron acceptor through the electron transport
chain to produce energy in the form of the molecule adenosine triphosphate, and
to sustain the cell's vital operations and functions. While the importance of
biological electron transfer is well-known for individual cells, the past
decade has also brought about remarkable discoveries of multi-cellular
microbial communities that transfer electrons between cells and across
centimeter length scales, e.g., biofilms and multi-cellular bacterial cables.
These experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of
electron-based communications networks in microbial communities, which may
coexist with the more well-known communication strategies based on molecular
diffusion, while benefiting from a much shorter communication delay. This paper
develops a stochastic model that links the electron transfer mechanism to the
energetic state of the cell. The model is also extensible to larger
communities, by allowing for electron exchange between neighboring cells.
Moreover, the parameters of the stochastic model are fit to experimental data
available in the literature, and are shown to provide a good fit."
"Redox-based resistive switching devices (ReRAM) are an emerging class of
non-volatile storage elements suited for nanoscale memory applications. In
terms of logic operations, ReRAM devices were suggested to be used as
programmable interconnects, large-scale look-up tables or for sequential logic
operations. However, without additional selector devices these approaches are
not suited for use in large scale nanocrossbar memory arrays, which is the
preferred architecture for ReRAM devices due to the minimum area consumption.
To overcome this issue for the sequential logic approach, we recently
introduced a novel concept, which is suited for passive crossbar arrays using
complementary resistive switches (CRSs). CRS cells offer two high resistive
storage states, and thus, parasitic sneak currents are efficiently avoided.
However, until now the CRS-based logic-in-memory approach was only shown to be
able to perform basic Boolean logic operations using a single CRS cell. In this
paper, we introduce two multi-bit adder schemes using the CRS-based
logic-in-memory approach. We proof the concepts by means of SPICE simulations
using a dynamical memristive device model of a ReRAM cell. Finally, we show the
advantages of our novel adder concept in terms of step count and number of
devices in comparison to a recently published adder approach, which applies the
conventional ReRAM-based sequential logic concept introduced by Borghetti et
al."
"Reversible computing has attracted the attention of researchers due to its
low power consumption and less heat dissipation compared to conventional
computing. A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different
researchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have
been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible
logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available
because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing
feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits
have been reported in the literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed
the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate
suitable for sequential building block i.e. T flip-flop and hence designing low
cost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the
circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose
designs of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization
parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available
in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible
circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been
reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM.Because of
non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our
results cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the
sequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits,
handling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in
reverse direction by reversing the original output."
"With phenomenal growth of high speed and complex computing applications, the
design of low power and high speed logic circuits have created tremendous
interest. Conventional computing devices are based on irreversible logic and
further reduction in power consumption and/or increase in speed appears
non-promising. Reversible computing has emerged as a solution looking to the
power and speed requirements of future computing devices. In reversible
computing logic gates used are such that input can be generated by reversing
the operation from output. A number of reversible combinational circuits have
been developed but the growth of sequential circuits was not significant due to
feedback and fanout was not allowed. However, allowing feedback in space, a
very few sequential logic blocks i.e. flip-flops have been reported in
literature. In order to develop sequential circuits, flip-flops are used in
conventional circuits. Also good circuit design methods, optimized and fault
tolerant designs are also needed to build large, complex and reliable circuits
in conventional computing. Reversible flip-flops are the basic memory elements
that will be the building block of memory for reversible computing and quantum
computing devices. In this dissertation we plan to address above issues. First
we have proposed a Pareek gate suitable for low-cost flip-flops design and then
design methodology to develop flip-flops are illustrated. Further almost all
flip-flops and some example circuit have been developed and finally these
circuits have been converted into fault tolerant circuits by preserving their
parity and designs of offline as well as online testable circuits have been
proposed. In this dissertation work, we have also compared quantum cost as well
as other parameters with existing circuits and shown a significant improvement
in almost all parameters."
"With much advancement in the field of nanotechnology, bioengineering and
synthetic biology over the past decade, microscales and nanoscales devices are
becoming a reality. Yet the problem of engineering a reliable communication
system between tiny devices is still an open problem. At the same time, despite
the prevalence of radio communication, there are still areas where traditional
electromagnetic waves find it difficult or expensive to reach. Points of
interest in industry, cities, and medical applications often lie in embedded
and entrenched areas, accessible only by ventricles at scales too small for
conventional radio waves and microwaves, or they are located in such a way that
directional high frequency systems are ineffective. Inspired by nature, one
solution to these problems is molecular communication (MC), where chemical
signals are used to transfer information. Although biologists have studied MC
for decades, it has only been researched for roughly 10 year from a
communication engineering lens. Significant number of papers have been
published to date, but owing to the need for interdisciplinary work, much of
the results are preliminary. In this paper, the recent advancements in the
field of MC engineering are highlighted. First, the biological, chemical, and
physical processes used by an MC system are discussed. This includes different
components of the MC transmitter and receiver, as well as the propagation and
transport mechanisms. Then, a comprehensive survey of some of the recent works
on MC through a communication engineering lens is provided. The paper ends with
a technology readiness analysis of MC and future research directions."
"Self-sustaining nonlinear oscillators of practically any type can function as
latches and registers if Boolean logic states are represented physically as the
phase of oscillatory signals. Combinational operations on such phase-encoded
logic signals can be implemented using arithmetic negation and addition
followed by amplitude limiting. With these, general-purpose Boolean computation
using a wide variety of natural and engineered oscillators becomes potentially
possible. Such phase-encoded logic shows promise for energy efficient
computing. It also has inherent noise immunity advantages over traditional
level-based logic."
"The arrival of molecules in molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a
counting process, exhibiting by its nature binomial distribution. Even if the
binomial process describes well the arrival of molecules, when considering
consecutively sent symbols, the process struggles to work with the binomial
cumulative distribution function (CDF). Therefore, in the literature, Poisson
and Gaussian approximations of the binomial distribution are used. In this
paper, we analyze these two approximations of the binomial model of the arrival
process in MCvD with drift. Considering the distance, drift velocity, and the
number of emitted molecules, we investigate the regions in which either Poisson
or Gaussian model is better in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) of the
CDFs; we confirm the boundaries of the region via numerical simulations.
Moreover, we derive the error probabilities for continuous communication and
analyze which model approximates it more accurately."
"Frequency and phase of neural activity play important roles in the behaving
brain. The emerging understanding of these roles has been informed by the
design of analog devices that have been important to neuroscience, among them
the neuroanalog computer developed by O. Schmitt in the 1930's. In the 1950's,
J. von Neumann, in a search for high performance computing using microwaves,
invented a logic machine based on similar devices, that can perform logic
functions including binary arithmetic. Described here is a novel embodiment of
his machine using nano-magnetics. The embodiment is based on properties of
ferromagnetic thin films that are governed by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation
for magnetization in a film. Electrical currents through point contacts on a
film create spin torque nano oscillators (STNO) that define the oscillator
elements of the system. These oscillators may communicate through directed
graphs of electrical connections or by radiation in the form of spin waves. It
is shown here how to construct a logic machine using STNO, that this machine
can perform several computations simultaneously using multiplexing of inputs,
that this system can evaluate iterated logic functions, and that spin waves can
communicate frequency, phase and binary information. Neural tissue and the
Schmitt, von Neumann and STNO devices share a common bifurcation structure,
although these systems operate on vastly different space and time scales. This
suggests that neural circuits may be capable of computational functionality
described here."
"The term programmable matter refers to matter which has the ability to change
its physical properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical
properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or
autonomous sensing. This has many applications like smart materials, autonomous
monitoring and repair, and minimal invasive surgery. While programmable matter
might have been considered pure science fiction more than two decades ago, in
recent years a large amount of research has been conducted in this field. Often
programmable matter is envisioned as a very large number of small locally
interacting computational particles. We propose the Amoebot model, a new model
which builds upon this vision of programmable matter. Inspired by the behavior
of amoeba, the Amoebot model offers a versatile framework to model
self-organizing particles and facilitates rigorous algorithmic research in the
area of programmable matter. We present an algorithm for the problem of coating
an infinite object under this model, and prove the correctness of the algorithm
and that it is work-optimal."
"In Diffusion-based Molecular Communications, the channel between Transmitter
Nano-machine (TN) and Receiver Nano-machine (RN) can be modeled by Additive
Inverse Gaussian Channel, that is the first hitting time of messenger molecule
released from TN and captured by RN follows Inverse Gaussian distribution. In
this channel, a quantity-based modulation embedding message on the different
quantity levels of messenger molecules relies on a time-slotted system between
TN and RN. Accordingly, their clocks need to synchronize with each other. In
this paper, we discuss the approaches to make RN estimate its timing offset
between TN efficiently by the arrival times of molecules. We propose many
methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Unbiased Linear Estimation
(ULE), Iterative ULE, and Decision Feedback (DF). The numerical results shows
the comparison of them. We evaluate these methods by not only the Mean Square
Error, but also the computational complexity."
"Molecular communication promises to enable communication between nanomachines
with a view to increasing their functionalities and open up new possible
applications. Due to some of the biological properties, bacteria have been
proposed as a possible information carrier for molecular communication, and the
corresponding communication networks are known as \textit{bacterial
nanonetworks}. The biological properties include the ability for bacteria to
mobilize between locations and carry the information encoded in
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecules. However, similar to most organisms,
bacteria have complex social properties that govern their colony. These social
characteristics enable the bacteria to evolve through various fluctuating
environmental conditions by utilizing cooperative and non-cooperative
behaviors. This article provides an overview of the different types of
cooperative and non-cooperative social behavior of bacteria. The challenges
(due to non-cooperation) and the opportunities (due to cooperation) these
behaviors can bring to the reliability of communication in bacterial
nanonetworks are also discussed. Finally, simulation results on the impact of
bacterial cooperative social behavior on the end-to-end reliability of a
single-link bacterial nanonetwork are presented. The article concludes with
highlighting the potential future research opportunities in this emerging
field."
"The Phychip project is a collaborative European research initiative to design
and implement computation using the organism Physarum polycephalum; it is
funded by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) by the European Commission
within CORDIS and the FET Proactive scheme. Included in this presentation are
details the development of a Physarum based biosensor and biological logic
gate, offering significant advancements in the respective fields. The work
demonstrates the first steps towards Physarum computation and practical
Physarum Biosensor; subsequent work will focus on development of a hybrid
electronic-Physarum device capable of implementing computation."
"Despite all the progress of semiconductor integrated circuit technology, the
extreme complexity of the human cerebral cortex makes the hardware
implementation of neuromorphic networks with a comparable number of devices
exceptionally challenging. One of the most prospective candidates to provide
comparable complexity, while operating much faster and with manageable power
dissipation, are so-called CrossNets based on hybrid CMOS/memristor circuits.
In these circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several
crossbar layers, with adjustable two-terminal memristors at each crosspoint.
Recently, there was a significant progress in improvement of technology of
fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS
circuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical integration.
Separately, there have been several demonstrations of discrete memristors as
artificial synapses for neuromorphic networks. Very recently such experiments
were extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The
adjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each
crosspoint, and hence the prospects of their scaling are less impressive than
those of metal-oxide memristors, whose nonlinear I-V curves enable
transistor-free operation. Here we report the first experimental implementation
of a transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbar with device variability
lowered sufficiently to demonstrate a successful operation of a simple
integrated neural network, a single layer-perceptron. The network could be
taught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta-rule algorithm to
perform the perfect classification of 3x3-pixel black/white images into 3
classes. We believe that this demonstration is an important step towards the
implementation of much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic
networks."
"The paper discusses the gate complexity of reversible circuits consisting of
NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates. The Shannon gate complexity function $L(n, q)$ for
a reversible circuit, implementing a Boolean transformation $f\colon \mathbb
Z_2^n \to \mathbb Z_2^n$, is defined as a function of $n$ and the number of
additional inputs $q$. The general lower bound $L(n,q) \geq
\frac{2^n(n-2)}{3\log_2(n+q)} - \frac{n}{3}$ for the gate complexity of a
reversible circuit is proved. An upper bound $L(n,0) \leqslant
3n2^{n+4}(1+o(1)) \mathop / \log_2n$ for the gate complexity of a reversible
circuit without additional inputs is proved. An upper bound $L(n,q_0) \lesssim
2^n$ for the gate complexity of a reversible circuit with $q_0 \sim
n2^{n-o(n)}$ additional inputs is proved."
"A switched-capacitor (SC) neuromorphic system for closed-loop neural coupling
in 28 nm CMOS is presented, occupying 600 um by 600 um. It offers 128 input
channels (i.e. presynaptic terminals), 8192 synapses and 64 output channels
(i.e. neurons). Biologically realistic neuron and synapse dynam- ics are
achieved via a faithful translation of the behavioural equations to SC
circuits. As leakage currents significantly affect circuit behaviour at this
technology node, dedicated compensation techniques are employed to achieve
biological-realtime operation, with faithful reproduction of time constants of
several 100 ms at room temperature. Power draw of the overall system is 1.9 mW."
"Synaptic dynamics, such as long- and short-term plasticity, play an important
role in the complexity and biological realism achievable when running neural
networks on a neuromorphic IC. For example, they endow the IC with an ability
to adapt and learn from its environment. In order to achieve the mil- lisecond
to second time constants required for these synaptic dynamics, analog
subthreshold circuits are usually employed. However, due to process variation
and leakage problems, it is almost impossible to port these types of circuits
to modern sub-100nm technologies. In contrast, we present a neuromor- phic
system in a 28 nm CMOS process that employs switched capacitor (SC) circuits to
implement 128 short term plasticity presynapses as well as 8192 stop-learning
synapses. The neuromorphic system consumes an area of 0.36 mm2 and runs at a
power consumption of 1.9 mW. The circuit makes use of a technique for
minimizing leakage effects allowing for real-time operation with time constants
up to sev- eral seconds. Since we rely on SC techniques for all calculations,
the system is composed of only generic mixed-signal building blocks. These
generic building blocks make the system easy to port between technologies and
the large digital circuit part inherent in an SC system benefits fully from
technology scaling."
"Nanoelectronic devices that mimic the functionality of synapses are a crucial
requirement for performing cortical simulations of the brain. In this work we
propose a ferromagnet-heavy metal heterostructure that employs spin-orbit
torque to implement Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity. The proposed device
offers the advantage of decoupled spike transmission and programming current
paths, thereby leading to reliable operation during online learning. Possible
arrangement of such devices in a crosspoint architecture can pave the way for
ultra-dense neural networks. Simulation studies indicate that the device has
the potential of achieving pico-Joule level energy consumption (maximum 2 pJ
per synaptic event) which is comparable to the energy consumption for synaptic
events in biological synapses."
"Speed is a major concern for high density VLSI networks. In this paper the
closed form delay model for current mode signalling in VLSI interconnects has
been proposed with resistive load termination. RLC interconnect line is
modelled using characteristic impedance of transmission line and inductive
effect. The inductive effect is dominant at lower technology node is modelled
into an equivalent resistance. In this model first order transfer function is
designed using finite difference equation, and by applying the boundary
conditions at the source and load termination. It has been observed that the
dominant pole determines system response and delay in the proposed model. Using
CNIA tool (carbon nanotube interconnect analyzer) the interconnect line
parameters has been estimated at 45nm technology node. The novel proposed
current mode model superiority has been validated for CNT type of material. It
superiority factor remains to 66.66% as compared to voltage mode signalling.
And current mode dissipates 0.015pJ energy where as VM consume 0.045pJ for a
single bit transmission across the interconnect over CNT material. Secondly the
damping factor of a lumped RLC circuit is shown to be a useful figure of merit."
"Recently memristor-based applications and circuits are receiving an increased
attention. Furthermore, memristors are also applied in logic circuit design.
Material implication logic is one of the main areas with memristors. In this
paper an optimized memristor-based full adder design by material implication
logic is presented. This design needs 27 memristors and less area in comparison
with typical CMOS-based 8-bit full adders. Also the presented full adder needs
only 184 computational steps which enhance former full adder design speed by 20
percent."
"The paper discusses the asymptotic depth of a reversible circuit consisting
of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates. Reversible circuit depth function $D(n, q)$ for
a circuit implementing a transformation $f\colon \mathbb Z_2^n \to \mathbb
Z_2^n$ is introduced as a function of $n$ and the number of additional inputs
$q$. It is proved that for the case of implementing a permutation from
$A(\mathbb Z_2^n)$ with a reversible circuit having no additional inputs the
depth is bounded as $D(n, 0) \gtrsim 2^n / (3\log_2 n)$. It is proved that for
the case of implementing a transformation $f\colon \mathbb Z_2^n \to \mathbb
Z_2^n$ with a reversible circuit having $q_0 \sim 2^n$ additional inputs the
depth is bounded as $D(n, q_0) \lesssim 3n$."
"DNA Self-Assembly has emerged as an interdisciplinary field with many
intriguing applications such DNA bio-sensor, DNA circuits, DNA storage, drug
delivery etc. Tile assembly model of DNA has been studied for various
computational primitives such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Xuncai et. al. gave computational DNA tiles to perform division of a
number but the output had integer quotient. In this work, we simply modify
their method of division to improve its compatibility with further computation
and this modification has found its application in computing rational numbers,
both recurring and terminating, with computational tile complexity of
$\mathcal{O} (1)$ and $\mathcal{O} (h)$ respectively. Additionally, we also
propose a method to compute square-root of a number with computational tile
complexity of $\mathcal{O} (n)$ for an n bit number. Finally, after combining
tiles of division and square-root, we propose a simple way to compute the
ubiquitously used irrational number, $\pi$, using its infinite series."
"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) memristors exhibit complex conduction mechanism.
Several models of different complexity have been developed in order to mimic
the experimental results for physical behaviors observed in memristor devices.
Pickett's tunneling barrier model describes the TiO2 memristors, and utilizes
complex derivative of tunnel barrier width. It attains a large error in the ON
switching region. Variety of research consider it as the reference model for
the TiO2 memristors. In this paper, we first analyze the theory of operation of
the memristor and discuss Pickett's model. Then, we propose a modification to
its derivative functions to provide a lower error and closer agreement with
physical behavior. This modification is represented by two additional fitting
parameters to damp or accelerate the tunnel width derivative. Also, we
incorporate a hard limiter term to limit the tunnel width to its physical
extremes 1 nm and 2 nm. We run simulations to test the model modifications and
we compare the results to the experimental and original Pickett's model
results. The modified model more closely resembles the experimental behavior of
TiO2 memristors and potentially enables the memristor to be used as a
multilevel memory."
"We introduce a novel framework of reservoir computing, that is capable of
both connectionist machine intelligence and symbolic computation. Cellular
automaton is used as the reservoir of dynamical systems. Input is randomly
projected onto the initial conditions of automaton cells and nonlinear
computation is performed on the input via application of a rule in the
automaton for a period of time. The evolution of the automaton creates a
space-time volume of the automaton state space, and it is used as the
reservoir. The proposed framework is capable of long short-term memory and it
requires orders of magnitude less computation compared to Echo State Networks.
We prove that cellular automaton reservoir holds a distributed representation
of attribute statistics, which provides a more effective computation than local
representation. It is possible to estimate the kernel for linear cellular
automata via metric learning, that enables a much more efficient distance
computation in support vector machine framework. Also, binary reservoir feature
vectors can be combined using Boolean operations as in hyperdimensional
computing, paving a direct way for concept building and symbolic processing."
"In this paper, we investigate the abilities of systems of self-assembling
tiles which can each pass a constant number of signals to their immediate
neighbors to create replicas of input shapes. Namely, we work within the
Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), and we provide a universal STAM tile
set which is capable of creating unbounded numbers of assemblies of shapes
identical to those of input assemblies. The shapes of the input assemblies can
be arbitrary 2-dimensional hole-free shapes at scale factor 2. This greatly
improves previous shape replication results in self-assembly that required
models in which multiple assembly stages and/or bins were required, and the
shapes which could be replicated were quite constrained."
"In this paper, we propose an end-to-end channel model for molecular
communication systems with metal-oxide sensors. In particular, we focus on the
recently developed table top molecular communication platform. The system is
separated into two parts: the propagation and the sensor detection. There is
derived, based on this, a more realistic end-to-end channel model. However,
since some of the coefficients in the derived models are unknown, we collect a
great deal of experimental data to estimate these coefficients and evaluate how
they change with respect to the different system parameters. Finally, a noise
model is derived for the system to complete an end-to-end system model for the
tabletop platform."
"The plasmodium of slime mould Physarum polycephalum behaves as an amorphous
reaction-diffusion computing substrate and is capable of apparently intelligent
behaviour. But how does intelligence emerge in an acellular organism? Through a
range of laboratory experiments, we visualise the plasmodial cytoskeleton, a
ubiquitous cellular protein scaffold whose functions are manifold and essential
to life, and discuss its putative role as a network for transducing,
transmitting and structuring data streams within the plasmodium. Through a
range of computer modelling techniques, we demonstrate how emergent behaviour,
and hence computational intelligence, may occur in cytoskeletal communications
networks. Specifically, we model the topology of both the actin and tubulin
cytoskeletal networks and discuss how computation may occur therein.
Furthermore, we present bespoke cellular automata and particle swarm models for
the computational process within the cytoskeleton and observe the incidence of
emergent patterns in both. Our work grants unique insight into the origins of
natural intelligence; the results presented here are therefore readily
transferable to the fields of natural computation, cell biology and biomedical
science. We conclude by discussing how our results may alter our biological,
computational and philosophical understanding of intelligence and
consciousness."
"True slime mould Physarum polycephalum approximates a range of complex
computations via growth and adaptation of its proto- plasmic transport network,
stimulating a large body of recent research into how such a simple organism can
perform such complex feats. The properties of networks constructed by slime
mould are known to be in- fluenced by the local distribution of stimuli within
its environment. But can the morphological adaptation of slime mould yield any
information about the global statistical properties of its environment? We
explore this possibility using a particle based model of slime mould. We
demonstrate how morphological adaptation in blobs of virtual slime mould may be
used as a simple computational mechanism that can coarsely approx- imate
statistical analysis, estimation and tracking. Preliminary results include the
approximation of the geometric centroid of 2D shapes, ap- proximation of
arithmetic mean from spatially represented sorted and unsorted data
distributions, and the estimation and dynamical tracking of moving object
position in the presence of noise contaminated input stimuli. The results
suggest that it is possible to utilise collectives of very simple components
with limited individual computational ability (for ex- ample swarms of simple
robotic devices) to extract statistical features from complex datasets by means
of material adaptation and sensorial fusion."
"Using a particle model of Physarum displaying emer- gent morphological
adaptation behaviour we demonstrate how a minimal approach to collective
material computation may be used to transform and summarise properties of
spatially represented datasets. We find that the virtual material relaxes more
strongly to high-frequency changes in data which can be used for the smoothing
(or filtering) of data by ap- proximating moving average and low-pass filters
in 1D datasets. The relaxation and minimisation properties of the model enable
the spatial computation of B-spline curves (approximating splines) in 2D
datasets. Both clamped and unclamped spline curves, of open and closed shapes,
can be represented and the degree of spline curvature corresponds to the
relaxation time of the material. The material computation of spline curves also
includes novel quasi-mechanical properties including unwind- ing of the shape
between control points and a preferential adhesion to longer, straighter paths.
Interpolating splines could not directly be ap- proximated due to the formation
and evolution of Steiner points at nar- row vertices, but were approximated
after rectilinear pre-processing of the source data. This pre-processing was
further simplified by transform- ing the original data to contain the material
inside the polyline. These exemplar results expand the repertoire of spatially
represented uncon- ventional computing devices by demonstrating a simple,
collective and distributed approach to data and curve smoothing."
"Using a particle model of slime mould we demonstrate scoping experiments
which explore how path planning may be performed by morphological adaptation.
We initially demonstrate simple path planning by a shrinking blob of virtual
plasmodium between two attractant sources within a polygonal arena. We examine
the case where multiple paths are required and the subsequent selection of a
single path from multiple options. Collision-free paths are implemented via
repulsion from the borders of the arena. Finally, obstacle avoidance is
implemented by repulsion from obstacles as they are uncovered by the shrinking
blob. These examples show proof-of-concept results of path planning by
morphological adaptation which complement existing research on path planning in
novel computing substrates."
"In this paper, we propose a novel design for molecular communication in which
both the transmitter and the receiver have, in a 3-dimensional environment,
multiple bulges (in RF communication this corresponds to antenna). The proposed
system consists of a fluid medium, information molecules, a transmitter, and a
receiver. We simulate the system with a one-shot signal to obtain the channel's
finite impulse response. We then incorporate this result within our
mathematical analysis to determine interference. Molecular communication has a
great need for low complexity, hence, the receiver may have incomplete
information regarding the system and the channel state. Thus, for the cases of
limited information set at the receiver, we propose three detection algorithms,
namely adaptive thresholding, practical zero forcing, and Genie-aided zero
forcing."
"In this demonstration, we will present the world's first molecular
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication link to deliver two data
streams in a spatial domain. We show that chemical signals such as
concentration gradients could be used in MIMO fashion to transfer sequential
data. Until now it was unclear whether MIMO techniques, which are used
extensively in modern radio communication, could be applied to molecular
communication. In the demonstration, using our devised MIMO apparatus and
carefully designed detection algorithm, we will show that we can achieve about
1.7 times higher data rate than single input single output (SISO) molecular
communication systems."
"With increasing interest in millimeter wave wireless communications,
investigations on interactions between the human body and millimeter wave
devices are becoming important. This paper gives examples of current regulatory
requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the
propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human
body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are
considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the
body. Simulation results show that about 34% to 42% of the incident power is
reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is
not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are
used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation
of safety compliance is proposed in this paper."
"The giant single-celled amoeboid organism Physarum polycephalum constructs
minimising transport networks but can also approximate the Voronoi diagram
using two different mechanisms. In the first method Voronoi bisectors are rep-
resented by deformation of a pre-existing plasmodial network by repellent
sources acting as generating points. In the second method generating points act
as inoculation sites for grow- ing plasmodia and Voronoi bisectors are
represented by vacant regions before the plasmodia fuse. To explore the
behaviour of minimising networks in the presence of repulsion fields we utilise
a computational model of Physarum as a distributed virtual computing material.
We characterise the different types of computational behaviours elicited by
attraction and repulsion stimuli and demonstrate the approximation Voronoi
diagrams using growth towards attractants, avoidance of repellents, and
combinations of both. Approximation of Voronoi diagrams for point data sources,
complex planar shapes and circle sets is demonstrated. By altering repellent
con- centration we found that partition of data sources was maintained but the
internal network connectivity was minimised by the contractile force of the
transport network. To conclude, we find that the repertoire of unconventional
computation methods is enhanced by the addition of stimuli presented by
repellent fields, suggesting novel approaches to plane-division, packing, and
minimisation problems."
"Reversible Peres gates with more than two all over binary-valued control
signals are discussed. Methods are disclosed for the low cost realization of
this kind of Peres gates without requiring ancillary lines. Proper distribution
of the controlled gates and their inverses allow driving the reversible Peres
gate with control signals of different polarities."
"We consider programmable matter consisting of simple computational elements,
called particles, that can establish and release bonds and can actively move in
a self-organized way, and we investigate the feasibility of solving fundamental
problems relevant for programmable matter. As a suitable model for such
self-organizing particle systems, we will use a generalization of the geometric
amoebot model first proposed in SPAA 2014. Based on the geometric model, we
present efficient local-control algorithms for leader election and line
formation requiring only particles with constant size memory, and we also
discuss the limitations of solving these problems within the general amoebot
model."
"Many proposals have already been made for realizing programmable matter,
ranging from shape-changing molecules, DNA tiles, and synthetic cells to
reconfigurable modular robotics. Envisioning systems of nano-sensors devices,
we are particularly interested in programmable matter consisting of systems of
simple computational elements, called particles, that can establish and release
bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way, and in shape formation
problems relevant for programmable matter in those self-organizing particle
systems (SOPS). In this paper, we present a general algorithmic framework for
shape formation problems in SOPS, and show direct applications of this
framework to the problems of having the particle system self-organize to form a
hexagonal or triangular shape. Our algorithms utilize only local control,
require only constant-size memory particles, and are asymptotically optimal
both in terms of the total number of movements needed to reach the desired
shape configuration."
"Probabilistic graphical models are powerful mathematical formalisms for
machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty that are widely used for
cognitive computing. However they cannot be employed efficiently for large
problems (with variables in the order of 100K or larger) on conventional
systems, due to inefficiencies resulting from layers of abstraction and
separation of logic and memory in CMOS implementations. In this paper, we
present a magneto-electric probabilistic technology framework for implementing
probabilistic reasoning functions. The technology leverages Straintronic
Magneto-Tunneling Junction (S-MTJ) devices in a novel mixed-signal circuit
framework for direct computations on probabilities while enabling in-memory
computations with persistence. Initial evaluations of the Bayesian likelihood
estimation operation occurring during Bayesian Network inference indicate up to
127x lower area, 214x lower active power, and 70x lower latency compared to an
equivalent 45nm CMOS Boolean implementation."
"Reversible computation is one of the most promising emerging technologies of
the future. The usage of reversible circuits in computing devices can lead to a
significantly lower power consumption. In this paper we study reversible logic
circuits consisting of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates. We introduce a set $F(n,q)$
of all transformations $\mathbb Z_2^n \to \mathbb Z_2^n$ that can be
implemented by reversible circuits with $(n+q)$ inputs. We define the Shannon
gate complexity function $L(n,q)$ and the depth function $D(n,q)$ as functions
of $n$ and the number of additional inputs $q$. First, we prove general lower
bounds for functions $L(n,q)$ and $D(n,q)$. Second, we introduce a new group
theory based synthesis algorithm, which can produce a circuit $\mathfrak S$
without additional inputs and with the gate complexity $L(\mathfrak S) \leq 3n
2^{n+4}(1+o(1)) \mathop / \log_2 n$. Using these bounds, we state that almost
every reversible circuit with no additional inputs, consisting of NOT, CNOT and
2-CNOT gates, implements a transformation from $F(n,0)$ with the gate
complexity $L(n,0) \asymp n 2^n \mathop / \log_2 n$ and with the depth $D(n,0)
\geq 2^n(1-o(1)) \mathop / (3\log_2 n)$."
"This paper introduces a symbolic calculus to evaluate the output signals at
the target line(s) of quantum computing subcircuits using controlled negations
and controlled-Q gates, where Q represents the k-th root of [0 1; 1 0], the
unitary matrix of NOT, and k is a power of two. The controlling signals are
GF(2) expressions possibly including Boolean expressions. The method does not
require operating with complex-valued matrices. The method may be used to
verify the functionality and to check for possible minimization of a given
quantum computing circuit using target lines. The method does not apply for a
whole circuit if there are interactions among target lines. In this case the
method applies for the independent subcircuits."
"Traditional molecular communications via diffusion (MCvD) systems have used
baseband modulation techniques by varying properties of molecular pulses such
as the amplitude, the frequency of the transversal wave of the pulse, and the
time delay between subsequent pulses. In this letter, we propose and implement
passband modulation with molecules that exhibit longitudinal carrier wave
properties. This is achieved through the oscillation of the transmitter.
Frequency division multiplexing is employed to allow different molecular
information streams to co-exist in the same space and time channel, creating an
effective bandwidth for MCvD."
"System and synthetic biology are rapidly evolving systems, but both lack
tools such as those used in engineering environments to shift the their focus
from the design of parts (details) to the design of systems (behaviors); to
aggravate, there are insufficient theoretical justifications on the
computational limits of biological systems. To diminish these deficiencies, we
present theoretical results over the Turing-equivalence of metabolic systems,
defines rules for translations of algorithms into metabolic P systems and
presents a software tool to assist the task in an automatic way."
"In this paper we propose a methodology for deriving a model of a complex
system by exploiting the information extracted from Topological Data Analysis.
Central to our approach is the S[B] paradigm in which a complex system is
represented by a two-level model. One level, the structural S one, is derived
using the newly introduced quantitative concept of Persistent Entropy. The
other level, the behavioral B one, is characterized by a network of interacting
computational agents described by a Higher Dimensional Automaton. The
methodology yields also a representation of the evolution of the derived
two-level model as a Persistent Entropy Automaton. The presented methodology is
applied to a real case study, the Idiotypic Network of the mammal immune
system."
"Simple current mirrors with semiconductor resistive loads suffer from large
on-chip area, leakage currents and thermal effects. In this paper, we report
the feasibility of using memristive loads as a replacement of semiconductor
resistors in simplistic current mirror configuration. We report power, area and
total harmonic distribution, and report the corner conditions on resistance
tolerances."
"Practical memristor came into picture just few years back and instantly
became the topic of interest for researchers and scientists. Memristor is the
fourth basic two-terminal passive circuit element apart from well known
resistor, capacitor and inductor. Recently, memristor based architectures has
been proposed by many researchers. In this paper, we have designed a hybrid
Memristor-CMOS (MeMOS) logic based adder circuit that can be used in numerous
logic computational architectures. We have also analyzed the transient response
of logic gates designed using MeMOS logic circuits. MeMOS use CMOS 180 nm
process with memristor to compute boolean logic operations. Various parameters
including speed, ares, delay and power dissipation are computed and compared
with standard CMOS 180 nm logic design. The proposed logic shows better area
utilization and excellent results from existing CMOS logic circuits at standard
1.8 V operating voltage."
"A sub-excitable BZ medium responds to asymmetric local perturbation by
producing travelling localised excitation wave-fragments, distant relatives of
dissipative solitons. The size and life span of an excitation wave-fragment
depend on the illumination level of the medium. Under the right conditions the
wave-fragments conserve their shape and velocity vectors for extended time
periods. We interpret the wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. When
two or more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new
wave-fragment. States of the logic variables, represented by the
wave-fragments, are changed in the result of the collision between the
wave-fragments. Thus, a logical gate is implemented. Several theoretical
designs and experimental laboratory implementations of Boolean logic gates have
been proposed in the past but little has been done cascading the gates into
binary arithmetical circuits. We propose a unique design of a binary one-bit
full adder based on a fusion gate. A fusion gate is a two-input three-output
logical device which calculates conjunction of the input variables and
conjunction of one input variable with negation of another input variable. The
gate is made of three channels: two channels cross each other at an angle,
third channel starts at the junction. The channels contain BZ medium. When two
excitation wave-fragments, travelling towards each other along input channels,
collide at the junction they merge into a single wave-front travelling along
the third channel. If there is just one wave-front in the input channel, the
front continues its propagation undisturbed. We make a one-bit full adder by
cascading two fusion gates. We show how to cascade the adder blocks into a
many-bit full adder. We evaluate feasibility of our designs by simulating
evolution of excitation in the gates and adders using numerical integration of
Oregonator equations."
"Neuromorphic architectures offer great promise for achieving computation
capacities beyond conventional Von Neumann machines. The essential elements for
achieving this vision are highly scalable synaptic mimics that do not undermine
biological fidelity. Here we demonstrate that single solid-state TiO2
memristors can exhibit non-associative plasticity phenomena observed in
biological synapses, supported by their metastable memory state transition
properties. We show that, contrary to conventional uses of solid-state memory,
the existence of rate-limiting volatility is a key feature for capturing
short-term synaptic dynamics. We also show how the temporal dynamics of our
prototypes can be exploited to implement spatio-temporal computation,
demonstrating the memristors full potential for building biophysically
realistic neural processing systems."
"Passive crossbar arrays based upon memristive devices, at crosspoints, hold
great promise for the future high-density and non-volatile memories. The most
significant challenge facing memristive device based crossbars today is the
problem of sneak-path currents. In this paper, we investigate a memristive
device with intrinsic rectification behavior to suppress the sneak-path
currents in crossbar arrays. The device model is implemented in Verilog-A
language and is simulated to match device characteristics readily available in
the literature. Then, we systematically evaluate the read operation performance
of large-scale crossbar arrays utilizing our proposed model in terms of read
margin and power consumption while considering different crossbar sizes,
interconnect resistance values, HRS/LRS (High Resistance State/Low Resistance
State) values, rectification ratios and different read-schemes. The outcomes of
this study are understanding the trade-offs among read margin, power
consumption, read-schemes and most importantly providing a guideline for
circuit designers to improve the performance of a memory based crossbar
structure. In addition, read operation performance comparison of the intrinsic
rectifying memristive device model with other memristive device models are
studied."
"The measurement of the biological tissue's electrical impedance is an active
research field that has attracted a lot of attention during the last decades.
Bio-impedances are closely related to a large variety of physiological
conditions; therefore, they are useful for diagnosis and monitoring in many
medical applications. Measuring living tissues, however, is a challenging task
that poses countless technical and practical problems, in particular if the
tissues need to be measured under the skin. This paper presents a bio-impedance
sensor ASIC targeting a battery-free, miniature size, implantable device, which
performs accurate 4-point complex impedance extraction in the frequency range
from 2 kHz to 2 MHz. The ASIC is fabricated in 150 nm CMOS, has a size of 1.22
mm x 1.22 mm and consumes 165 uA from a 1.8 V power supply. The ASIC is
embedded in a prototype which communicates with, and is powered by an external
reader device through inductive coupling. The prototype is validated by
measuring the impedances of different combinations of discrete components,
measuring the electrochemical impedance of physiological solution, and
performing ex vivo measurements on animal organs. The proposed ASIC is able to
extract complex impedances with around 1 Ohm resolution; therefore enabling
accurate wireless tissue measurements."
"Resistive switches are a class of emerging nanoelectronics devices that
exhibit a wide variety of switching characteristics closely resembling
behaviors of biological synapses. Assembled into random networks, such
resistive switches produce emerging behaviors far more complex than that of
individual devices. This was previously demonstrated in simulations that
exploit information processing within these random networks to solve tasks that
require nonlinear computation as well as memory. Physical assemblies of such
networks manifest complex spatial structures and basic processing capabilities
often related to biologically-inspired computing. We model and simulate random
resistive switch networks and analyze their computational capacities. We
provide a detailed discussion of the relevant design parameters and establish
the link to the physical assemblies by relating the modeling parameters to
physical parameters. More globally connected networks and an increased network
switching activity are means to increase the computational capacity linearly at
the expense of exponentially growing energy consumption. We discuss a new
modular approach that exhibits higher computational capacities and energy
consumption growing linearly with the number of networks used. The results show
how to optimize the trade-off between computational capacity and energy
efficiency and are relevant for the design and fabrication of novel computing
architectures that harness random assemblies of emerging nanodevices."
"The paper discusses various applications of permutation group theory in the
synthesis of reversible logic circuits consisting of Toffoli gates with
negative control lines. An asymptotically optimal synthesis algorithm for
circuits consisting of gates from the NCT library is described. An algorithm
for gate complexity reduction, based on equivalent replacements of gates
compositions, is introduced. A new approach for combining a group-theory-based
synthesis algorithm with a Reed-Muller-spectra-based synthesis algorithm is
described. Experimental results are presented to show that the proposed
synthesis techniques allow a reduction in input lines count, gate complexity or
quantum cost of reversible circuits for various benchmark functions."
"Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) are promising candidates
for building energy-efficient digital systems at highly-scaled technology
nodes. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to variations
that reduce circuit yield, increase susceptibility to noise, and severely
degrade their anticipated energy and speed benefits. Joint exploration and
optimization of CNT processing options and CNFET circuit design are required to
overcome this outstanding challenge. Unfortunately, existing approaches for
such exploration and optimization are computationally expensive, and mostly
rely on trial-and-error-based ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we present a
framework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay
and noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processing
options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.
We demonstrate that our framework: 1) runs over 100x faster than existing
approaches, and 2) accurately identifies the most important CNT processing
parameters, together with CNFET circuit design parameters (e.g., for CNFET
sizing and standard cell layouts), to minimize the impact of CNT variations on
CNFET circuit speed with less than 5% energy cost, while simultaneously meeting
circuit-level noise margin and yield constraints."
"The advent of advanced neuronal interfaces offers great promise for linking
brain functions to electronics. A major bottleneck in achieving this is
real-time processing of big data that imposes excessive requirements on
bandwidth, energy and computation capacity; limiting the overall number of
bio-electronic links. Here, we present a novel monitoring system concept that
exploits the intrinsic properties of memristors for processing neural
information in real time. We demonstrate that the inherent voltage thresholds
of solid-state TiOx memristors can be useful for discriminating significant
neural activity, i.e. spiking events, from noise. When compared with a
multi-dimensional, principal component feature space threshold detector, our
system is capable of recording the majority of significant events, without
resorting to computationally heavy off-line processing. We also show a
memristive integrating sensing array that discriminates neuronal activity
recorded in-vitro. We prove that information on spiking event amplitude is
simultaneously transduced and stored as non-volatile resistive state
transitions, allowing for more efficient data compression, demonstrating the
memristors' potential for building scalable, yet energy efficient on-node
processors for big data."
"This article examines recent research in molecular communications from a
telecommunications system design perspective. In particular, it focuses on
channel models and state-of-the-art physical layer techniques. The goal is to
provide a foundation for higher layer research and motivation for research and
development of functional prototypes. In the first part of the article, we
focus on the channel and noise model, comparing molecular and radio-wave
pathloss formulae. In the second part, the article examines, equipped with the
appropriate channel knowledge, the design of appropriate modulation and error
correction coding schemes. The third reviews transmitter and receiver side
signal processing methods that suppress inter-symbol-interference. Taken
together, the three parts present a series of physical layer techniques that
are necessary to producing reliable and practical molecular communications."
"We introduce information-theoretic erasure based on Shannon's binary channel
formula. It is pointed out that this type of erasure is a natural
energy-dissipation-free way in which information is lost in
double-potential-well memories, and it may be the reason why the brain can
forget things effortlessly. We also demonstrate a new non-volatile,
charge-based memory scheme wherein the erasure can be associated with even
negative energy dissipation; this implies that the memory's environment is
cooled during information erasure and contradicts Landauer's principle of
erasure dissipation. On the other hand, writing new information into the memory
always requires positive energy dissipation in our schemes. Finally, we show a
simple system where even a classical erasure process yields negative energy
dissipation of arbitrarily large energy."
"Building oscillator based computing systems with emerging nano-device
technologies has become a promising solution for unconventional computing tasks
like computer vision and pattern recognition. However, simulation and analysis
of these systems is both time and compute intensive due to the nonlinearity of
new devices and the complex behavior of coupled oscillators. In order to speed
up the simulation of coupled oscillator systems, we propose a simplified phase
model to perform phase and frequency synchronization prediction based on a
synthesis of earlier models. Our model can predict the frequency locking
behavior with several orders of magnitude speedup compared to direct
evaluation, enabling the effective and efficient simulation of the large
numbers of oscillators required for practical computing systems."
"Microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation,plant
growth,human and animal digestion,global elemental cycles including the
carbon-cycle,and water treatment.They are also posed to be the engines of
renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of
electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms
used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand
interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help
control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial
capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from
communications,networking and information theory can play a role in
understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of
interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum
sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily
studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell
interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new
frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which
may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular
diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical
compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population
size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing
models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models
for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent
randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models
allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of
interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to
complexity reduction."
"We consider how to generate chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from functional
specifications. We propose a two-stage approach that combines synthesis by
satisfiability modulo theories and Markov chain Monte Carlo based optimisation.
First, we identify candidate CRNs that have the possibility to produce correct
computations for a given finite set of inputs. We then optimise the reaction
rates of each CRN using a combination of stochastic search techniques applied
to the chemical master equation, simultaneously improving the of correct
behaviour and ruling out spurious solutions. In addition, we use techniques
from continuous time Markov chain theory to study the expected termination time
for each CRN. We illustrate our approach by identifying CRNs for majority
decision-making and division computation, which includes the identification of
both known and unknown networks."
"Molecular communications (MC), where molecules are used to encode, transmit,
and receive information, is a promising means of enabling the coordination of
nanoscale devices. The paradigm has been extensively studied from various
aspects, including channel modeling and noise analysis. Comparatively little
attention has been given to the physical design of molecular receiver and
transmitter, envisioning biological synthetic cells with intrinsic molecular
reception and transmission capabilities as the future nanomachines. However,
this assumption leads to a discrepancy between the envisaged applications
requiring complex communication interfaces and protocols, and the very limited
computational capacities of the envisioned biological nanomachines. In this
paper, we examine the feasibility of designing a molecular receiver, in a
physical domain other than synthetic biology, meeting the basic requirements of
nanonetwork applications. We first review the state-of-the-art biosensing
approaches to determine whether they can inspire a receiver design. We reveal
that nanoscale field effect transistor based electrical biosensor technology
(bioFET) is a particularly useful starting point for designing a molecular
receiver. Focusing on bioFET-based molecular receivers with a conceptual
approach, we provide a guideline elaborating on their operation principles,
performance metrics and design parameters. We then provide a simple model for
signal flow in silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based molecular receiver. Lastly, we
discuss the practical challenges of implementing the receiver and present the
future research avenues from a communication theoretical perspective."
"This paper presents models for transforming standard reversible circuits into
Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) architecture without inserting SWAP gates.
Templates to optimize the transformed LNN circuits are proposed. All minimal
LNN circuits for all 3-qubit functions have been generated to serve as
benchmarks to evaluate heuristic optimization algorithms. The minimal results
generated are compared with optimized LNN circuits obtained from the post
synthesis algorithm --- template matching with LNN templates. Experiments show
that the suggested synthesis flow significantly improves the quantum cost of
circuits."
"Nano-scale molecular communication is a viable way of exchanging information
between nano-machines. In this letter, a low-complexity and non-coherent signal
detection technique is proposed to mitigate the inter-symbol-interference (ISI)
and additive noise. In contrast to existing coherent detection methods of high
complexity, the proposed non-coherent signal detector is more practical when
the channel conditions are hard to acquire accurately or hidden from the
receiver. The proposed scheme employs the concentration difference to detect
the ISI corrupted signals and we demonstrate that it can suppress the ISI
effectively. The concentration difference is a stable characteristic,
irrespective of the diffusion channel conditions. In terms of complexity, by
excluding matrix operations or likelihood calculations, the new detection
scheme is particularly suitable for nano-scale molecular communication systems
with a small energy budget or limited computation resource."
"For the past four decades, cost and features have driven CMOS scaling. Severe
lithography and material limitations seen below the 20 nm node, however, are
challenging the fundamental premise of affordable CMOS scaling. Just continuing
to co-optimize leaf cell circuit and layout designs with process technology
does not enable us to exploit the challenges of a sub-20 nm CMOS. For
affordable scaling it is imperative to work past sub-20 nm technology
impediments while exploiting its features. To this end, we propose to broaden
the scope of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) to be more holistic by
including micro-architecture design and CAD, along with circuits, layout and
process technology. Applying such holistic DTCO to the most significant block
in a system-on-chip (SoC), embedded memory, we can synthesize smarter and
efficient embedded memory blocks that are customized to application needs.
  To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed holistic DTCO process, we designed,
fabricated and tested several design experiments in a state-of-the-art IBM
14SOI process. DTCOed leaf cells, standard cells and SRAM bitcells were robust
during testing, but failed to meet node to node area scaling requirements.
Holistic DTCO, when applied to a widely used parallel access SRAM sub-block,
consumed 25% less area with a 50% better performance per watt compared to a
traditional implementation using compiled SRAM blocks and standard cells. To
extend the benefits of holistic DTCO to other embedded memory intensive
sub-blocks in SoCs, we developed a readily customizable smart memory synthesis
framework (SMSF). We believe that such an approach is important to establish an
affordable path for sub-20 nm scaling."
"The potential of memristive devices is often seeing in implementing
neuromorphic architectures for achieving brain-like computation. However, the
designing procedures do not allow for extended manipulation of the material,
unlike CMOS technology, the properties of the memristive material should be
harnessed in the context of such computation, under the view that biological
synapses are memristors. Here we demonstrate that single solid-state TiO2
memristors can exhibit associative plasticity phenomena observed in biological
cortical synapses, and are captured by a phenomenological plasticity model
called triplet rule. This rule comprises of a spike-timing dependent plasticity
regime and a classical hebbian associative regime, and is compatible with a
large amount of electrophysiology data. Via a set of experiments with our
artificial, memristive, synapses we show that, contrary to conventional uses of
solid-state memory, the co-existence of field- and thermally-driven switching
mechanisms that could render bipolar and/or unipolar programming modes is a
salient feature for capturing long-term potentiation and depression synaptic
dynamics. We further demonstrate that the non-linear accumulating nature of
memristors promotes long-term potentiating or depressing memory transitions."
"Reversible logic has attracted substantial interest due to its low power
consumption which is the main concern of low power VLSI circuit design. In this
paper, a novel 4x4 reversible gate called inventive gate has been introduced
and using this gate 1-bit, 2-bit, 8-bit, 32-bit and n-bit group-based
reversible comparator have been constructed with low value of reversible
parameters. The MOS transistor realizations of 1-bit, 2- bit, and 8-bit of
reversible comparator are also presented and finding power, delay and power
delay product (PDP) with appropriate aspect ratio W/L. Novel inventive gate has
the ability to use as an n-to-2n decoder. Different proposed novel reversible
circuit design style is compared with the existing ones. The relative results
shows that the novel reversible gate wide utility, group-based reversible
comparator outperforms the present design style in terms of number of gates,
garbage outputs and constant input."
"It is assumed that each nano-robot has a 0.1{\mu}m3 tankage which is far
smaller than the volume of a human red blood cell[6]. Thus, the nano-machines
are non-invasive for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and disease
diagnosis. Since the nano-machine has an initial source of 108 molecules in its
own tankage and since the throughput of the DMC systems is significantly low;
we propose and discuss some ideas to boost the throughput with emphasize of
reducing the emitted no. of molecules per message."
"Over the past decade Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have emerged as one of the
popular architectures to emulate the brain. In SNN, information is temporally
encoded and communication between neurons is accomplished by means of spikes.
In such networks, spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms require the
online programming of synapses based on the temporal information of spikes
transmitted by spiking neurons. In this work, we propose a spintronic synapse
with decoupled spike transmission and programming current paths. The spintronic
synapse consists of a ferromagnet-heavy metal heterostructure where programming
current through the heavy metal generates spin-orbit torque to modulate the
device conductance. Low programming energy and fast programming times
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed device as a nanoelectronic synapse. We
perform a simulation study based on an experimentally benchmarked
device-simulation framework to demonstrate the interfacing of such spintronic
synapses with CMOS neurons and learning circuits operating in transistor
sub-threshold region to form a network of spiking neurons that can be utilized
for pattern recognition problems."
"Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to mimic the computations
performed in the neurons and the synapses in the human brain in order to
achieve its efficiency in learning and cognitive tasks. In this work, we
demonstrate the mapping of the probabilistic spiking nature of pyramidal
neurons in the cortex to the stochastic switching behavior of a Magnetic Tunnel
Junction in presence of thermal noise. We present results to illustrate the
efficiency of neuromorphic systems based on such probabilistic neurons for
pattern recognition tasks in presence of lateral inhibition and homeostasis.
Such stochastic MTJ neurons can also potentially provide a direct mapping to
the probabilistic computing elements in Belief Networks for performing
regenerative tasks."
"Non-Boolean computing based on emerging post-CMOS technologies can
potentially pave the way for low-power neural computing platforms. However,
existing work on such emerging neuromorphic architectures have either focused
on solely mimicking the neuron, or the synapse functionality. While memristive
devices have been proposed to emulate biological synapses, spintronic devices
have proved to be efficient at performing the thresholding operation of the
neuron at ultra-low currents. In this work, we propose an All-Spin Artificial
Neural Network where a single spintronic device acts as the basic building
block of the system. The device offers a direct mapping to synapse and neuron
functionalities in the brain while inter-layer network communication is
accomplished via CMOS transistors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of a neural architecture where a single nanoelectronic
device is able to mimic both neurons and synapses. The ultra-low voltage
operation of low resistance magneto-metallic neurons enables the low-voltage
operation of the array of spintronic synapses, thereby leading to ultra-low
power neural architectures. Device-level simulations, calibrated to
experimental results, was used to drive the circuit and system level
simulations of the neural network for a standard pattern recognition problem.
Simulation studies indicate energy savings by ~ 100x in comparison to a
corresponding digital/ analog CMOS neuron implementation."
"Molecular Communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on
the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices. MC
has been extensively studied from various aspects in the literature; however,
the physical design of MC transceiving units is largely neglected with the
assumption that network nodes are entirely biological devices, e.g., engineered
bacteria, which are intrinsically capable of receiving and transmitting
molecular messages. However, the low information processing capacity of
biological devices and the challenge to interface them with macroscale networks
hinder the true application potential of nanonetworks. To overcome this
problem, recently, we proposed a nanobioelectronic MC receiver architecture
exploiting the nanoscale field effect transistor-based biosensor (bioFET)
technology, which provides noninvasive and sensitive molecular detection while
producing electrical signals as the output. In this paper, we introduce a
comprehensive model for silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receivers by
integrating the underlying processes in MC and bioFET to provide a unified
analysis framework. We derive closed-form expressions for noise statistics,
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver output, and symbol error
probability (SEP). Performance evaluation in terms of SNR and SEP reveals the
effects of individual system parameters on the detection performance of the
proposed MC receiver."
"Synaptic memory is considered to be the main element responsible for learning
and cognition in humans. Although traditionally non-volatile long-term
plasticity changes have been implemented in nanoelectronic synapses for
neuromorphic applications, recent studies in neuroscience have revealed that
biological synapses undergo meta-stable volatile strengthening followed by a
long-term strengthening provided that the frequency of the input stimulus is
sufficiently high. Such ""memory strengthening"" and ""memory decay""
functionalities can potentially lead to adaptive neuromorphic architectures. In
this paper, we demonstrate the close resemblance of the magnetization dynamics
of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) to short-term plasticity and long-term
potentiation observed in biological synapses. We illustrate that, in addition
to the magnitude and duration of the input stimulus, frequency of the stimulus
plays a critical role in determining long-term potentiation of the MTJ. Such
MTJ synaptic memory arrays can be utilized to create compact, ultra-fast and
low power intelligent neural systems."
"In this letter, we propose for the first time a method of abstracting the PPV
(Perturbation Projection Vector) characteristic of the up-to-date
memristor-based oscillators. Inspired from biological oscillators and its
characteristic named PRC (Phase Response Curve), we build a bridge between PRC
and PPV. This relationship is verified rigorously using the transistor level
simulation of Colpitts and ring oscillators, i.e., comparing the PPV converted
from PRC and the PPV obtained from accurate PSS+PXF simulation. Then we apply
this method to the PPV calculation of the memristor-based oscillator. By
keeping the phase dynamics of the oscillator and dropping the details of
voltage/current amplitude, the PPV modelling is highly efficient to describe
the phase dynamics due to the oscillator coupling, and will be very suitable
for the fast simulation of large scale oscillatory neural networks."
"The giant single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum has inspired rapid
develop- ments in unconventional computing substrates since the start of this
century. This is primarily due to its simple component parts and the
distributed nature of the computation which it approximates during its growth,
foraging and adaptation to a changing environment. Slime mould functions as a
living embodied computational material which can be influenced (or pro-
grammed) by the placement of external stimuli. The goal of exploiting this
material behaviour for unconventional computation led to the development of a
multi-agent approach to the ap- proximation of slime mould behaviour. The basis
of the model is a simple dynamical pattern formation mechanism which exhibits
self-organised formation and subsequent adaptation of collective transport
networks. The system exhibits emergent properties such as relaxation and
minimisation and it can be considered as a virtual computing material,
influenced by the external application of spatial concentration gradients. In
this paper we give an overview of this multi-agent approach to unconventional
computing. We describe its computational mechanisms and different generic
application domains, together with concrete example ap- plications of material
computation. We examine the potential exploitation of the approach for
computational geometry, path planning, combinatorial optimisation, data
smoothing and statistical applications."
"Could simple organisms such as slime mould approximate LI without recourse to
neural tissue? We describe a model whereby LI can emerge without explicit
inhibitory wiring, using only bulk transport effects. We use a multi-agent
model of slime mould to reproduce the char- acteristic edge contrast
amplification effects of LI using excitation via attractant based stimuli. We
also explore a counterpart behaviour, Lateral Activation (where stimulated
regions are inhibited and lateral regions are excited), using simulated
exposure to light irradiation. In both cases restoration of baseline activity
occurs when the stimuli are removed. In addition to the enhancement of local
edge contrast the long-term change in population density distribution
corresponds to a collective response to the global brightness of 2D image
stimuli, including the scalloped inten- sity profile of the Chevreul staircase
and the perceived difference of two identically bright patches in the
Simultaneous Brightness Contrast (SBC) effect. This simple
modelapproximatesLIcontrastenhancementphenomenaandglobalbrightnessper- ception
in collective unorganised systems without fixed neural architectures. This may
encourage further research into unorganised analogues of neural processes in
simple organisms and suggests novel mechanisms to generate collective
perception of contrast and brightness in distributed computing and robotic
devices."
"The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is known to construct proto- plasmic
transport networks which approximate proximity graphs by forag- ing for
nutrients during its plasmodial life cycle stage. In these networks, nodes are
represented by nutrients and edges are represented by proto- plasmic tubes.
These networks have been shown to be efficient in terms of length and
resilience of the overall network to random damage. However relatively little
research has been performed in the potential for Physarum transport networks to
approximate the overall shape of a dataset. In this paper we distinguish
between connectivity and shape of a planar point dataset and demonstrate, using
scoping experiments with plasmodia of P. polycephalum and a multi-agent model
of the organism, how we can gen- erate representations of the external and
internal shapes of a set of points. As with proximity graphs formed by P.
polycephalum, the behaviour of the plasmodium (real and model) is mediated by
environmental stimuli. We further explore potential morphological computation
approaches with the multi-agent model, presenting methods which approximate the
Convex Hull and the Concave Hull. We demonstrate how a growth parameter in the
model can be used to transition between Convex and Concave Hulls. These results
suggest novel mechanisms of morphological computation mediated by environmental
stimuli."
"Computing devices are composed of spatial arrangements of simple funda-
mental logic gates. These gates may be combined to form more complex adding
circuits and, ultimately, complete computer systems. Implementing classical
adding circuits using unconventional, or even living substrates such as slime
mould Physarum polycephalum, is made difficult and often impracti- cal by the
challenges of branching fan-out of inputs and regions where circuit lines must
cross without interference. In this report we explore whether it is possible to
avoid spatial propagation, branching and crossing completely in the design of
adding circuits. We analyse the input and output patterns of a single-bit full
adder circuit. A simple quantitative transformation of the input patterns which
considers the total number of bits in the input string allows us to map the
respective input combinations to the correct outputs patterns of the full adder
circuit, reducing the circuit combinations from a 2:1 mapping to a 1:1 mapping.
The mapping of inputs to outputs also shows an incremental linear progression,
suggesting its implementation in a range of physical systems. We demonstrate an
example implementation, first in simulation, inspired by self-oscillatory
dynamics of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We then assess the
potential implementation using plasmodium of slime mould itself. This simple
transformation may enrich the potential for using unconventional computing
substrates to implement digital circuits."
"P. polycephalum may be considered as a spatially represented parallel
unconventional computing substrate, but how can this `computer' be programmed?
In this paper we examine and catalogue individual low-level mechanisms which
may be used to induce network formation and adaptation in a multi-agent model
of P. polycephalum. These mechanisms include those intrinsic to the model
(particle sensor angle, rotation angle, and scaling parameters) and those
mediated by the environment (stimulus loca- tion, distance, angle,
concentration, engulfment and consumption of nutrients, and the presence of
simulated light irradiation, repellents and obstacles). The mechanisms in- duce
a concurrent integration of chemoattractant and chemorepellent gradients
diffusing within the 2D lattice upon which the agent population resides,
stimulating growth, move- ment, morphological adaptation and network
minimisation. Chemoattractant gradients, and their modulation by the engulfment
and consumption of nutrients by the model population, represent an efficient
outsourcing of spatial computation. The mechanisms may prove useful in
understanding the search strategies and adaptation of distributed organisms
within their environment, in understanding the minimal requirements for com-
plex adaptive behaviours, and in developing methods of spatially programming
parallel unconventional computers and robotic devices."
"We develop novel methods for device-free localization (DFL) using
transceivers in motion. Such localization technologies are useful in various
cross-layer applications/protocols including those that are related to security
situations where it is important to know the presence and position of an
unauthorized person; in monitoring the daily activities of elderly or special
needs individuals; or in emergency situations when police or firefighters can
use the locations of people inside of a building in order to save lives. We
propose that transceivers mounted on autonomous vehicles could be both quickly
deployed and kept moving to ``sweep'' an area for changes in the channel that
would indicate the location of moving people and objects. The challenge is that
changes to channel measurements are introduced both by changes in the
environment and from motion of the transceivers. In this paper, we demonstrate
a method to detect human movement despite transceiver motion using
ultra-wideband impulse radar (UWB-IR) transceivers. The measurements reliably
detect a person's presence on a link line despite small-scale fading. We
explore via multiple experiments the ability of mobile UWB-IR transceivers,
moving outside of the walls of a room, to measure many lines crossing through
the room and accurately locate a person inside within 0.25 m average error."
"Very simple organisms, such as the single-celled amoeboid slime mould
Physarum polycephalum possess no neural tissue yet, despite this, are known to
exhibit complex biological and computational behaviour. Given such limited
resources, can environmental stimuli play a role in generating the complexity
of slime mould behaviour? We use a multi-agent collective model of slime mould
to explore a two-way mechanism where the collective behaviour is influenced by
simulated chemical concentration gradient fields and, in turn, this behaviour
alters the spatial pattern of the concentration gradients. This simple
mechanism yields complex behaviour amid the dynamically changing gradient
profiles and suggests how the apparently intelligent response of the slime
mould could possibly be due to outsourcing of computation to the environment."
"Lateral Inhibition (LI) phenomena occur in a wide range of sensory modalities
and are most famously described in the human visual system. In LI the activity
of a stimulated neuron is itself excited and suppresses the activity of its
local neighbours via inhibitory connections, increasing the contrast between
spatial environmental stimuli. Simple or- ganisms, such as the single-celled
slime mould Physarum polycephalum possess no neural tissue yet, despite this,
are known to exhibit complex computational behaviour. Could simple organisms
such as slime mould approximate LI without recourse to neural tissue? We
describe a model whereby LI can emerge without explicit inhibitory wiring,
using only bulk transport effects. We use a multi-agent virtual material model
of slime mould to reproduce the characteristic contrast amplification response
of LI using excitation via attractant stimuli. Restoration of baseline activ-
ity occurs when the stimuli are removed. We also explore an opposite
counterpart behaviour, Lateral Activation (LA), using repellent stimuli. These
preliminary results suggest that simple organisms without neural tissue may
approximate sensory contrast enhancement using alternative analogues of LI and
suggests novel approaches towards generating collec- tive contrast enhancement
in distributed computing and robotic devices."
"Collective movement occurs in living systems where the simple movements of
individual members of a pop- ulation are combined to generate movement of the
collective as a whole, displaying complex dynamics which cannot be found in the
component parts themselves. The plasmodium stage of slime mould Physarum
polycephalum displays complex amoeboid movement during its foraging and hazard
avoidance and its movement can be influenced by the spatial placement of
attractant and repellent stimuli. Slime mould is attractive to robotics due to
its simple component parts and the distributed nature of its control and
locomotion mechanisms. We investigate methods of automated guidance of a
multi-agent swarm collective along a pre-defined path to a goal location. We
demonstrate a closed-loop feedback mechanism using attractant and repellent
stimuli. We find that guidance by repellent stimuli (a light illumination mask)
provides faster and more accurate guidance than attractant sources, which
exhibit overshooting phenomena at path turns. The method allows traversal of
convoluted arenas with challenging obstacles and provides an insight into how
unconven- tional computing substrates may be hybridised with classical
computing methods to take advantage of the benefits of both approaches."
"Purpose: Protoplasmic tubes of Physarum polycephalum, also know as Physarum
Wires (PW), have been previously suggested as novel bio- electronic components.
Until recently, practical examples of electronic circuits using PWs have been
limited. These PWs have been shown to be self repairing, offering significant
advantage over traditional electronic components. This article documents work
performed to produce practical circuits using PWs. Method: We have demonstrated
through manufacture and testing of hybrid circuits that PWs can be used to
produce a variety of practical electronic circuits. A purality of different
applications of PWs have been tested to show the universality of PWs in
analogue and digital electronics. Results: Voltage dividers can be produced
using a pair of PWs in series with an output voltage accurate to within 12%.
PWs can also transmit analogue and digital data with a frequency of up to 19
kHz, which with the addition of a buffer, can drive high current circuits. We
have demonstrated that PWs can last approximately two months, a 4 fold increase
on previous literature. Protoplasmic tubes can be modified with the addition of
conductive or magnetic nano-particles to provide changes in functionality.
Conclusion This work has documented novel macro-scale data transmission through
biological material; it has advanced the field of bio-electronics by providing
a cheap and easy to grow conducting bio-material which may be used in future
hybrid electronic technology."
"Memristor-based oscillator is becoming promising thanks to its inherent NDR
(Negative Differential Region) property and compact circuit structure. This
paves the way to the large scale oscillatory neural network (ONN) and the
realization of pattern recognition based on its global synchronization.
However, the simulation of large scale ONN encounters the problem of long
simulation time because of the large number of oscillators. Here we propose a
highly efficient method to abstract the phase sensitivity characteristic of the
memristor-based oscillator, i.e., its PPV (Perturbation Projection Vector),
which allows reducing considerably the complexity of ONN simulation, and
speeding up the simulation more than 2000 times. Our study also reveals the
impact of the circuit parameters on the pattern recognition accuracy and the
robustness against the frequency mismatch."
"With ever increasing research on magnetic nano systems it is shown to have
great potential in the areas of magnetic storage, biosensing, magnetoresistive
insulation etc. In the field of biosensing specifically Spin Valve sensors
coupled with Magnetic Nanolabels is showing great promise due to noise immunity
and energy efficiency [1]. In this paper we present the application of
injection locked based Spin Torque Nano Oscillator (STNO) suitable for high
resolution energy efficient labeled DNA Detection. The proposed STNO microarray
consists of 20 such devices oscillating at different frequencies making it
possible to multiplex all the signals using capacitive coupling. Frequency
Division Multiplexing can be aided with Time division multiplexing to increase
the device integration and decrease the readout time while maintaining the same
efficiency in presence of constant input referred noise."
"We implement several non-binary logic systems using the spin dynamics of
nuclear spins in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR system is a suitable
test system because of its high degree of experimental control; findings from
NMR implementations are relevant for other computational platforms exploiting
particles with spin, such as electrons or photons. While we do not expect the
NMR system to become a practical computational device, it is uniquely useful to
explore strengths and weaknesses of unconventional computational approaches,
such as non-binary logic."
"In this paper, we propose a Spin-Torque (ST) based sensing scheme that can
enable energy efficient multi-bit long distance interconnect architectures.
Current-mode interconnects have recently been proposed to overcome the
performance degradations associated with conventional voltage mode Copper (Cu)
interconnects. However, the performance of current mode interconnects are
limited by analog current sensing transceivers and equalization circuits. As a
solution, we propose the use of ST based receivers that use Magnetic Tunnel
Junctions (MTJ) and simple digital components for current-to-voltage conversion
and do not require analog transceivers. We incorporate Spin-Hall Metal (SHM) in
our design to achieve high speed sensing. We show both single and multi-bit
operations that reveal major benefits at higher speeds. Our simulation results
show that the proposed technique consumes only 3.93-4.72 fJ/bit/mm energy while
operating at 1-2 Gbits/sec; which is considerably better than existing charge
based interconnects. In addition, Voltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA)
can reduce the required current at the sensor. With the inclusion of VCMA, the
energy consumption can be further reduced to 2.02-4.02 fJ/bit/mm"
"Safe evacuation of people from building and outdoor environments, and search
and rescue operations, always will remain actual in course of all
socio-technological developments. Modern facilities offer a range of automated
systems to guide residents towards emergency exists. The systems are assumed to
be infallible. But what if they fail? How occupants not familiar with a
building layout will be looking for exits in case of very limited visibility
where tactile sensing is the only way to assess the environment? Analogous
models of human behaviour, and socio-dynamics in general, are provided to be
fruitful ways to explore alternative, or would-be scenarios. Crowd, or a single
person, dynamics could be imitated using particle systems, reaction-diffusion
chemical medium, electro-magnetic fields, or social insects. Each type of
analogous model offer unique insights on behavioural patterns of natural
systems in constrained geometries. In this particular paper we have chosen
leeches to analyse patterns of exploration. Reasons are two-fold. First, when
deprived from other stimuli leeches change their behavioural modes in an
automated regime in response to mechanical stimulation. Therefore leeches can
give us invaluable information on how human beings might behave under stress
and limited visibility. Second, leeches are ideal blueprints of future
soft-bodied rescue robots. Leeches have modular nervous circuitry with a rich
behavioral spectrum. Leeches are multi-functional, fault-tolerant with
autonomous inter-segment coordination and adaptive decision-making. We aim to
answer the question: how efficiently a real building can be explored and
whether there any dependencies on the pathways of exploration and geometrical
complexity of the building. In our case studies we use templates made on the
floor plan of real building."
"Leeches are fascinating creatures: they have simple modular nervous circuitry
m yet exhibit a rich spectrum of behavioural modes. Leeches could be ideal
blue-prints for designing flexible soft robots which are modular,
multi-functional, fault-tolerant, easy to control, capable for navigating using
optical, mechanical and chemical sensorial inputs, have autonomous
inter-segmental coordination and adaptive decision-making. With future designs
of leech-robots in mind we study how leeches behave in geometrically
constrained spaces. Core results of the paper deal with leeches exploring a row
of rooms arranged along a narrow corridor. In laboratory experiments we find
that rooms closer to ends of the corridor are explored by leeches more often
than rooms in the middle of the corridor. Also, in series of scoping
experiments, we evaluate leeches capabilities to navigating in mazes towards
sources of vibration and chemo-attraction. We believe our results lay
foundation for future developments of robots mimicking behaviour of leeches."
"The manipulation of biological substrates is becoming more popular route
towards generating novel computing devices. Physarum polycephalum is used as a
model organism in biocomputing because it can create `wires' for use in hybrid
circuits; programmable growth by manipulation through external stimuli and the
ability withstanding a current and its tolerance to hybridisation with a
variety of nano/microparticles. Lettuce seedlings have also had previous
interest invested in them for generating plant wires, although currently there
is little information as to their suitability for such applications. In this
study both P. polycephalum and Lettuce seedlings were hybridised with gold
nanoparticles - functionalised and unfunctionalised - to explore their uptake,
toxicological effects and, crucially, any alterations in electrical properties
they bestow upon the organisms. Using various microscopy techniques it was
shown that P. polycephalum and lettuce seedlings are able to internalize
nanoparticles and assemble them in vivo, however some toxicological effects
were observed. The electrical resistance of both lettuce seedlings and P.
polycephalum was found to decrease, the most significant reduction being with
lettuce seedlings whose resistance reduced from 3MOhms to 0.5MOhms. We conclude
that gold is a suitable nanomaterial for biohybridisation specifically in
creating conductive pathways for more efficient biological wires in
self-growing hybrid circuitry."
"Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye.
Let the slime mould span two electrodes with a single protoplasmic tube: if the
tube is heated to approximately 40{\deg}C, the electrical resistance of the
protoplasmic tube increases from 3 M{\Omega} to approximatively 10'000
M{\Omega}. The organism's resistance is not proportional nor correlated to the
temperature of its environment. Slime mould can therefore not be considered as
a thermistor but rather as a thermic switch. We employ the P. polycephalum
thermic switch to prototype hybrid electrical analog summator, NAND gates, and
cascade the gates into Flip-Flop latch. Computing operations performed on this
bio-hybrid computing circuitry feature high repeatability, reproducibility and
comparably low propagation delays"
"Advances in CMOS-compatible photonic elements have made it plausible to
exploit nanophotonic communications to overcome the limitations of traditional
NoCs. Amongst various proposed nanophotonic architectures, optical crossbars
have been shown to provide high performance in terms of bandwidth and latency.
In general, optical crossbars provide a vast volume of network resources that
are shared among all the cores within the chip. In this paper, we present a
fair and efficient admission control mechanism for shared wavelengths and
buffer space in optical crossbars. We model buffer management and wavelength
assignment as a utility-based convex optimization problem, whose solution
determines the admission control policy. Thanks to efficient convex
optimization techniques, we obtain the globally optimal solution of the
admission control optimization problem by using simple and yet efficient
iterative algorithms. We cast our solution procedure as an iterative algorithm
to be implemented a central admission controller. Our experimental results
corroborate the gain that can be obtained by using such an admission controller
to manage the shared resources of the system. Furthermore, they confirm that
the proposed admission control algorithm works well for various traffic
patterns and parameters, and evinces a tractable scalability with increase in
the number of cores of the crossbar."
"In this paper, we consider the diffusive molecular communication channel
between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a fluid
environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter nano-machine
into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order degradation
reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can participate in a
reversible bimolecular-reaction with receiver receptor proteins. We derive a
closed-form analytical expression for the expected received signal at the
receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated receptors on the surface of
the receiver. The accuracy of the derived analytical result is verified with a
Brownian motion particle-based simulation of the environment."
"Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) is an emerging technology considered as one of
the key solutions for future generation on-chip interconnects. However, silicon
photonic devices in ONoC are highly sensitive to temperature variation, which
leads to a lower efficiency of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers
(VCSELs), a resonant wavelength shift of Microring Resonators (MR), and results
in a lower Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a methodology
enabling thermal-aware design for optical interconnects relying on
CMOS-compatible VCSEL. Thermal simulations allow designing ONoC interfaces with
low gradient temperature and analytical models allow evaluating the SNR."
"The many cores design research community have shown high interest in optical
crossbars on chip for more than a decade. Key properties of optical crossbars,
namely a) contention free data routing b) low latency communication and c)
potential for high bandwidth through the use of WDM, motivate several
implementations of this type of interconnect. These implementations demonstrate
very different scalability and power efficiency ability depending on three key
design factors: a) the network topology, b) the considered layout and the c)
the injection losses induced by the fabrication process. In this paper, the
worst-case optical losses of crossbar implementations are compared according to
the factors mentioned above. The comparison results has the potential to help
many cores system designer to select the most appropriate crossbar
implementation according, for instance, to the number of IP cores and the chip
die size."

indicate that the proposed ring-based network exhibits, on average, 22% and
51.4% improvement for worst-case and average losses respectively compared to
the most power-efficient related crossbars."
"Slime mould \emph{Physarum polycephalum} is a large single cell capable for
distributed sensing, concurrent information processing, parallel computation
and decentralised actuation. The ease of culturing and experimenting with
Physarum makes this slime mould an ideal substrate for real-world
implementations of unconventional sensing and computing devices. In the last
decade the Physarum became a swiss knife of the unconventional computing: give
the slime mould a problem it will solve it. We provide a concise summary of
what exact computing and sensing operations are implemented with live slime
mould. The Physarum devices range from morphological processors for
computational geometry to experimental archeology tools, from self-routing
wires to memristors, from devices approximating a shortest path to analog
physical models of space exploration."
"We present new algorithms to synthesize exact universal reversible gate
library for various types of gates and costs. We use the powerful algebraic
software GAP for implementation and examination of our algorithms and the
reversible logic synthesis problems have been reduced to group theory problems.
It is shown that minimization of arbitrary cost functions of gates and orders
of magnitude are faster than its previously counterparts for reversible logic
synthesis. Experimental results show that a significant improvement over the
previously proposed synthesis algorithm is obtained compared with the existing
approaches to reversible logic synthesis."
"We discuss the memristive fingerprints of the hybrid Cassie-Mayr model of
electric arcs. In particular, it is shown that (i) the voltage-current
characteristic of the model has the pinched hysteresis nature, (ii) the voltage
and current zero crossings occur at the same instants, and, (iii) when the
frequency $f$ of the power supply increases, the voltage-current pinched
hysteresis characteristic tends closer to a single-valued one, meaning that the
voltage-current graph becomes that of a resistor (with an increased linearity
for $f\rightarrow \infty$). The conductance $g$ of the Cassie-Mayr model
decreases when the frequency increases. The hybrid Cassie-Mayr model describes
therefore an interesting case of a memristive phenomenon."
"We overview experimental laboratory prototypes of maze solvers. We speculate
that all maze solvers implement Lee algorithm by first developing a gradient of
values showing a distance from any site of the maze to the destination site and
then tracing a path from a given source site to the destination site. All
prototypes approximate a set of many-source-one-destination paths using
resistance, chemical and temporal gradients. They trace a path from a given
source site to the destination site using electrical current, fluidic, growth
of slime mould, Marangoni flow, crawling of epithelial cells, excitation waves
in chemical medium, propagating crystallisation patterns. Some of the
prototypes visualise the path using a stream of dye, thermal camera or glow
discharge; others require a computer to extract the path from time lapse images
of the tracing. We discuss the prototypes in terms of speed, costs and
durability of the path visualisation."
"Emerging technologies present opportunities for system designers to meet the
challenges presented by competing trends of big data analytics and limitations
on CMOS scaling. Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density
technology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform
computation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior
(storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that
can embed computation with storage.
  This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances
of the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of
memristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based
content addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over
large datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes
a concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data
structures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS
processor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable
memristor technologies for lower levels.
  We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and
use analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data
structures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our
configurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive
applications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.
Furthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data
structures provide opportunities to tune the trade- off between performance and
lifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or
other technologies with improved endurance."
"Reversible computation is gaining increasing relevance in the context of
several post-CMOS technologies, the most prominent of those being Quantum
computing. One of the key theoretical problem pertaining to reversible logic
synthesis is the upper bound of the gate count. Compared to the known bounds,
the results obtained by optimal synthesis methods are significantly less. In
this paper, we connect this problem with the multiplicative complexity analysis
of classical Boolean functions. We explore the possibility of relaxing the
ancilla and if that approach makes the upper bound tighter. Our results are
negative. The ancilla-free synthesis methods by using transformations and by
starting from an Exclusive Sum-of-Product (ESOP) formulation remain,
theoretically, the synthesis methods for achieving least gate count for the
cases where the number of variables $n$ is $< 8$ and otherwise, respectively."
"A fluidic one-bit half-adder is made of five channels which intersect at a
junction. Two channels are inputs, two channels are outputs and one channel is
the drain. The channels direct fluid from input fragments to output fragments
and the streams of fluid interact at the junctions. Binary signals are
represented by water droplets introduced in the input channels: presence of a
droplet in an input or output segments symbolises logical {\sc True}, absence
--- {\sc False}. The droplets travel along channels by following a path of
least resistance unless deflected at the junction. We demonstrate the function
of the half-adder in both computer modelling and laboratory experiments, and
propose a design of a one-bit full adder based on simulation."
"In this paper, we report the effect of write voltage and frequency on
memristor based Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM). The above said
parameters have been investigated on the linear drift model of memristor. With
a variation of write voltage from 0.2V to 1.2V and a subsequent frequency
modulation from 1, 2, 4, 10, 100 and 200 Hz the corresponding effects on memory
window, Low Resistance State (LRS) and High Resistance State (HRS) have been
reported. Thus the lifetime ({\tau}) reliability analysis of memristor based
RRAM is carried out using above results. It is found that, the HRS is
independent of write voltage, whereas LRS shows dependency on write voltage and
frequency. The simulation results showcase that the memristor possess higher
memory window and lifetime ({\tau}) in the higher voltage with lower frequency
region, which has been attributed to the fewer data losses in the memory
architecture."
"Processing in Memory (PIM) is a computing paradigm that promises enormous
gain in processing speed by eradicating latencies in the typical von Neumann
architecture. It has gained popularity owing to its throughput by embedding
storage and computation of data in a single unit. We portray implementation of
Akers array architecture endowed with PIM computation using Quantum-dot
Cellular Automata (QCA). We present the proof of concept of PIM with its
realization in the QCA designer paradigm. We illustrate implementation of Ex-OR
gate with the help of QCA based Akers Array and put forth many interesting
potential possibilities."
"We prove that statistical information theoretic quantities, such as
information entropy, cannot generally be interrelated with the lower limit of
energy dissipation during information erasure. We also point out that, in
deterministic and error-free computers, the information entropy of memories
does not change during erasure because its value is always zero. On the other
hand, for information-theoretic erasure - i.e., ""thermalization"" /
randomization of the memory - the originally zero information entropy (with
deterministic data in the memory) changes after erasure to its maximum value, 1
bit / memory bit, while the energy dissipation is still positive, even at
parameters for which the thermodynamic entropy within the memory cell does not
change. Information entropy does not convert to thermodynamic entropy and to
the related energy dissipation; they are quantities of different physical
nature. Possible specific observations (if any) indicating convertibility are
at most fortuitous and due to the disregard of additional processes that are
present."
"It is observed that the inductive and capacitive features of the memristor
reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very
presence of the voltage and current state variables, associated by their
electrodynamics sense with electrical and magnetic fields, in the resistive
characteristic v = f(i), forces any resister to accumulate some magnetic and
electrostatic fields and energies around itself, i.e. L and C elements are
always present. From the circuit-theoretic point of view, the role of the
memristor is seen, first of all, in the elimination of the use of a unique
v(i). This makes circuits with hysteresis characteristics relevant, and also
suggests that the concept of memristor should influence the basic problem of
definition of nonlinearity. Since the memristor mainly originates from the
resistor, it was found necessary to overview some unusual cases of resistive
circuits. The present opinion is that the framework of basic circuit theory and
its connection with applications should be logically expanded in order to
naturally include the new element."
"In this paper, we investigate few memristor-based analog circuits namely the
phase shift oscillator, integrator, and differentiator which have been explored
numerously using the traditional lumped components. We use LTspice-IV platform
for simulation of the above-said circuits. The investigation resorts to the
nonlinear dopant drift model of memristor and the window function portrayed in
the literature for nonlinearity realization. The results of our investigations
depict good agreement with the conventional lumped component based phase shift
oscillator, integrator, and differentiator circuits. The results are evident to
showcase the potential of the memristor as a promising candidate for the next
generation analog circuits."
"Active Learning Method (ALM) is one of the powerful tools in soft computing
that is inspired by human brain capabilities in processing complicated
information. ALM, which is in essence an adaptive fuzzy learning method, models
a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system with several Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) subsystems. Ink Drop Spread (IDS) operator, which is the
main processing engine of this method, extracts useful features from the data
without complicated computations and provides stability and convergence as
well. Despite great performance of ALM in applications such as classification,
clustering, and modelling, an efficient hardware implementation has remained a
challenging problem. Large amount of memory required to store the information
of IDS planes as well as the high computational cost of the IDS computing
system are two main barriers to ALM becoming more popular. In this paper, a
novel learning method is proposed based on the idea of IDS, but with a novel
approach that eliminates the computational cost of IDS operator. Unlike
traditional approaches, our proposed method finds functions to describe the IDS
plane that eliminates the need for large amount of memory to a great extent.
Narrow Path and Spread, which are two main features used in the inference
engine of ALM, are then extracted from IDS planes with minimum amount of memory
usage and power consumption. Our proposed algorithm is fully compatible with
memristor-crossbar implementation that leads to a significant decrease in the
number of required memristors (from O(n^2) to O(3n)). Simpler algorithm and
higher speed make our algorithm suitable for applications where real-time
process, low-cost and small implementation are paramount. Applications in
clustering and function approximation are provided, which reveals the effective
performance of our proposed algorithm."
"With many advantageous features, softness and better biocompatibility,
flexible electronic devices have developed rapidly and increasingly attracted
attention. Many currently applications with flexible devices are sensors and
drivers, while there is nearly no utilization aiming at complex computation
since flexible devices have lower electron mobility, simple structure and large
process variation. In this paper, we proposed an innovative method that enabled
flexible devices to implement real-time and energy-efficient
Difference-of-Gaussian, which illustrated feasibility and potentials for them
to achieve complicated real-time computation in future generation products."
"Molecular Communication as the most potential methods to solve the
communication in nano scale, for it's derived from nature, and it becomes more
and more prevalent. Though molecular communication happens in three dimensional
situation, there are also some situation that are in the one dimensional
situation, especially when considering the transmitters and the receivers are
in extremely short distance or in long slim pipe. In this paper, we introduce
the one dimensional situation, and studied how the continuous information
molecules transmitted in this situation, also introduced how to encode and
decode the information molecules, and based on the molecular communication
model, we studied some metrics of it, such as the distance between transmitter
and receiver, the emitting frequency of transmitter. Through the research we
know that the distance and frequency are important metrics to the successful
communication, which can direct us how to place the nano transmitters and
receivers in the future nano network environment."
"The study of Molecular Communication(MC) is more and more prevalence, and
channel model of MC plays an important role in the MC System. Since different
propagation environment and modulation techniques produce different channel
model, most of the research about MC are in horizontal direction,but in nature
the communications between nano machines are in short range and some of the
information transportation are in the vertical direction, such as transpiration
of plants, biological pump in ocean, and blood transportation from heart to
brain. Therefore, this paper we propose a vertical channel model which
nano-machines communicate with each other in the vertical direction based on
pure diffusion. We first propose a vertical molecular communication model, we
mainly considered the gravity as the factor, though the channel model is also
affected by other main factors, such as the flow of the medium, the distance
between the transmitter and the receiver, the delay or sensitivity of the
transmitter and the receiver. Secondly, we set up a test-bed for this vertical
channel model, in order to verify the difference between the theory result and
the experiment data. At last, we use the data we get from the experiment and
the non-linear least squares method to get the parameters to make our channel
model more accurate."
"In diffusion-based molecular communication, information transport is governed
by diffusion through a fluid medium. The achievable data rates for these
channels are very low compared to the radio-based communication system, since
diffusion can be a slow process. To improve the data rate, a novel
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) design for molecular communication is
proposed that utilizes multiple molecular emitters at the transmitter and
multiple molecular detectors at the receiver (in RF communication these all
correspond to antennas). Using particle-based simulators, the channel's impulse
response is obtained and mathematically modeled. These models are then used to
determine inter-link interference (ILI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). It
is assumed that when the receiver has incomplete information regarding the
system and the channel state, low complexity symbol detection methods are
preferred since the receiver is small and simple. Thus four detection
algorithms are proposed---adaptive thresholding, practical zero forcing with
channel models excluding/including the ILI and ISI, and Genie-aided zero
forcing. The proposed algorithms are evaluated extensively using numerical and
analytical evaluations."
"It is well known that timing jitter can degrade the bit error rate (BER) of
receivers that recover clock information from the input data. However, timing
jitter can also result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock
recovery circuits at the receivers, particularly in low swing mesochronous
systems. Mesochronous clock retiming circuits are required in repeaterless low
swing on-chip interconnects in order to sample the low swing data at the center
of the eye. This paper discusses the settling time of these circuits. First, a
discussion on how timing jitter can result in large increase in the settling
time of the clock recovery circuit is presented. Next, the circuit is modeled
as a Markov chain with absorbing states. Here, the mean time of absorption of
the Markov chain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is
determined. The model is validated by using behavioural simulations of the
circuit, the results of which match well with the model predictions. The
modelling is applied to study the effect of different types of jitter, like
data dependent jitter of 1 bit and 2 bits, random jitter and random jitter
along with 1 bit data dependent jitter. Finally, a few techniques of reducing
the settling time are presented and their efficacy is confirmed with circuit
simulations."
"FinFET technology is prone to suffer from Line Edge Roughness (LER) based VT
variation with scaling. To address this, we proposed an Epitaxially Defined
(ED) FinFET (EDFinFET) as an alternate to FinFET architecture for 10 nm node
and beyond. We showed by statistical simulations that EDFinFET reduces LER
based VT variability by 90% and overall variability by 59%. However, EDFinFET
consists of wider fins as the fin widths are not constrained by electrostatics
and variability (cf. FinFETs have fin width ~ LG/3 where LG is gate-length).
This indicates that EDFinFET based circuits may be less dense. In this study we
show that wide fins enable taller fin heights. The ability to engineer multiple
STI levels on tall fins enables different transistor widths (i.e. various W/Ls
e.g. 1-10) in a single fin. This capability ensures that even though individual
EDFinFET devices have ~2x larger footprints than FinFETs, EDFinFET may produce
equal or higher circuit density for basic building blocks like inverters or
NAND gates for W/Ls of 2 and higher."
"Due to the massive parallel computing capability and outstanding image and
signal processing performance, cellular neural network (CNN) is one promising
type of non-Boolean computing system that can outperform the traditional
digital logic computation and mitigate the physical scaling limit of the
conventional CMOS technology. The CNN was originally implemented by VLSI analog
technologies with operational amplifiers and operational transconductance
amplifiers as neurons and synapses, respectively, which are power and area
consuming. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structure to implement the CNN
with magnetic components and CMOS peripherals with a complete driving and
sensing circuitry. In addition, we propose a digitally programmable magnetic
synapse that can achieve both positive and negative values of the templates.
After rigorous performance analyses and comparisons, optimal energy is achieved
based on various design parameters, including the driving voltage and the CMOS
driving size. At a comparable footprint area and operation speed, a spintronic
CNN is projected to achieve more than one order of magnitude energy reduction
per operation compared to its CMOS counterpart."
"In molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD), the inter-symbol
interference (ISI) is a well known severe problem that deteriorates both data
rates and link reliability. ISI mainly occurs due to the slow and highly random
propagation of the messenger molecules, which causes the emitted molecules from
the previous symbols to interfere with molecules from the current symbol. An
effective way to mitigate the ISI is using enzymes to degrade undesired
molecules. Prior work on ISI mitigation by enzymes has assumed an infinite
amount of enzymes randomly distributed around the molecular channel. Taking a
different approach, this paper assumes an MCvD channel with a limited amount of
enzymes. The main question this paper addresses is how to deploy these enzymes
in an effective structure so that ISI mitigation is maximized. To find an
effective MCvD channel environment, this study considers optimization of the
shape of the transmitter node, the deployment location and structure, the size
of the enzyme deployed area, and the half-lives of the enzymes. It also
analyzes the dependence of the optimum size of the enzyme area on the distance
and half-life."
"In this paper, we review the different memristive threshold logic (MTL)
circuits that are inspired from the synaptic action of flow of
neurotransmitters in the biological brain. Brain like generalisation ability
and area minimisation of these threshold logic circuits aim towards crossing
the Moores law boundaries at device, circuits and systems levels.Fast switching
memory, signal processing, control systems, programmable logic, image
processing, reconfigurable computing, and pattern recognition are identified as
some of the potential applications of MTL systems. The physical realization of
nanoscale devices with memristive behaviour from materials like TiO2,
ferroelectrics, silicon, and polymers has accelerated research effort in these
application areas inspiring the scientific community to pursue design of high
speed, low cost, low power and high density neuromorphic architectures."
"Optical computing has emerged as a promising candidate for real-time and
parallel continuous data processing. Motivated by recent progresses in
metamaterial-based analog computing [Science 343, 160 (2014)], we theoretically
investigate realization of two-dimensional complex mathematical operations
using rotated configurations, recently reported in [Opt. Lett. 39, 1278
(2014)]. Breaking the reflection symmetry, such configurations could realize
both even and odd Green's functions associated with spatial operators. Based on
such appealing theory and by using Brewster effect, we demonstrate realization
of a first-order differentiator. Such efficient wave-based computation method
not only circumvents the major potential drawbacks of metamaterials, but also
offers the most compact possible device compared to the conventional bulky
lens-based optical signal and data processors."
"Quantum-dot fabrication and characterization is a well-established
technology, which is used in photonics, quantum optics and nanoelectronics.
Four quantum-dots placed at the corners of a square form a unit cell, which can
hold a bit of information and serve as a basis for Quantum-dot Cellular
Automata (QCA) nanoelectronic circuits. Although several basic QCA circuits
have been designed, fabricated and tested, proving that quantum-dots can form
functional, fast and low-power nanoelectornic circuits, QCA nanoelectronics
still remain at its infancy. One of the reasons for this is the lack of design
automation tools, which will facilitate the systematic design of large QCA
circuits that contemporary applications demand. Here we present novel,
programmable QCA circuits, which are based on crossbar architecture. These
circuits can be programmed to implement any Boolean function in analogy to CMOS
FPGAs and open the road that will lead to full design automation of QCA
nanoelectronic circuits. Using this architecture we designed and simulated QCA
circuits that proved to be area efficient, stable and reliable."
"Parallel and monolithic 3D integration directions offer pathways to realize
3D integrated circuits (ICs) but still lead to layer-by-layer implementations,
each functional layer being composed in 2D first. This mindset causes
challenging connectivity, routing and layer alignment between layers when
connected in 3D, with a routing access that can be even worse than 2D CMOS,
which fundamentally limits their potential. To fully exploit the opportunities
in the third dimension, we propose Skybridge-3D-CMOS (S3DC), a fine-grained 3D
integration approach that is directly composed in 3D, utilizing the vertical
dimension vs. using a layer-by-layer assembly mindset. S3DC uses a novel wafer
fabric creation with direct 3D design and connectivity in the vertical
dimension. It builds on a uniform vertical nanowire template that is processed
as a single wafer; it incorporates specifically architected structures for
realizing devices, circuits, and heat management directly in 3D. Novel 3D
interconnect concepts, including within the silicon layers, enable
significantly improved routing flexibility in all three dimensions and a
high-density 3D design paradigm overall. Intrinsic components for fabric-level
3D heat management are introduced. Extensive bottom-up simulations and
experiments have been presented to validate the key fabric-enabling concepts.
Evaluation results indicate up to 40x density and 10x performance-per-watt
benefits against conventional 16-nm CMOS for the circuits studied; benefits are
also at least an order of magnitude beyond what was shown to be possible with
other 3D directions."
"Conventional 2D CMOS technology is reaching fundamental scaling limits, and
interconnect bottleneck is dominating integrated circuit (IC) power and
performance. While 3D IC technologies using Through Silicon Via or Monolithic
Inter-layer Via alleviate some of these challenges, they follow a similar
layout and routing mindset as 2D CMOS. This is insufficient to address routing
requirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion
at large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a
recently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that
presents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D
connectivity and manufacturability challenges. Skybridge's core fabric
components enable a new 3D IC design approach with vertically-composed logic
gates, and provide a greater degree of routing flexibility compared to
conventional 2D and 3D ICs leading to much larger benefits and future
scalability. In this paper, we present a methodology using relevant metrics to
evaluate and quantify the benefits of Skybridge vs. state-of-the-art
transistor-level monolithic 3D IC (T-MI) and 2D in terms of routability and its
impact on large-scale circuits. This is enabled by a new device-to-system
design flow with commercial CAD tools that we developed for large-scale
Skybridge IC designs in 16nm node. Evaluation for standard benchmark circuits
shows that Skybridge yields up to 1.6x lower routing demand against T-MI with
no routing congestion (routing demand to resource ratio < 1) at all metal
layers. This 3D routability in conjunction with compact vertical gate design in
Skybridge translate into benefits of up to 3x lower power and 11x higher
density over 2D CMOS, while TLM-3DIC approach only has up to 22% power saving
and 2x density improvement over 2D CMOS."
"Deep Spiking Neural Networks are becoming increasingly powerful tools for
cognitive computing platforms. However, most of the existing literature on such
computing models are developed with limited insights on the underlying hardware
implementation, resulting in area and power expensive designs. Although several
neuromimetic devices emulating neural operations have been proposed recently,
their functionality has been limited to very simple neural models that may
prove to be inefficient at complex recognition tasks. In this work, we venture
into the relatively unexplored area of utilizing the inherent device
stochasticity of such neuromimetic devices to model complex neural
functionalities in a probabilistic framework in the time domain. We consider
the implementation of a Deep Spiking Neural Network capable of performing high
accuracy and low latency classification tasks where the neural computing unit
is enabled by the stochastic switching behavior of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction.
Simulation studies indicate an energy improvement of $20\times$ over a baseline
CMOS design in $45nm$ technology."
"Memristor (memory-resistor) is the fourth passive circuit element. We
introduce a memristor model based on a fuzzy logic window function. Fuzzy
models are flexible, which enables the capture of the pinched hysteresis
behavior of the memristor. The introduced fuzzy model avoids common problems
associated with window-function based memristor models, such as the terminal
state problem, and the symmetry issues. The model captures the memristor
behavior with a simple rule-base which gives an insight of how memristors work.
Because of the flexibility offered by the fuzzy system, shape and distribution
of input and output membership functions can be tuned to capture the behavior
of various real memristors."
"Reversible logic synthesis is emerging as a major research component for
post-CMOS computing devices, in particular Quantum computing. In this work, we
link the reversible logic synthesis problem to sorting algorithms. Based on our
analysis, an alternative derivation of the worst-case complexity of generated
reversible circuits is provided. Furthermore, a novel column-wise reversible
logic synthesis method, termed RevCol, is designed with inspiration from radix
sort. Extending the principles of RevCol, we present a hybrid reversible logic
synthesis framework. The theoretical and experimental results are presented.
The results are extensively benchmarked with state-of-the-art ancilla-free
reversible logic synthesis methods."
"New technologies such as Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA), Single Electron
Tunneling (SET), Tunneling Phase Logic (TPL) and all-spin logic (ASL) devices
have been widely advocated in nanotechnology as a response to the physical
limits associated with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
technology in atomic scales. Some of their peculiar features are their smaller
size, higher speed, higher switching frequency, lower power consumption, and
higher scale integration. In these technologies, the majority (or minority) and
inverter gates are employed for the production of the functions as this set of
gates makes a universal set of Boolean primitives in these technologies. An
important step in the generation of Boolean functions using the majority gate
is reducing the number of involved gates. In this paper, a multi-objective
synthesis methodology (with the objective priority of gate counts, gate levels
and the number of inverter gates) is presented for finding the minimal number
of possible majority gates in the synthesis of Boolean functions using the
proposed Majority Specification Matrix (MSM) concept. Moreover, based on MSM, a
synthesis flow is proposed for the synthesis of multi-output Boolean functions.
To reveal the efficiency of the proposed method, it is compared with a
meta-heuristic method, multi-objective Genetic Programing (GP). Besides, it is
applied to synthesize MCNC benchmark circuits. The results are indicative of
the outperformance of the proposed method in comparison to multi-objective GP
method. Also, for the MCNC benchmark circuits, there is an average reduction of
10.5% in the number of levels as well as 16.8% and 33.5% in the number of
majority and inverter gates, as compared to the best available method
respectively."
"Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is an emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
technology that provides better endurance, write energy and performance than
traditional NVM technologies such as Flash. In embedded application such as
microcontroller SoC of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded Flash (eFlash) is
widely employed. However, eFlash is also associated with cost. Therefore,
replacing eFlash with STTRAM is desirable in IoTs for power-efficiency.
Although promising, STTRAM brings several new security and privacy challenges
that pose a significant threat to sensitive data in memory. This is inevitable
due to the underlying dependency of this memory technology on environmental
parameters such as temperature and magnetic fields that can be exploited by an
adversary to tamper with the program and data. In this paper, we investigate
these attacks and propose a novel memory architecture for attack resilient IoT
network. The information redundancy present in a homogeneous peer-to-peer
connected IoT network is exploited to restore the corrupted memory of any IoT
node when under attack. We are able to build a failsafe IoT system with STTRAM
based program memory which allows guaranteed execution of all the IoT nodes
without complete shutdown of any node under attack. Experimental results using
commercial IoT boards demonstrate the latency and energy overhead of the attack
recovery process."
"Crossbar arrays using emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as
Resistive RAM (ReRAM) offer high density, fast access speed and low-power.
However the bandwidth of the crossbar is limited to single-bit read/write per
access to avoid selection of undesirable bits. We propose a technique to
perform multi-bit read and write in a diode-STTRAM (Spin Transfer Torque RAM)
crossbar array. Simulation shows that the biasing voltage of half-selected
cells can be adjusted to improve the sense margin during read and thus reduce
the sneak path through the half-selected cells. In write operation, the
half-selected cells are biased with a pulse voltage source which increases the
write latency of these cells and enables to write 2-bits while keeping the
half-selected bits undisturbed. Simulation results indicate biasing the
half-selected cells by 700mV can enable reading as much as 512-bits while
sustaining 512x512 crossbar with 2.04 years retention. The 2-bit writing
requires pulsing by 50mV to optimize energy."
"In this paper, we present high-level overviews of tile-based self-assembling
systems capable of producing complex, infinite, aperiodic structures known as
discrete self-similar fractals. Fractals have a variety of interesting
mathematical and structural properties, and by utilizing the bottom-up growth
paradigm of self-assembly to create them we not only learn important techniques
for building such complex structures, we also gain insight into how similar
structural complexity arises in natural self-assembling systems. Our results
fundamentally leverage hierarchical assembly processes, and use as our building
blocks square ""tile"" components which are capable of activating and
deactivating their binding ""glues"" a constant number of times each, based only
on local interactions. We provide the first constructions capable of building
arbitrary discrete self-similar fractals at scale factor 1, and many at
temperature 1 (i.e. ""non-cooperatively""), including the Sierpinski triangle."
"Imagine coating buildings and bridges with smart particles (also coined smart
paint) that monitor structural integrity and sense and report on traffic and
wind loads, leading to technology that could do such inspection jobs faster and
cheaper and increase safety at the same time. In this paper, we study the
problem of uniformly coating objects of arbitrary shape in the context of
self-organizing programmable matter, i.e., the programmable matter consists of
simple computational elements called particles that can establish and release
bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way. Particles are anonymous,
have constant-size memory and utilize only local interactions in order to coat
an object. We continue the study of our Universal Coating algorithm by focusing
on its runtime analysis, showing that our algorithm terminates within a linear
number of rounds with high probability. We also present a matching linear lower
bound that holds with high probability. We use this lower bound to show a
linear lower bound on the competitive gap between fully local coating
algorithms and coating algorithms that rely on global information, which
implies that our algorithm is also optimal in a competitive sense. Simulation
results show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm may be better than
linear in practice."
"Recent advancements in the development of memristive devices has opened new
opportunities for hardware implementation of non-Boolean computing. To this
end, the suitability of memristive devices for swarm intelligence algorithms
has enabled researchers to solve a maze in hardware. In this paper, we utilize
swarm intelligence of memristive networks to perform image edge detection.
First, we propose a hardware-friendly algorithm for image edge detection based
on ant colony. Second, we implement the image edge detection algorithm using
memristive networks. Furthermore, we explain the impact of various parameters
of the memristors on the efficacy of the implementation. Our results show 28%
improvement in the energy compared to a low power CMOS hardware implementation
based on stochastic circuits. Furthermore, our design occupies up to 5x less
area."
"Transistor random mismatch continuously poses challenges for analog/RF
circuit design for achieving high accuracy and high yield as the process
technology advances. Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method
can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general
calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation,
we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended
statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES
method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher
calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES
based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is
current source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify
this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we
designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.
The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving
harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the
ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection
ratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a
current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based
amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance.
Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude
linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC."
"The Majority (or Density Classification) Problem in Cellular Automata (CA)
aims to converge a string of cells to a final homogeneous state which reflects
the majority of states present in the initial configuration. The problem is
challenging in CA as individual cells only possess information about their own
and local neighbour states. The problem is an exercise in the propagation and
processing of information within a distributed computational medium. We explore
whether the Majority Problem can be approximated in a similarly simple
distributed computing substrate - a multi-agent model of slime mould. An
initial pattern of discrete voting choices is represented by spatial
arrangement of the agent population, temporarily held in-place by an attractant
stimulus. When this stimulus is removed the model adapts its shape and size,
moving to form a minimal distance connecting line. The final position of this
line is shown, in simple examples, to successfully represent the majority vote
decision, and also accurately reflects the size of the majority. We note
properties, limitations and potential improvements to the approach before
returning full-circle by re-encoding this morphological adaptation approach in
a simple (and more space efficient) 1D CA model."
"Stochastic behaviors of resistive random access memory (RRAM) play an
important role in the design of cross-point memory arrays. A Monte Carlo
compact model of oxide RRAM is developed and calibrated with experiments on
various device stack configurations. With Monte Carlo SPICE simulations, we
show that an increase in array size and interconnect wire resistance will
statistically deteriorate write functionality. Write failure probability (WFP)
has an exponential dependency on device uniformity and supply voltage (VDD),
and the array bias scheme is a key knob. Lowering array VDD leads to higher
effective energy consumption (EEC) due to the increase in WFP when the
variation statistics are included in the analysis. Finally, we show that a
pseudo-sub-array topology with uniformly distributed pre-forming cells in the
pristine high resistance state is able to reduce both WFP and EEC, enabling
higher net capacity for memory circuits due to improved variation tolerance."
"Transiently Powered Computers (TPCs) are novel devices that are battery-less
and operate using only ambient energy. Therefore TPCs are prone to frequent
power interruptions, and such the need for developing TPC-centric algorithms is
a necessity. We advocate that only through a common experimental environment,
accessible to everyone, a proper comparison of newly developed algorithms for
TPCs can be realized. Moreover, only through access to various TPC
testbeds---distributed geographically throughout the world---a proper
applications testing and validation are possible. We enlist properties and
features that any TPC testbed should have, calling for more coordinated action
in this domain of TPC research. Finally, we present (to the best of our
knowledge) world's first Internet-accessible testbed for TPCs."
"Solid-state memory is an essential component of the digital age. With
advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the
demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review,
we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the
fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of
replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a
fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and
nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory
arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing
information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of
transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this
review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their
functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are
critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer
electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are
benchmarked and future prospects are provided."
"In a recent article, Nature Communications 7 (2016) 12068, the authors
claimed that they demonstrated sub-kBT energy dissipation at elementary logic
operations. However, the argumentation is invalid because it neglects the
dominant source of energy dissipation, namely, the charging energy of the
capacitance of the input electrode, which totally dissipates during the full
(0-1-0) cycle of logic values. The neglected dissipation phenomenon is
identical with the mechanism that leads to the lower physical limit of
dissipation (70-100 kBT) in today's microprocessors (CMOS logic) and in any
other system with thermally activated errors thus the same limit holds for the
new scheme, too."
"Coupled oscillator-based networks are an attractive approach for implementing
hardware neural networks based on emerging nanotechnologies. However, the
readout of the state of a coupled oscillator network is a difficult challenge
in hardware implementations, as it necessitates complex signal processing to
evaluate the degree of synchronization between oscillators, possibly more
complicated than the coupled oscillator network itself. In this work, we focus
on a coupled oscillator network particularly adapted to emerging technologies,
and evaluate two schemes for reading synchronization patterns that can be
readily implemented with basic CMOS circuits. Through simulation of a simple
generic coupled oscillator network, we compare the operation of these readout
techniques with a previously proposed full statistics evaluation scheme. Our
approaches provide results nearly identical to the mathematical method, but
also show better resilience to moderate noise, which is a major concern for
hardware implementations. These results open the door to widespread realization
of hardware coupled oscillator-based neural systems."
"Slime mould of Physarum polycephalum is a large cell exhibiting rich spatial
non-linear electrical characteristics. We exploit the electrical properties of
the slime mould to implement logic gates using a flexible hardware platform
designed for investigating the electrical properties of a substrate (MECOBO).
We apply arbitrary electrical signals to `configure' the slime mould, i.e.
change shape of its body and, measure the slime mould's electrical response. We
show that it is possible to find configurations that allow the Physarum to act
as any 2-input Boolean gate. The occurrence frequency of the gates discovered
in the slime was analysed and compared to complexity hierarchies of logical
gates obtained in other unconventional materials. The search for gates was
performed by both sweeping across configurations in the real material as well
as training a neural network-based model and searching the gates therein using
gradient descent."
"The present manuscript deals with the realization of Processing In-memory
(PIM) computing architecture using Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) and
Akers array. The PIM computing architecture becomes popular due to its
effective framework for storage and computation of data in a single unit. Here,
we illustrate two input NAND and NOR gate with the help of QCA based Akers
Array as a case study. The QCA flip-flop is used as a primitive cell to design
PIM architecture. The results suggested that both the gate have minimum power
dissipation. The polarization results of proposed architecture suggested that
the signals are in good control. The foot print of the primitive cell equals to
0.04 micron^2, which is smaller than conventional CMOS primitive cell. The
combination of QCA and Akers array provides many additional benefits over the
conventional architecture like reduction in the power consumption and feature
size, furthermore, it also improves the computational speed."
"Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on
the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices.
Although MC has been extensively studied from various aspects, limitations
imposed by the physical design of transceiving units have been largely
neglected in the literature. Recently, we have proposed a nanobioelectronic MC
receiver architecture based on the nanoscale field effect transistor-based
biosensor (bioFET) technology, providing noninvasive and sensitive molecular
detection at nanoscale while producing electrical signals at the output. In
this paper, we derive analytical closed-form expressions for the capacity and
capacity-achieving input distribution for a memoryless MC channel with a
silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receiver. The resulting expressions could
be used to optimize the information flow in MC systems equipped with
nanobioelectronic receivers."
"Memristor device modeling is currently a heavily researched topic and is
becoming ever more important as memristor devices make their way into CMOS
circuit designs, necessitating accurate and efficient memristor circuit
simulations. In this paper, the Generalized Metastable Switch (MSS) memristor
model is presented. The Generalized MSS model consists of a voltage-dependent
stochastic component and a voltage-dependent exponential diode current
component and is designed to be easy to implement, computationally efficient,
and amenable to modeling a wide range of different memristor devices."
"We report on experimental demonstration of a mixed-signal 6-tap
finite-impulse response (FIR) filter in which weights are implemented with
titanium dioxide memristive devices. In the proposed design weight of a tap is
stored with a relatively high precision in a memristive device that can be
configured in field. Such approach enables efficient implementation of the most
critical operation of an FIR filter, i.e. multiplication of the input signal
with the tap weights and summation of the products from taps, in analog domain.
As a result, the proposed design, when implemented with fully integrated hybrid
CMOS/memristor circuit, is expected to be much more compact and energy
efficient as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."
"Isotopic purification of group IV elements leads to substantial increase in
thermal conductivity due to reduced scattering of the phonons. Based on this
concept, a simulation study is used to demonstrate the reduction of at least 25
oC in LDMOS average temperature."
"In this paper, we study the bidirectional/two-way relaying of molecular
communication and propose a relaying scheme with two time slots. Compared to
the four-time-slot and three-time-slot schemes, the proposed two-time-slot
scheme improves the throughput by a significant extent by allowing the end
nodes to transmit simultaneously at the very first time slot. In contrast to
the existing techniques, the proposed scheme employs a homogeneous molecular
communication for bidirectional relaying where all the nodes (i.e., end nodes
and relay node) are allowed to operate on the same type of molecule instead of
utilizing different types of molecule for different nodes. As a result, this
proposal of homogeneous molecular relaying remarkably improves the resource
reuse capability. This paper generically characterizes the transmission and
detection strategies of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we derive the analytical
bit error probabilities for the multiple access and broadcast phases and
present the end-to-end bit error probability of the proposed scheme. It's
noteworthy that we take it into account the effect of molecular interference in
the theoretical derivations. Extensive simulation is carried out, and it is
shown that simulation results match very well with the derived theoretical
analysis."
"Since its inception the memristive fuse has been a good example of how small
numbers of memristors can be combined to obtain useful behaviours unachievable
by individual devices. In this work, we link the memristive fuse concept with
that of the Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS), exploit that link to
experimentally demonstrate a practical memristive fuse using TiOx-based ReRAM
cells and explain its basic operational principles. The fuse is stimulated by
trains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite
polarities. In response, we observe a gradual (analogue) drop in resistive
state followed by a gradual recovery phase regardless of input stimulus
polarity; echoing traditional, binary CRS behaviour. This analogue switching
property opens the possibility of operating the memristive fuse as a
single-component step change detector. Moreover, we discover that the
characteristics of the individual memristors used to demonstrate the memristive
fuse concept in this work allow our fuse to be operated in a regime where one
of the two constituent devices can be switched largely independently from the
other. This property, not present in the traditional CRS, indicates that the
inherently analogue memristive fuse architecture may support additional
operational flexibility through e.g. allowing finer control over its resistive
state."
"Memtranstor that correlates charge and magnetic flux via nonlinear
magnetoelectric effects has a great potential in developing next-generation
nonvolatile devices. In addition to multi-level nonvolatile memory, we
demonstrate here that nonvolatile logic gates such as NOR and NAND can be
implemented in a single memtranstor made of the Ni/PMN-PT/Ni heterostructure.
After applying two sequent voltage pulses (X1, X2) as the logic inputs on the
memtranstor, the output magnetoelectric voltage can be positive high (logic
""1""), positive low (logic ""0""), or negative (logic ""0""), depending on the
levels of X1 and X2. The underlying physical mechanism is related to the
complete or partial reversal of ferroelectric polarization controlled by
inputting selective voltage pulses, which determines the magnitude and sign of
the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient. The combined functions of both memory
and logic could enable the memtranstor as a promising candidate for future
computing systems beyond von Neumann architecture."
"In this paper, we present a resistive switching memristor cell for
implementing universal logic gates. The cell has a weighted control input whose
resistance is set based on a control signal that generalizes the operational
regime from NAND to NOR functionality. We further show how threshold logic in
the voltage-controlled resistive cell can be used to implement a XOR logic.
Building on the same principle we implement a half adder and a 4-bit CLA (Carry
Look-ahead Adder) and show that in comparison with CMOS-only logic, the
proposed system shows significant improvements in terms of device area, power
dissipation and leakage power."
"Non-linear neuron models overcomes the limitations of linear binary models of
neurons that have the inability to compute linearly non-separable functions
such as XOR. While several biologically plausible models based on dendrite
thresholds are reported in the previous studies, the hardware implementation of
such non-linear neuron models remain as an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a circuit design for implementing logical dendrite non-linearity
response of dendrite spike and saturation types. The proposed dendrite cells
are used to build XOR circuit and intensity detection circuit that consists of
different combinations of dendrite cells with saturating and spiking responses.
The dendrite cells are designed using a set of memristors, Zener diodes, and
CMOS NOT gates. The circuits are designed, analyzed and verified on circuit
boards."
"The switching time of a magnet in a spin current based majority gate depends
on the input vector combination, and this often restricts the speed of
majority-based circuits. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel
two-phase scheme to implement majority logic and evaluates it on an all-spin
logic (ASL) majority-based logic structures. In Phase 1, the output is
initialized to a preset value. Next in Phase 2, the inputs are evaluated to
switch the output magnet to its correct value. The time window for the output
to switch in Phase 2 is fixed. Using such a scheme, an n-input AND gate which
requires a total of (2n-1) inputs in the conventional implementation can now be
implemented with only (n+1) inputs. When applied to standard logic functions,
it is demonstrated that the proposed method of designing ASL gates are 1.6-3.4X
faster and 1.9-6.9X more energy-efficient than the conventional method, and for
a five-magnet full adder, it is shown that the proposed ASL implementation is
1.5X faster, 2.2X more energy-efficient, and provides a 16% improvement in
area."
"Finding a conceptually new way to control the magnetic state of media with
the lowest possible production of heat and simultaneously at the fastest
possible time-scale is a new challenge in fundamental magnetism [1-4] as well
as an increasingly important issue in modern information technology [5]. Recent
results demonstrate that exclusively in metals it is possible to switch
magnetization between metastable states by femtosecond circularly polarized
laser pulses [6-8]. However, despite the record breaking speed of the
switching, the mechanisms in these materials are directly related to strong
optical absorption and laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature
[9-12]. Here we report about ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in
transparent dielectrics. In ferrimagnetic garnet film a single linearly
polarized femtosecond laser pulse breaks the degeneracy between metastable
magnetic states and promotes switching of spins between them. Changing the
polarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net
magnetization in the garnet, write ""0"" and ""1"" magnetic bits at will. This
mechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read
magnetic recording event (< 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load
(< 6 J/cm3)."
"Ising spin model is considered as an efficient computing method to solve
combinatorial optimization problems based on its natural tendency of
convergence towards low energy state. The underlying basic functions
facilitating the Ising model can be categorized into two parts, ""Annealing and
Majority vote"". In this paper, we propose an Ising cell based on Spin Hall
Effect (SHE) induced magnetization switching in a Magnetic Tunnel Junction
(MTJ). The stochasticity of our proposed Ising cell based on SHE induced MTJ
switching, can implement the natural annealing process by preventing the system
from being stuck in solutions with local minima. Further, by controlling the
current through the Heavy-Metal (HM) underlying the MTJ, we can mimic the
majority vote function which determines the next state of the individual spins.
By solving coupled \textit{Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert} (LLG) equations, we
demonstrate that our Ising cell can be replicated to map certain combinatorial
problems. We present results for two representative problems - Maximum-cut and
Graph coloring - to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed device-circuit
configuration in solving combinatorial problems. Our proposed solution using a
Heavy Metal (HM) based MTJ device can be exploited to implement compact, fast,
and energy efficient Ising spin model."
"A novel scheme for non-volatile digital computation is proposed using
spin-transfer torque (STT) and automotion of magnetic domain walls (DWs). The
basic computing element is composed of a lateral spin valve (SV) with two
ferromagnetic (FM) wires served as interconnects, where DW automotion is used
to propagate the information from one device to another. The non-reciprocity of
both device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at
the input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The
proposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by
a long FM wire. Compared to the scheme based on non-local spin valves (NLSVs)
in the previous proposal, the devices can be operated at lower current density
due to utilizing all injected spins for local magnetization reversals, and thus
improve both energy efficiency and resistance to electromigration. This device
concept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input
majority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin
transport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel
and stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires. In addition to digital
computing, the proposed framework can also be used as a transducer between DWs
and spin currents for higher wiring flexibility in the interconnect network."
"While several paths have emerged in microelectronics and computing as
follow-ons to Turing architectures, and have been implemented using essentially
silicon circuits, very little beyond Moore research has considered: (1) first
biological processes instead of sequential instructions, and, (2) the
implementation of these processes exploiting particle physics interactions.
This last combination enables native spatial-temporal integration and
correlation, but also powerful interference filtering, gating, splitting and
more. These biological functions, their realization by quantum and charge
carrier interactions, allow proposing a novel computing architecture, with
interfaces, information storage, and programmability. The paper presents the
underlying biological processes, the particle physics phenomena which are
exploited, and the proposed architecture, as well as an algebraic design
formalism."
"A signal machine is an abstract geometrical model for computation, proposed
as an extension to the one-dimensional cellular automata, in which discrete
time and space of cellular automata is replaced with continuous time and space
in signal machine. A signal machine is defined as a set of meta-signals and a
set of rules. A signal machine starts from an initial configuration which is a
set of moving signals. Signals are moving in space freely until a collision.
Rules of signal machine specify what happens after a collision, or in other
words, specify out-coming signals for each set of colliding signals. Originally
signal machine is defined by its rule as a deterministic machine. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of non-deterministic signal machine, which may
contain more than one defined rule for each set of colliding signals. We show
that for a specific class of nondeterministic signal machines, called
k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine, there is a deterministic signal
machine computing the same result as the nondeterministic one, on any given
initial configuration. k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine is a
nondeterministic signal machine which accepts an input iff produces a special
accepting signal, which have at most two nondeterministic rule for each
collision, and at most k collisions before any acceptance."
"We have designed, fabricated, and successfully tested a prototype
mixed-signal, 28x28-binary-input, 10-output, 3-layer neuromorphic network (""MLP
perceptron""). It is based on embedded nonvolatile floating-gate cell arrays
redesigned from a commercial 180-nm NOR flash memory. The arrays allow precise
(~1%) individual tuning of all memory cells, having long-term analog-level
retention and low noise. Each array performs a very fast and energy-efficient
analog vector-by-matrix multiplication, which is the bottleneck for signal
propagation in most neuromorphic networks. All functional components of the
prototype circuit, including 2 synaptic arrays with 101,780 floating-gate
synaptic cells, 74 analog neurons, and the peripheral circuitry for weight
adjustment and I/O operations, have a total area below 1 mm^2. Its testing on
the common MNIST benchmark set (at this stage, with a relatively low weight
import precision) has shown a classification fidelity of 94.65%, close to the
96.2% obtained in simulation. The classification of one pattern takes less than
1 us time and ~20 nJ energy - both numbers much better than for digital
implementations of the same task. Estimates show that this performance may be
further improved using a better neuron design and a more advanced memory
technology, leading to a >10^2 advantage in speed and a >10^4 advantage in
energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art purely digital (GPU and custom)
circuits, at classification of large, complex patterns."
"Straintronic magneto-tunneling junction (s-MTJ) switches, whose resistances
are controlled with voltage-generated strain in the magnetostrictive free layer
of the MTJ, are extremely energy-efficient switches that would dissipate a few
aJ of energy during switching. Unfortunately, they are also relatively
error-prone and have low resistance on/off ratio. This suggests that as
computing elements, they are best suited for non-Boolean architectures. Here,
we propose and analyze a ternary content addressable memory implemented with
s-MTJs and some transistors. It overcomes challenges encountered by traditional
all-transistor implementations, resulting in exceptionally high cell density."
"Theoretical constructs of logical gates implemented with plant roots are
morphological computing asynchronous devices. Values of Boolean variables are
represented by plant roots. A presence of a plant root at a given site
symbolises the logical {\sc True}, an absence the logical {\sc False}. Logical
functions are calculated via interaction between roots. Two types of
two-inputs-two-outputs gates are proposed: a gate $\langle x, y \rangle
\rightarrow \langle xy, x+y \rangle$ where root apexes are guided by gravity
and a gate $\langle x, y \rangle \rightarrow \langle \overline{x}y, x \rangle$
where root apexes are guided by humidity. We propose a design of binary
half-adder based on the gates."
"Increase in image resolution require the ability of image sensors to pack an
increased number of circuit components in a given area. On the the other hand a
high speed processing of signals from the sensors require the ability of pixel
to carry out pixel parallel operations. In the paper, we propose a modified 3T
and 4T CMOS wide dynamic range pixels, which we refer as 2T-M and 3T-M
configurations, comprising of MOSFETS and memristors. The low leakage currents
and low area of memristors helps to achieve the objective of reducing the area,
while the possibility to create arrays of memristors and MOSFETs across
different layers within the chip, ensure the possibility to scale the circuit
architecture."
"By the progressive scaling of the feature size and power consumption in VLSI
chips the part of energy dissipated due to information loss in irreversible
computations will become a serious limitation in the near future. Quantum-dot
cellular automata (QCA) is an emerging nanotechnology with extremely low energy
dissipation which facilitates new computation paradigms such as reversible
computing. In this letter a novel reversible full adder-subtractor circuit
based on QCA is proposed. Our proposed design is implemented using only one
layer and does not require any rotated cells which significantly improves the
manufacturability of the design. In addition, it improves the cell count and
area by almost 45% and 50%, respectively, as compared to the existing QCA-based
single-layer and multilayer reversible full adders."
"Dispersion studies demonstrate that waveguide layout can be used to enhance
the bandwidth performance of multimode polymer waveguides for use in
board-level optical interconnects, providing >40 GHzxm without the need for any
launch conditioning."
"The memristor is promising to be the basic cell of next-generation
computation systems. Compared to the traditional MOSFET device, the memristor
is efficient over energy and area. But one of the biggest challenges faced with
researchers is how to program a memristor's resistance precisely. Recently, an
algorithm designed to save 8 valid bits in each memristor is proposed, but this
is still not sufficient for precise computation. In this paper, we propose a
crossbar-based memristor computation scheme supporting precise computations
whose operands have 32 valid bits. As a brief introduction, in a multiplication
with two operands, one operand is programmed as input signal, and the other
operand is saved into a so-called crossbar structure, which contains a group of
memristors, and each memristor saves several valid bits, usually one or two
bits only. The computation results,i.e. the multiplication of the two operands,
are contained in the outputs of the crossbar structure together with noise.
Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are then used to extract the valid bits,
which are the most significant bits of outputs. These valid bits can be
combined together with Digital-to-Analog Converters(DACs) to get the final
results. What's more, the precision of this computation scheme can be adjusted
according to the definition of the user, 32 valid bits at most, so it is
qualified for different application contexts."
"We have fabricated and successfully tested an analog vector-by-matrix
multiplier, based on redesigned 10x12 arrays of 55 nm commercial NOR flash
memory cells. The modified arrays enable high-precision individual analog
tuning of each cell, with sub-1% accuracy, while keeping the highly optimized
cells, with their long-term state retention, intact. The array has an area of
0.33 um^2 per cell, and is at least one order of magnitude more dense than the
reported prior implementations of nonvolatile analog memories. The demonstrated
vector-by-vector multiplier, using gate coupling to additional periphery cells,
has ~2% precision, limited by the aggregate effect of cell noise, retention,
mismatch, process variations, tuning precision, and capacitive crosstalk. A
differential version of the multiplier has allowed us to demonstrate sub-3%
temperature drift of the output signal in the range between 25C and 85C."
"Recently we have shown that it is possible to represent continuous amplitude,
continuous time, band limited signals with an error as small as desired using
pulse trains via the integrate and fire converter (IFC). The IFC is an ultra
low power converter and processing with pulse trains is compatible with the
trends in the silicon technology for very low supply voltages. This paper
presents the definition of addition in pulse trains created by the IFC using
exclusively timing information, and proofs that it constitutes an Abelian group
in the space of IFC pulse trains. We also show that pulse domain addition
corresponds to pointwise addition of analog signals."
"The integrate and fire converter (IFC) enables an alternative to digital
signal processing. IFC converts analog signal voltages into time between pulses
and it is possible to reconstruct the analog signal from the IFC pulses with an
error as small as required. In this paper, we present the definition of
multiplication in pulse trains created by the IFC based on time domain
operations and prove that it constitutes an Abelian group in the space of IFC
pulse trains. We also show that pulse domain multiplication corresponds to
pointwise multiplication of analog signals. It is further proved that pulse
domain multiplication is distributive over pulse domain addition and hence it
forms a field in the space of IFC pulse trains, which is an important property
for linear signal processing."
"The susceptibility of millimeter waveform propagation to blockages may
largely restrict the coverage of mmWave signals. To overcome blockages, we
propose to leverage two-hop device-to-device (D2D) relaying. Using stochastic
geometry, we derive expressions for the downlink coverage probability of a
relay-assisted mmWave cellular network when the D2D links (from relays to
destinations) are implemented in either the mmWave or microwave band. For
mmWave links, we derive the coverage probability using dominant interferer
analysis while accounting for both blockages and beamforming gains. For
microwave D2D links, with the Rayleigh fading assumption, we derive the
coverage probability considering different path loss models for line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links. Numerical results suggest that the
downlink coverage of a mmWave cellular network can be improved by enabling
two-hop D2D relay transmissions. In most situations, microwave D2D relays
achieve better coverage than mmWave D2D relays because microwave D2D links can
be established under NLOS conditions; however, mmWave D2D relays achieve better
coverage when the density of interferers is large because their antenna arrays
reject interference from off-boresight directions and blockages eliminate
interference from NLOS interferers."
"In the quest for novel, scalable and energy-efficient computing technologies,
many non-charge based logic devices are being explored. Recent advances in
multi-ferroic materials have paved the way for electric field induced low
energy and fast switching of nano-magnets using the magneto-electric (ME)
effect. In this paper, we propose a voltage driven logic-device based on the ME
induced switching of nano-magnets. We further demonstrate that the proposed
logic-device, which exhibits decoupled read and write paths, can be used to
construct a complete logic family including XNOR, NAND and NOR gates. The
proposed logic family shows good scalability with a quadratic dependence of
switching energy with respect to the switching voltage. Further, the proposed
logic-device has better robustness against the effect of thermal noise as
compared to the conventional current driven switching of nano-magnets. A
device-to-circuit level coupled simulation framework, including magnetization
dynamics and electron transport model, has been developed for analyzing the
present proposal. Using our simulation framework, we present energy and delay
results for the proposed Magneto-Electric Spin Logic (MESL) gates."
"Advanced neural interfaces mediate a bio-electronic link between the nervous
system and microelectronic devices, bearing great potential as innovative
therapy for various diseases. Spikes from a large number of neurons are
recorded leading to creation of big data that require on-line processing under
most stringent conditions, such as minimal power dissipation and on-chip space
occupancy. Here, we present a new concept where the inherent volatile
properties of a nano-scale memristive device are used to detect and compress
information on neural spikes as recorded by a multi-electrode array.
Simultaneously, and similarly to a biological synapse, information on spike
amplitude and frequency is transduced in metastable resistive state transitions
of the device, which is inherently capable of self-resetting and of continuous
encoding of spiking activity. Furthermore, operating the memristor in a very
high resistive state range reduces its average in-operando power dissipation to
less than 100 nW, demonstrating the potential to build highly scalable, yet
energy-efficient on-node processors for advanced neural interfaces."
"A switched-capacitor matrix multiplier is presented for approximate computing
and machine learning applications. The multiply-and-accumulate operations
perform discrete-time charge-domain signal processing using passive switches
and 300 aF unit capacitors. The computation is digitized with a 6 b
asynchronous successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter. The
analyses of incomplete charge accumulation and thermal noise are discussed. The
design was fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, and experimental measurements of
multiplication are illustrated using matched filtering and image convolutions
to analyze noise and offset. Two applications are highlighted: 1)
energy-efficient feature extraction layer performing both compression and
classification in a neural network for an analog front end and 2) analog
acceleration for solving optimization problems that are traditionally performed
in the digital domain. The chip obtains measured efficiencies of 8.7 TOPS/W at
1 GHz for the first application and 7.7 TOPS/W at 2.5 GHz for the second
application."
"Optical interconnects have attracted significant research interest for use in
short-reach board-level optical communication links in supercomputers and data
centres. Multimode polymer waveguides in particular constitute an attractive
technology for on-board optical interconnects as they provide high bandwidth,
offer relaxed alignment tolerances, and can be cost-effectively integrated onto
standard printed circuit boards (PCBs). However, the continuing improvements in
bandwidth performance of optical sources make it important to investigate
approaches to develop high bandwidth polymer waveguides. In this paper, we
present dispersion studies on a graded-index (GI) waveguide in siloxane
materials designed to deliver high bandwidth over a range of launch conditions.
Bandwidth-length products of >70 GHzxm and ~65 GHzxm are observed using a
50/125 um multimode fibre (MMF) launch for input offsets of +/- 10 um without
and with the use of a mode mixer respectively; and enhanced values of >100
GHzxm are found under a 10x microscope objective launch for input offsets of
~18 x 20 um^2. The large range of offsets is within the -1 dB alignment
tolerances. A theoretical model is developed using the measured refractive
index profile of the waveguide, and general agreement is found with
experimental bandwidth measurements. The reported results clearly demonstrate
the potential of this technology for use in high-speed board-level optical
links, and indicate that data transmission of 100 Gb/s over a multimode polymer
waveguide is feasible with appropriate refractive index engineering."
"Once referred to as the missing circuit component, memristor has come long
way across to be recognized and taken as important to future circuit designs.
The memristor due to its ability to memorize the state, switch between
different resistance level, smaller size and low leakage currents makes it
useful for a wide range of intelligent memory and computing applications. This
overview paper highlights broadly provides the uses of memristor in the
implementation of cognitive cells for different imaging and pattern matching
applications."
"Continuing demands for increased compute efficiency and communication
bandwidth have led to the development of novel interconnect technologies with
the potential to outperform conventional electrical interconnects. With a
plurality of interconnect technologies to include electronics, photonics,
plasmonics, and hybrids thereof, the simple approach of counting on-chip
devices to capture performance is insufficient. While some efforts have been
made to capture the performance evolution more accurately, they eventually
deviate from the observed development pace. Thus, a holistic figure of merit
(FOM) is needed to adequately compare these recent technology paradigms. Here
we introduce the Capability-to-Latency-Energy-Amount-Resistance (CLEAR) FOM
derived from device and link performance criteria of both active optoelectronic
devices and passive components alike. As such CLEAR incorporates communication
delay, energy efficiency, on-chip scaling and economic cost. We show that CLEAR
accurately describes compute development including most recent machines. Since
this FOM is derived bottom-up, we demonstrate remarkable adaptability to
applications ranging from device-level to network and system-level. Applying
CLEAR to benchmark device, link, and network performance against fundamental
physical compute and communication limits shows that photonics is competitive
even for fractions of the die-size, thus making a case for on-chip optical
interconnects."
"The inability of Moore's Law and other figure-of-merits (FOMs) to accurately
explain the technology development of the semiconductor industry demands a
holistic merit to guide the industry. Here we introduce a FOM termed CLEAR that
accurately postdicts technology developments since the 1940's until today, and
predicts photonics as a logical extension to keep-up the pace of
information-handling machines. We show that CLEAR
(Capability-to-Latency-Energy-Amount-Resistance) is multi-hierarchical applying
to the device, interconnect, and system level. Being a holistic FOM, we show
that empirical trends such as Moore's Law and the Makimoto's wave are special
cases of the universal CLEAR merit. Looking ahead, photonic board- and
chip-level technologies are able to continue the observed doubling rate of the
CLEAR value every 12 months, while electronic technologies are unable to keep
pace."
"Design paradigms of logic circuits with Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA)
have been extensively studied in the recent past. Unfortunately, due to the
lack of mature fabrication support, QCA-based circuits often suffer from
various types of manufacturing defects and variations, and therefore, are
unreliable and error-prone. QCA-based Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently
used in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear
feedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers. However, none of the
existing designs for QCA XOR gates have considered the issue of ensuring
fault-tolerance. Simulation results also show that these designs can hardly
tolerate any fault. We investigate the applicability of various existing
fault-tolerant schemes such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), NAND
multiplexing, and majority multiplexing in the context of practical realization
of QCA XOR gate. Our investigations reveal that these techniques incur
prohibitively large area and delay and hence, they are unsuitable for practical
scenarios. We propose here realistic designs of QCA XOR gates (in terms of area
and delay) with significantly high fault-tolerance against all types of cell
misplacement defects such as cell omission, cell displacement, cell
misalignment and extra/additional cell deposition. Furthermore, the absence of
any crossing in the proposed designs facilitates low-cost fabrication of such
systems."
"Images typically are represented as uniformly sampled data in the form of
matrix of pixels/voxels. Therefore, matrix multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) forms
the core of most state-of-the-art image analysis algorithms. While digital
implementation of MAC has generally been the preferred approach, high power
consumption is an impediment to adopting it for medical image analysis. In this
work, we present a time-domain signal processing architecture which performs
MAC operations with 7bit accuracy while consuming 400X lower energy than
digital implementation. The proposed architecture performs analog computation
using mostly digital circuits and is suitable for scaled CMOS technologies. The
proposed time-domain MAC architecture is expected to play a central role in
empowering the advancement of various on-chip image analysis operations."
"With the evolution of heterogeneous computing system, such as
network-on-chip, high-performance distributed computing, accelerator-rich
architectures and cluster computing, high-speed, energy-efficient and
low-latency interfaces among memory-to-processor and processor-to-processor
become the key technology to enable those technologies. Simultaneously, the
scaling of CMOS makes the switching speed of the transistor up to sub-THz.
Radio-frequency or even millimeter-wave modulated signaling interconnect has
unique features in ultra-low power operation, dynamic allocation of bandwidth
and low latency, compared with convention baseband signaling interconnect. In
this work, we overview the different generations of radio-frequency
interconnect (RF-I) technology, compare them with conventional baseband
signaling interconnect technologies. The limitations and potentials are also
discussed in the end."
"An improved version of stream arbitration based on multiband RF interconnect
(MRFI) is proposed. Thanks to the simultaneous multiple channel
transmitting/receiving feature of MRFI, dynamic bandwidth allocation is
achieved in the proposed arbitration algorithm. With dynamic bandwidth
allocation, MRFI based arbitration can guarantee 100% channel bandwidth
utilization, which is a significant improvement compared with original RF-I
based stream arbitration whose channel bandwidth utilization is only around
30%~50%."
"A thin-layer Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium is a powerful computing device
capable for implementing logical circuits, memory, image processors, robot
controllers, and neuromorphic architectures. We design the reversible logical
gates --- Fredkin gate and Toffoli gate --- in a BZ medium network of excitable
channels with sub-excitable junctions. Local control of the BZ medium
excitability is an important feature of the gates' design. A excitable
thin-layer BZ medium responds to a localised perturbation with omnidirectional
target or spiral excitation waves. A sub-excitable BZ medium responds to an
asymmetric perturbation by producing travelling localised excitation
wave-fragments similar to dissipative solitons. We employ interactions between
excitation wave-fragments to perform computation. We interpret the
wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. A presence of a wave-fragment at
a given site of a circuit represents logical truth, absence of the
wave-fragment --- logical false. Fredkin gate consists of ten excitable
channels intersecting at eleven junctions eight of which are sub-excitable.
Toffoli gate consists of six excitable channels intersecting at six junctions
four of which are sub-excitable. The designs of the gates are verified using
numerical integration of two-variable Oregonator equations."
"This paper investigates the potentials of using a hybrid memristor CMOS
technology, called MeMOS, for the realisation of ternary adders. Ternary adders
exploit the qualitative advantage of multi-value storage capability of
memristors compared to conventional CMOS flip-flops storing only binary values
in one cell. Furthermore they carry out an addition in $O(1)$ and are therefore
considered. The MeMOS approach is compared to a CMOS solution for the ternary
adders using multi value memristors as registers concerning the achievable
latency and the energy consumption. It is shown that using the TEAM, VTEAM
model and a model considering commercially available memristors from Known the
approach of using CMOS ternary adders using memristors as multi-value register
memory is to prefer. MeMOS circuits have advantages for a static operation
mode, i.e. if they are operated after a reset."
"This paper investigates the use of carbon nanotube field effect transistors
(CNFETs) for the design of ternary full adder cells. The proposed circuits have
been designed based on the unique properties of CNFETs such as having desired
threshold voltages by adjusting diameter of the CNFETs gate nanotubes. The
proposed circuits are examined using HSPICE simulator with the standard 32 nm
CNFET technology. The proposed methods are simulated at different conditions
such as different supply voltages, different temperature and operational
frequencies. Simulation results show that the proposed designs are faster than
the state of the art CNFET based ternary full adders."
"For nanotechnology, the semiconductor device is scaled down dramatically with
additional strain engineering for device enhancement, the overall device
characteristic is no longer dominated by the device size but also circuit
layout. The higher order layout effects, such as well proximity effect (WPE),
oxide spacing effect (OSE) and poly spacing effect (PSE), play an important
role for the device performance, it is critical to understand Design for
Manufacturability (DFM) impacts with various layout topology toward the overall
circuit performance. Currently, the layout effects (WPE, OSE and PSE) are
validated through digital standard cell and analog differential pair test
structure. However, two analog layout structures: the guard ring and dummy fill
impact are not well studied yet, then, this paper describes the current mirror
test circuit to examine the guard ring and dummy fills DFM impacts using TSMC
28nm HPM process."
"Optical interconnects play a key role in the implementation of high-speed
short-reach communication links within high-performance electronic systems.
Multimode polymer waveguides in particular are strong candidates for use in
passive optical backplanes as they can be cost-effectively integrated onto
standard PCBs. Various optical backplanes using this technology and featuring a
large number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently
demonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex
waveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>=25 Gb/s)
due to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch
conditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the
highly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore,
we present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode
waveguides and waveguide components (i.e. bends and crossings) that enable the
implementation of passive optical backplanes. The performance of these
components is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for
different waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication.
Useful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for
each waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters
depends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and
desired link bandwidth. As an application of these studies, the obtained
results are employed to optimise the loss performance of a 10-card shuffle
router and enable >=40 Gb/s data transmission."
"For nanotechnology nodes, the feature size is shrunk rapidly, the wire
becomes narrow and thin, it leads to high RC parasitic, especially for
resistance. The overall system performance are dominated by interconnect rather
than device. As such, it is imperative to accurately measure and model
interconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon.
Despite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device
models and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects.
Nevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too
complicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to
capture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this
problem, this paper describes a set of test structures that can be used to
study the timing performance (i.e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various
interconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to
estimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art
interconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be
easily embedded on die as a parasitic variation monitor. We have validated the
proposed structure on a test chip in TSMC 28nm HPM process. Recently, the test
structure is further modified to identify the serious interconnect process
issues for critical path design using TSMC 7nm FF process."
"To process the ever-increasing amounts of data, computing technology has
relied upon the laws of Dennard and Moore to scale up the performance of
conventional von Neumann machines. As these laws break down due to
technological limits, a radical departure from the processor-memory dichotomy
is needed to circumvent the limitations of today's computers. 'Memcomputing' is
a promising concept in which the physical attributes and state dynamics of
nanoscale resistive memory devices are exploited to perform computational tasks
with collocated memory and processing. The capability of 'memcomputing' for
performing certain logical and arithmetic operations has been demonstrated.
However, device variability and non-ideal device characteristics pose technical
challenges to reach the numerical accuracy usually required in practice for
data analytics and scientific computing. To resolve this, we propose the
concept of mixed-precision 'memcomputing' that combines a von Neumann machine
with a 'memcomputer' in a hybrid system that benefits from both the high
precision of conventional computing and the energy/areal efficacy of
'memcomputing'. Such a system can achieve arbitrarily high computational
accuracy with the bulk of the computation realized as low-precision
'memcomputing'. We demonstrate this by addressing the problem of solving
systems of linear equations and present experimental results of solving
accurately a system of 10,000 equations using 959,376 phase-change memory
devices. We also demonstrate a practical application of computing the gene
interaction network from RNA expression measurements. These results illustrate
that an interconnection of high-precision arithmetic and 'memcomputing' can be
used to solve problems at the core of today's computing applications."
"A novel processing-in-storage (PRinS) architecture based on Resistive CAM
(ReCAM) is described and proposed for Smith-Waterman (S-W) sequence alignment.
The ReCAM massively-parallel compare operation finds matching base-pairs in a
fixed number of cycles, regardless of sequence length. The ReCAM PRinS S-W
algorithm is simulated and compared to FPGA, Xeon Phi and GPU-based
implementations, showing at least 4.7x higher throughput and at least 15x lower
power dissipation."
"Recent advances in predictive data analytics and ever growing digitalization
and connectivity with explosive expansions in industrial and consumer
Internet-of-Things (IoT) has raised significant concerns about security of
people's identities and data. It has created close to ideal environment for
adversaries in terms of the amount of data that could be used for modeling and
also greater accessibility for side-channel analysis of security primitives and
random number generators. Random number generators (RNGs) are at the core of
most security applications. Therefore, a secure and trustworthy source of
randomness is required to be found. Here, we present a differential circuit for
harvesting one of the most stochastic phenomenon in solid-state physics, random
telegraphic noise (RTN), that is designed to demonstrate significantly lower
sensitivities to other sources of noises, radiation and temperature
fluctuations. We use RTN in amorphous SrTiO3-based resistive memories to
evaluate the proposed true random number generator (TRNG). Successful
evaluation on conventional true randomness tests (NIST tests) has been shown.
Robustness against using predictive machine learning and side-channel attacks
have also been demonstrated in comparison with non-differential readouts
methods."
"Neurons in the brain behave as non-linear oscillators, which develop rhythmic
activity and interact to process information. Taking inspiration from this
behavior to realize high density, low power neuromorphic computing will require
huge numbers of nanoscale non-linear oscillators. Indeed, a simple estimation
indicates that, in order to fit a hundred million oscillators organized in a
two-dimensional array inside a chip the size of a thumb, their lateral
dimensions must be smaller than one micrometer. However, despite multiple
theoretical proposals, there is no proof of concept today of neuromorphic
computing with nano-oscillators. Indeed, nanoscale devices tend to be noisy and
to lack the stability required to process data in a reliable way. Here, we show
experimentally that a nanoscale spintronic oscillator can achieve spoken digit
recognition with accuracies similar to state of the art neural networks. We
pinpoint the regime of magnetization dynamics leading to highest performance.
These results, combined with the exceptional ability of these spintronic
oscillators to interact together, their long lifetime, and low energy
consumption, open the path to fast, parallel, on-chip computation based on
networks of oscillators."
"Voltage driven magneto-electric (ME) switching of ferro-magnets has shown
potential for future low-energy spintronic memories. In this paper, we first
analyze two different ME devices viz. ME-MTJ and ME-XNOR device with respect to
writability, readability and switching speed. Our analysis is based on a
coupled magnetization dynamics and electron transport model. Subsequently, we
show that the decoupled read/write path of ME-MTJs can be utilized to construct
an energy-efficient dual port memory. Further, we also propose a novel content
addressable memory (CAM) exploiting the compact XNOR operation enabled by
ME-XNOR device."
"We have measured the transition process from the high to low resistivity
states, i.e., the reset process of resistive switching based memristors based
on Ni/HfO2/Si-n+ structures, and have also developed an analytical model for
their electrical characteristics. When the characteristic curves are plotted in
the current-voltage (I-V) domain a high variability is observed. In spite of
that, when the same curves are plotted in the charge-flux domain (Q-f), they
can be described by a simple model containing only three parameters: the charge
(Qrst) and the flux (frst) at the reset point, and an exponent, n, relating the
charge and the flux before the reset transition. The three parameters can be
easily extracted from the Q-f plots. There is a strong correlation between
these three parameters, the origin of which is still under study."
"Spin transfer torque oscillators (STOs) based on magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) devices are emerging as a possible replacement for complementary
metal-oxide semiconductors for radio-frequency (RF) signal generation.
Advantages include low power consumption, small device area, and large
frequency tunability. But such a single device cannot achieve the necessary
noise performance for RF applications. It has been reported lately that a
network of globally coupled STOs achieves significant improvement in phase
noise. The study here is to propose use of such coupled STOs as
self-oscillating RF mixers. Critical mixer performance parameters, including
conversion gain, output power, and linearity, are discussed."
"We discuss some claims that certain UCOMP devices can perform
hypercomputation (compute Turing-uncomputable functions) or perform
super-Turing computation (solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time). We
discover that all these claims rely on the provision of one or more unphysical
resources."
"Optical interconnect is a potential solution to attain the large bandwidth
on-chip communications needed in high performance computers in a low power and
low cost manner. Mode-division multiplexing (MDM) is an emerging technology
that scales the capacity of a single wavelength carrier by the number of modes
in a multimode waveguide, and is attractive as a cost-effective means for high
bandwidth density on-chip communications. Advanced modulation formats with high
spectral efficiency in MDM networks can further improve the data rates of the
optical link. Here, we demonstrate an intra-chip MDM communications link
employing advanced modulation formats with two waveguide modes. We demonstrate
a compact single wavelength carrier link that is expected to support 2x100 Gb/s
mode multiplexed capacity. The network comprised integrated microring
modulators at the transmitter, mode multiplexers, multimode waveguide
interconnect, mode demultiplexers and integrated germanium on silicon
photodetectors. Each of the mode channels achieves 100 Gb/s line rate with 84
Gb/s net payload data rate at 7% overhead for hard-decision forward error
correction (HD-FEC) in the OFDM/16-QAM signal transmission."
"In the last two decades, DNA self-assembly has grown into a major area of
research attracting people from diverse background. It has numerous potential
applications such as targeted drug delivery, artificial photosynthesis etc. In
the last decade, another area received wide attention known as DNA origami,
where using M13 virus and carefully designed staple strands one can fold the
DNA into desired 2-D and 3-D shapes. In 2016, a group of researchers at MIT
have developed an automated DNA nanostructures strategy and an open source
software 'daedalus' based on MATLAB for developing the nanostructures. In this
work, we present a truly open source software '3dnaprinter' based on Java
(without MATLAB) that can do the same work."
"As an intriguing ultra-small particle-like magnetic texture, skyrmion has
attracted lots of research interests in next-generation ultra-dense and low
power magnetic memory/logic designs. Previous studies have demonstrated a
single skyrmion-domain wall pair collision in a specially designed magnetic
racetrack junction. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of multiple
skyrmions with domain wall pair in a magnetic racetrack. The numerical
micromagnetic simulation results indicate that the domain wall pair could be
pinned or depinned by the rectangular notch pinning site depending on both the
number of skyrmions in the racetrack and the magnitude of driving current
density. Such emergent dynamical property could be used to implement a
threshold-tunable step function, in which the inputs are skyrmions and
threshold could be tuned by the driving current density. The threshold-tunable
step function is widely used in logic and neural network applications. We also
present a three-input skyrmion-based majority logic gate design to demonstrate
the potential application of such dynamic interaction of multiple skyrmions and
domain wall pair."
"In this paper we propose a novel method of realizing discrete-time (D-T)
signal amplification using Nano-Electro-Mechanical (NEMS) devices. The
amplifier uses mechanical devices instead of traditional solid-state circuits.
The proposed NEMS-based D-T amplifier provides high gain and operate on a wide
dynamic range of signals, consuming only a few micro watts of power. The
proposed concept is subsequently verified using Verilog-A model of the NEMS
device. Modifications in the proposed amplifier to suit different
specifications are also presented."
"Modern computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture are built from
silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors that need to
operate under practically error free conditions with 1 error in $10^{15}$
switching events. The physical dimensions of CMOS transistors have scaled down
over the past five decades leading to exponential increases in functional
density and energy consumption. Today, the energy and delay reductions from
scaling have stagnated, motivating the search for a CMOS replacement. Of these,
spintronics offers a path for enhancing the functional density and scaling the
energy down to fundamental thermodynamic limits of 100kT to 1000kT. However,
spintronic devices exhibit high error rates of 1 in 10 or more when operating
at these limits, rendering them incompatible with deterministic nature of the
von Neumann architecture. We show that a Shannon-inspired statistical computing
framework can be leveraged to design a computer made from such stochastic
spintronic logic gates to provide a computational accuracy close to that of a
deterministic computer. This extraordinary result allowing a $10^{13}$ fold
relaxation in acceptable error rates is obtained by engineering the error
distribution coupled with statistical error compensation."
"Synthesis of reversible logic circuits has gained great atten- tion during
the last decade. Various synthesis techniques have been pro- posed, some
generate optimal solutions (in gate count) and are termed as exact, while
others are scalable in the sense that they can handle larger functions but
generate sub-optimal solutions. Although scalable synthe- sis is very much
essential for circuit design, exact synthesis is also of great importance as it
helps in building design library for the synthesis of larger functions. In this
paper, we propose an exact synthesis technique for re- versible circuits using
model checking. We frame the synthesis problem as a model checking instance and
propose an iterative bounded model checking calls for an optimal synthesis.
Experiments on reversible logic benchmarks shows successful synthesis of
optimal circuits. We also illus- trate optimal synthesis of random functions
with as many as 10 variables and up to 10 gates."
"We present a memristive device based R$ ^3 $PUF construction achieving highly
desired PUF properties, which are not offered by most current PUF designs: (1)
High reliability, almost 100\% that is crucial for PUF-based cryptographic key
generations, significantly reducing, or even eliminating the expensive overhead
of on-chip error correction logic and the associated helper on-chip data
storage or off-chip storage and transfer. (2) Reconfigurability, while current
PUF designs rarely exhibit such an attractive property. We validate our R$ ^3
$PUF via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations in Cadence based on parameters of
real devices. The R$ ^3 $PUF is simple, cost-effective and easy to manage
compared to other PUF constructions exhibiting high reliability or
reconfigurability. None of previous PUF constructions is able to provide both
desired high reliability and reconfigurability concurrently."
"We discuss possible designs and prototypes of computing systems that could be
based on morphological development of roots, interaction of roots, and analog
electrical computation with plants, and plant-derived electronic components. In
morphological plant processors data are represented by initial configuration of
roots and configurations of sources of attractants and repellents; results of
computation are represented by topology of the roots' network. Computation is
implemented by the roots following gradients of attractants and repellents, as
well as interacting with each other. Problems solvable by plant roots, in
principle, include shortest-path, minimum spanning tree, Voronoi diagram,
$\alpha$-shapes, convex subdivision of concave polygons. Electrical properties
of plants can be modified by loading the plants with functional nanoparticles
or coating parts of plants of conductive polymers. Thus, we are in position to
make living variable resistors, capacitors, operational amplifiers,
multipliers, potentiometers and fixed-function generators. The electrically
modified plants can implement summation, integration with respect to time,
inversion, multiplication, exponentiation, logarithm, division. Mathematical
and engineering problems to be solved can be represented in plant root networks
of resistive or reaction elements. Developments in plant-based computing
architectures will trigger emergence of a unique community of biologists,
electronic engineering and computer scientists working together to produce
living electronic devices which future green computers will be made of."
"A memristor is a two-terminal nanodevice that its properties attract a wide
community of researchers from various domains such as physics, chemistry,
electronics, computer and neuroscience.The simple structure for manufacturing,
small scalability, nonvolatility and potential of using inlow power platforms
are outstanding characteristics of this emerging nanodevice. In this report,we
review a brief literature of memristor from mathematic model to the physical
realization. Wediscuss different classes of memristors based on the material
used for its manufacturing. Thepotential applications of memristor are
presented and a wide domain of applications are explainedand classified."
"The translation of emerging application concepts that exploit Resistive
Random Access Memory (ReRAM) into large-scale practical systems requires
realistic, yet computationally efficient, empirical models that can capture all
observed physical devices. Here, we present a Verilog-A ReRAM model built upon
experimental routines performed on TiOx-based prototypes. This model was based
on custom biasing protocols, specifically designed to reveal device switching
rate dependencies on a) bias voltage and b) initial resistive state. Our model
is based on the assumption that a stationary switching rate surface m(R,v)
exists for sufficiently low voltage stimulation. The proposed model comes in
compact form as it is expressed by a simple voltage dependent exponential
function multiplied with a voltage and initial resistive state dependent second
order polynomial expression, which makes it suitable for fast and/or
large-scale simulations."
"The Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a bio-electrochemical transducer converting
waste products into electricity using microbial communities. Cellular Automaton
(CA) is a uniform array of finite-state machines that update their states in
discrete time depending on states of their closest neighbors by the same rule.
Arrays of MFCs could, in principle, act as massive-parallel computing devices
with local connectivity between elementary processors. We provide a theoretical
design of such a parallel processor by implementing CA in MFCs. We have chosen
Conway's Game of Life as the 'benchmark' CA because this is the most popular CA
which also exhibits an enormously rich spectrum of patterns. Each cell of the
Game of Life CA is realized using two MFCs. The MFCs are linked electrically
and hydraulically. The model is verified via simulation of an electrical
circuit demonstrating equivalent behaviors. The design is a first step towards
future implementations of fully autonomous biological computing devices with
massive parallelism. The energy independence of such devices counteracts their
somewhat slow transitions - compared to silicon circuitry - between the
different states during computation."
"AI applications have emerged in current world. Among AI applications,
computer-vision (CV) related applications have attracted high interest.
Hardware implementation of CV processors necessitates a high performance but
low-power image detector. The key to energy-efficiency work lies in
analog-digital converting, where output of imaging detectors is transferred to
digital domain and CV algorithms can be performed on data. In this paper,
analog-digital converter architectures are compared, and an example ADC design
is proposed which achieves both good performance and low power consumption."
"Stochastic user equilibrium is an important issue in the traffic assignment
problems, tradition models for the stochastic user equilibrium problem are
designed as mathematical programming problems. In this article, a
Physarum-inspired model for the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium
problem is proposed. There are two main contributions of our work. On the one
hand, the origin Physarum model is modified to find the shortest path in
traffic direction networks with the properties of two-way traffic
characteristic. On the other hand, the modified Physarum-inspired model could
get the equilibrium flows when traveller's perceived transportation cost
complies with normal distribution. The proposed method is constituted with a
two-step procedure. First, the modified Physarum model is applied to get the
auxiliary flows. Second, the auxiliary flows are averaged to obtain the
equilibrium flows. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method, which is compared with the Method of
Successive Average method."
"In-memory computing is a promising approach to reducing the time and energy
spent on data transfers between the processor and memory, thereby alleviating
the processor-memory gap. We explore in-memory computing with STT-MRAM, which
is considered a promising candidate for future on-chip memories due to its
non-volatility, density, and near-zero leakage. We propose suitable
modifications to peripheral circuits that enable standard STT-MRAM arrays to
perform bitwise, arithmetic and complex vector operations. We address the key
challenge of computing reliably under process variations, by leveraging ECC
schemes that are employed for conventional memory operations to also correct
errors during in-memory computations. We propose architectural enhancements to
the instruction set and on-chip bus that enable the proposed design,
Spin-Transfer Torque Compute-in-Memory (STT-CiM), to be integrated into a
programmable computing system. We also present data mapping techniques to
increase the effectiveness of STT-CiM. We evaluate STT-CiM using a
device-to-architecture modeling framework, and integrate cycle-accurate models
of STT-CiM with a commercial processor and on-chip bus (NiosII and Avalon from
Intel). Our system-level evaluation shows that STT-CiM provides system
performance improvements of 3.93X on average (upto 12.4X), and concurrently
reduces memory system energy by 3.83X on average (upto 12.4X)."
"Adders are key building blocks of many error-tolerant applications.
Leveraging the application-level error tolerance, a number of approximate
adders were proposed recently. Many of them belong to the category of
block-based approximate adders. For approximate circuits, besides normal
metrics such as area and delay, another important metric is the error
measurement. Given the popularity of block-based approximate adders, in this
work, we propose an accurate and efficient method to obtain the error
statistics of these adders. We first show how to calculate the error rates.
Then, we demonstrate an approach to get the exact error distribution, which can
be used to calculate other error characteristics, such as mean error distance
and mean square error."
"As we move towards an era of hundreds of cores, the research community has
witnessed the emergence of opto-electronic network on-chip designs based on
nanophotonics, in order to achieve higher network throughput, lower latencies,
and lower dynamic power. However, traditional nanophotonics options face
limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher
static power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on
achievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an
emerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains
on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter
interaction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC
that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical
interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various
opto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with
HyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by
conventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space
exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a
performance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8x. To further validate our
estimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark
suite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x, with negligible
energy increase. We then further carry out performance and cost projections for
fully optical NoCs, using HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics. These
futuristic projections indicate that all-HyPPI NoCs would be two orders more
energy efficient than electronics, and two orders more area efficient than
all-photonic NoCs."
"With the advent of big data and deep learning, computation power has become a
bottleneck for many applications. Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed to
enable multiprocessor acceleration for deep learning computation, and efficient
arbitration is a key issue for high performance. In this paper, an arbitration
scheme based on interference of wave is proposed. In this scheme, home node
sends out multiple tokens in different frequencies, and nodes that are
competing for bus can capture token by sending out wave that cancels its
specific wave token. In this scheme, speed-of-light arbitration can be
achieved, and full information is available to all nodes in arbitration."
"Chaos is a phenomenon that attracted much attention in the past ten years. In
this paper, we analyze chaos-based signal processing, and proposed a chaos
processor to take advantage of chaos phenomenon. We also analyzed and
demonstrated two of its practical applications in communication and sound
synthesis."
"In molecular communication, the heavy tail nature of molecular signals causes
inter-symbol interference (ISI). Because of this, it is difficult to decrease
symbol periods and achieve high data rate. As a probable solution for ISI
mitigation, enzymes were proposed to be used since they are capable of
degrading ISI molecules without deteriorating the molecular communication.
While most prior work has assumed an infinite amount of enzymes deployed around
the channel, from a resource perspective, it is more efficient to deploy a
limited amount of enzymes at particular locations and structures. This paper
considers carrying out such deployment at two structures--around the receiver
(Rx) and/or the transmitter (Tx) site. For both of the deployment scenarios,
channels with different system environment parameters, Tx-to-Rx distance, size
of enzyme area, and symbol period, are compared with each other for analyzing
an optimized system environment for ISI mitigation when a limited amount of
enzymes are available."
"Nano devices have great potential to play a vital role in future medical
diagnostics and treatment technologies because of its non-invasive nature and
ability to reach delicate body sites easily as compared to conventional
devices. In this paper, a novel concept of cooperative communication for
in-vivo nano-network is presented to enhance the communication among these
devices. The effect on the system outage probability performance is conducted
for various parameters including relay lacement, number of relays, transmit
power, bandwidth and carrier frequency. Results show approximately a 10-fold
increase in the system outage performance whenever an additional relay is
included in the cooperative network, hence show a great potential of using
cooperative communication to enhance the performance of nano-network at
terahertz frequencies."
"Information processing has reached the era of big data. Big data challenges
are difficult to address with traditional Von Neumann or Turing approach. Hence
implementation of new computational techniques is highly essential.
Nanophotonics with its remarkable speed and multiplexing capability is a
promising candidate for such implementations. This paper proposes a novel
photonic computing system made-up of Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an optical
fiber spool to emulate a powerful machine learning technique called reservoir
computing. The proposed system is also integrated with a
time-division-multiplexing circuit to facilitate parallel computation of
multiple tasks which is first of its kind. The proposed design performs
large-scale tasks like spoken digit recognition, channel equalization, and
time-series prediction. Experimental results with standard photonic simulator
demonstrate significant performance in terms of speed and accuracy compared to
state of the art digital and software implementations."
"In his seminal paper, Chua presented a fundamental physical claim by
introducing the memristor, ""The missing circuit element"". The memristor
equations originally supposed to represent a passive circuit element because,
with active circuitry, arbitrary elements can be realized without limitations.
Therefore, if the memristor equations do not guarantee that the circuit element
can be realized by a passive system, the fundamental physics claim about the
memristor as ""missing circuit element"" loses all its weight. The question of
passivity/activity belongs to physics thus we incorporate thermodynamics into
the study of this problem. We show that the memristor equations are physically
incomplete regarding the problem of passivity/activity. As a consequence, the
claim that the present memristor functions describe a passive device lead to
unphysical results, such as violating the Second Law of thermodynamics, in
infinitely number of cases. The seminal memristor equations cannot introduce a
new physical circuit element without making the model more physical such as
providing the Fluctuation Dissipation Theory of memristors."
"In diffusion-based molecular communication, information particles locomote
via a diffusion process, characterized by random movement and heavy tail
distribution for the random arrival time. As a result, the molecular
communication shows lower transmission rates. To compensate for such low rates,
researchers have recently proposed the molecular multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) technique. Although channel models exist for single-input single-output
(SISO) systems for some simple environments, extending the results to multiple
molecular emitters complicates the modeling process. In this paper, we
introduce a technique for modeling the molecular MIMO channel and confirm the
effectiveness via numerical studies."
"Memristive crossbars have become a popular means for realizing unsupervised
and supervised learning techniques. Often, to preserve mathematical rigor, the
crossbar itself is separated from the neuron capacitors. In this work, we
sought to simplify the design, removing extraneous components to consume
significantly lower power at a minimal cost of accuracy. This work provides
derivations for the design of such a network, named the Simple Spiking Locally
Competitive Algorithm, or SSLCA, as well as CMOS designs and results on the
CIFAR and MNIST datasets. Compared to a non-spiking model which scored 33% on
CIFAR-10 with a single-layer classifier, this hardware scored 32% accuracy.
When used with a state-of-the-art deep learning classifier, the non-spiking
model achieved 82% and our simplified, spiking model achieved 80%, while
compressing the input data by 79%. Compared to a previously proposed spiking
model, our proposed hardware consumed 99% less energy to do the same work at 21
times the throughput. Accuracy held out with online learning to a write
variance of 3% and a read variance of 40%. The proposed architecture's
excellent accuracy and significantly lower energy usage demonstrate the utility
of our innovations. This work provides a means for extremely low-energy sparse
coding in mobile devices, such as cellular phones, or for very sparse coding as
is needed by self-driving cars or robotics that must integrate data from
multiple, high-resolution sensors."
"Over the last decade, memristive devices have been widely adopted in
computing for various conventional and unconventional applications. While the
integration density, memory property, and nonlinear characteristics have many
benefits, reducing the energy consumption is limited by the resistive nature of
the devices. Memcapacitors would address that limitation while still having all
the benefits of memristors. Recent work has shown that with adjusted parameters
during the fabrication process, a metal-oxide device can indeed exhibit a
memcapacitive behavior. We introduce novel memcapacitive logic gates and
memcapacitive crossbar classifiers as a proof of concept that such applications
can outperform memristor-based architectures. The results illustrate that,
compared to memristive logic gates, our memcapacitive gates consume about 7x
less power. The memcapacitive crossbar classifier achieves similar
classification performance but reduces the power consumption by a factor of
about 1,500x for the MNIST dataset and a factor of about 1,000x for the
CIFAR-10 dataset compared to a memristive crossbar. Our simulation results
demonstrate that memcapacitive devices have great potential for both Boolean
logic and analog low-power applications."
"As it is getting increasingly difficult to achieve gains in the density and
power efficiency of microelectronic computing devices because of lithographic
techniques reaching fundamental physical limits, new approaches are required to
maximize the benefits of distributed sensors, micro-robots or smart materials.
Biologically-inspired devices, such as artificial neural networks, can process
information with a high level of parallelism to efficiently solve difficult
problems, even when implemented using conventional microelectronic
technologies. We describe a mechanical device, which operates in a manner
similar to artificial neural networks, to solve efficiently two difficult
benchmark problems (computing the parity of a bit stream, and classifying
spoken words). The device consists in a network of masses coupled by linear
springs and attached to a substrate by non-linear springs, thus forming a
network of anharmonic oscillators. As the masses can directly couple to forces
applied on the device, this approach combines sensing and computing functions
in a single power-efficient device with compact dimensions."
"In 2011 the DNA seesaw gate motif was introduced. It is a powerful
feed-forward DNA nanodevice that can perform digital logic computations. The
landmark of that work managed to evaluate moderately large Boolean circuits by
cascading multiple DNA seesaw gates. Although the design is robust in solution
and scalable, it is designed for one time use and is not reusable. This
prevents pursuing important applications such as feedback and sequential
digital circuits. We present a novel design for DNA nanodevices that can
perform digital logic computations and are furthermore renewable. First, we
modified the prior DNA seesaw gate motif into a hairpin. We call the resulting
motif a DNA hairpin-seesaw gate. We show the feed-forward digital computation
reaction imitates the seesaw gate motif. Second, we added a reporting phase
that provides increased scalability to our device. Third, we designed input and
fuel extracting hairpins that when added, initiate a renewing process. This
results in a renewed functional gate, in its original configuration, which is
able to make a new logical computation with new inputs. Finally, we introduced
a renewable two-input Boolean logic OR gate. After calculating the output of a
certain input set, the circuit is restored and a new set of inputs is
introduced to compute the new output. We provide experimental fluorescent data
on three repeated rounds of executions of our hairpin gate motif and its
restoration, indicating gradual loss of response. Finally, we calculated rate
constants of our experimental data by fitting it to a second order reaction
model using maximum likelihood estimation method."
"A memristive device is a novel passive device, which is essentially a
resistor with memory. This device can be utilized for novel technical
applications like neuromorphic computation. In this paper, we focus on
anticipation - a capability of a system to decide how to react in an
environment by predicting future states. Especially, we have designed an
elementary memristive circuit for the anticipation of digital patterns, where
this circuit is based on the capability of an amoeba to anticipate periodically
occurring unipolar pulses. The resulting circuit has been verified by digital
simulations and has been realized in hardware as well. For the practical
realization, we have used an Ag-doped TiO2-x-based memristive device, which has
been fabricated in planar capacitor structures on a silicon wafer. The
functionality of the circuit is shown by simulations and measurements. Finally,
the anticipation of information is demonstrated by using images, where the
robustness of this anticipatory circuit against noise and faulty intermediate
information is visualized."
"In this paper, we present techniques and examples to reduce power consumption
and increase energy efficiency of autonomous wireless sensor nodes for the
Internet of Things. We focus on RF energy harvesting and data transfer, all of
which have a large impact on the device cost, lifetime and functionality. We
explore the co-design of antenna and electronics to increase RF-DC conversion
and efficiency and to improve the performance of the LNA. A high-efficiency
orthogonally switching charge pump rectifier is presented. Its measurement
results are presented, along with a discussion on how to define its power
conversion efficiency. To boost the rectifier output voltage, while presenting
the best output load to it, a DC-DC converter with maximum power point tracking
is presented. To transmit slowly-varying signals in a low-power manner, an
asynchronous data converter is discussed and two modalities of data
transmission are presented. The first one is a passive transmitter
implementation and the second a novel low-power sub-GHz UWB transmitter."
"The common feature of nearly all logic and memory devices is that they make
use of stable units to represent 0's and 1's. A completely different paradigm
is based on three-terminal stochastic units which could be called ""p-bits"",
where the output is a random telegraphic signal continuously fluctuating
between 0 and 1 with a tunable mean. p-bits can be interconnected to receive
weighted contributions from others in a network, and these weighted
contributions can be chosen to not only solve problems of optimization and
inference but also to implement precise Boolean functions in an inverted mode.
This inverted operation of Boolean gates is particularly striking: They provide
inputs consistent to a given output along with unique outputs to a given set of
inputs. The existing demonstrations of accurate invertible logic are
intriguing, but will these striking properties observed in computer simulations
carry over to hardware implementations? This paper uses individual micro
controllers to emulate p-bits, and we present results for a 4-bit ripple carry
adder with 48 p-bits and a 4-bit multiplier with 46 p-bits working in inverted
mode as a factorizer. Our results constitute a first step towards implementing
p-bits with nano devices, like stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions."
"We present a unique application of OxRAM devices in CMOS Image Sensors (CIS)
for dynamic range (DR) improvement. We propose a modified 3T-APS (Active Pixel
Sensor) circuit that incorporates OxRAM in 1T-1R configuration. DR improvement
is achieved by resistive compression of the pixel output signal through
autonomous programming of OxRAM device resistance during exposure. We show that
by carefully preconditioning the OxRAM resistance, pixel DR can be enhanced.
Detailed impact of OxRAM SET-to-RESET and RESET-to-SET transitions on pixel DR
is discussed. For experimental validation with specific OxRAM preprogrammed
states, a 4 Kb 10 nm thick HfOx (1T-1R) matrix was fabricated and
characterized. Best case, relative pixel DR improvement of ~ 50 dB was obtained
for our design."
"Memristors are passive elements that allow us to store information using a
single element per bit. However, this is not the only utility of the memristor.
Considering the physical chemical structure of the element used, the memristor
can function at the same time as memory and as a communication unit. This paper
presents a new approach to the use of the memristor and develops the concept of
resistive communication."
"The physical limitations of CMOS technology triggered several research for
finding an alternative technology. QCA is one of the emerging nanotechnologies
which is gaining attention as a substitute of CMOS. The main potential of QCA
is its ultra low power consumption, less area overhead, and high speed.
Majority and inverter gates are the basic gates in QCA,which together works as
a universal logic gate to implement any QCA circuit. This paper proposes an
efficient methodology for optimal QCA circuit synthesis of arbitrary
multi-output boolean functions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm based
approach is used to reduce worst case delay and gate count of a QCA circuit.
Different importance is given to worst case delay, no. of majority and no. of
inverter gates. Several efficient techniques are used in order to achieve the
optimal result and reduce the computational complexity furthermore additional
methodologies are used to eliminate redundancies from the final solution.
Comparison of the obtained results with the existing best techniques indicates,
the proposed technique outperforms in terms of worst case delay and gate count."
"Flow-based microfluidic biochips are widely used in lab- on-a-chip
experiments. In these chips, devices such as mixers and detectors connected by
micro-channels execute specific operations. Intermediate fluid samples are
saved in storage temporarily until target devices become avail- able. However,
if the storage unit does not have enough capacity, fluid samples must wait in
devices, reducing their efficiency and thus increasing the overall execution
time. Consequently, storage and caching of fluid samples in such microfluidic
chips must be considered during synthesis to balance execution efficiency and
chip area."
"With advancing process technologies and booming IoT markets, millimeter-wave
CMOS RFICs have been widely developed in re- cent years. Since the performance
of CMOS RFICs is very sensi- tive to the precision of the layout, precise
placement of devices and precisely matched microstrip lengths to given values
have been a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, and thus become a major
bottleneck for time to market. This paper introduces a progressive
integer-linear-programming-based method to gener- ate high-quality RFIC layouts
satisfying very stringent routing requirements of microstrip lines, including
spacing/non-crossing rules, precise length, and bend number minimization,
within a given layout area. The resulting RFIC layouts excel in both per-
formance and area with much fewer bends compared with the simulation-tuning
based manual layout, while the layout gener- ation time is significantly
reduced from weeks to half an hour."
"Fully Programmable Valve Array (FPVA) has emerged as a new architecture for
the next-generation flow-based microfluidic biochips. This 2D-array consists of
regularly-arranged valves, which can be dynamically configured by users to
realize microfluidic devices of different shapes and sizes as well as
interconnections. Additionally, the regularity of the underlying structure
renders FPVAs easier to integrate on a tiny chip. However, these arrays may
suffer from various manufacturing defects such as blockage and leakage in
control and flow channels. Unfortunately, no efficient method is yet known for
testing such a general-purpose architecture. In this paper, we present a novel
formulation using the concept of flow paths and cut-sets, and describe an
ILP-based hierarchical strategy for generating compact test sets that can
detect multiple faults in FPVAs. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method in detecting manufacturing faults with only a small number
of test vectors."
"Flow-based microfluidic biochips have attracted much atten- tion in the EDA
community due to their miniaturized size and execution efficiency. Previous
research, however, still follows the traditional computing model with a
dedicated storage unit, which actually becomes a bottleneck of the performance
of bio- chips. In this paper, we propose the first architectural synthe- sis
framework considering distributed storage constructed tem- porarily from
transportation channels to cache fluid samples. Since distributed storage can
be accessed more efficiently than a dedicated storage unit and channels can
switch between the roles of transportation and storage easily, biochips with
this dis- tributed computing architecture can achieve a higher execution
efficiency even with fewer resources. Experimental results con- firm that the
execution efficiency of a bioassay can be improved by up to 28% while the
number of valves in the biochip can be reduced effectively."
"In a recent paper M. Lopez-Suarez, I. Neri, and L. Gammaitoni (LNG) present a
concrete realization of the Boolean OR irreversible gate, but contrary to the
standard Landauer principle, with an arbitrary small dissipation of energy. A
Popperian good falsification! In this paper we discuss a theoretical
description of the LNG device which is indeed a 3in/3out self--reversible
realization of the involved OR gate, satisfying in this way the Landauer
principle of no dispersion of energy, contrary to the LNG conclusions. The
different point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs
corresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG
indistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard
2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs
indistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever
angles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the
OR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL
gate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the
self-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according
to the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate
it is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective
AND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles. Finally,
by other suitable normalization procedures on cantilever angles it is possible
to obtain also the other logic NOR and NAND connectives, and in a more
sophisticated way the XOR and NXOR connectives in a self-reversible way. All
this leads to introduce a universal logic machine consisting of the LNG device
plus a memory containing all the necessary angle normalization functions to
produce in a self-reversible way, by choosing one of these latter, the logic
connectives now listed."
"We represent a filamentous actin molecule as a graph of finite-state machines
(F-actin automaton). Each node in the graph takes three states --- resting,
excited, refractory. All nodes update their states simultaneously and by the
same rule, in discrete time steps. Two rules are considered: threshold rule ---
a resting node is excited if it has at least one excited neighbour and narrow
excitation interval rule --- a resting node is excited if it has exactly one
excited neighbour. We analyse distributions of transient periods and lengths of
limit cycles in evolution of F-actin automaton, propose mechanisms for
formation of limit cycles and evaluate density of information storage in
F-actin automata."
"For decades, conventional computers based on the von Neumann architecture
have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their
processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As
computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in
terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing
paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A
fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of
nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within
the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale
experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices
organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the
crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a
computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that
this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be
the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing
systems."
"FinFETs have replaced the conventional bulk CMOS transistors in the sub-20nm
technology. One of the key issues to consider is, the vulnerability of FinFET
based circuits to multiple node charge collection due to neutron-induced
strikes. In this paper, we perform a device simulation based characterization
study on representative layouts of 14nm bulk FinFETs in order to study the
extent to which multiple transistors are affected. We find that multiple
transistors do get affected and the impact can last up to five transistors away
(~200nm). We show that the potential of source/drain regions in the
neighborhood of the strike is a significant contributing factor. In the case of
multi-fin FinFETs, the charge collected per fin is seen to reduce as the number
of fins increase. Thus, smaller FinFETs are susceptible to high amounts of
charge collection."
"Mobile payment systems are increasingly used to simplify the way in which
money transfers and transactions can be performed. We argue that, to achieve
their full potential as economic boosters in developing countries, mobile
payment systems need to rely on new metaphors suitable for the business models,
lifestyle, and technology availability conditions of the targeted communities.
The Pay-with-a-Group-Selfie (PGS) project, funded by the Melinda & Bill Gates
Foundation, has developed a micro-payment system that supports everyday small
transactions by extending the reach of, rather than substituting, existing
payment frameworks. PGS is based on a simple gesture and a readily
understandable metaphor. The gesture - taking a selfie - has become part of the
lifestyle of mobile phone users worldwide, including non-technology-savvy ones.
The metaphor likens computing two visual shares of the selfie to ripping a
banknote in two, a technique used for decades for delayed payment in cash-only
markets. PGS is designed to work with devices with limited computational power
and when connectivity is patchy or not always available. Thanks to visual
cryptography techniques PGS uses for computing the shares, the original selfie
can be recomposed simply by stacking the shares, preserving the analogy with
re-joining the two parts of the banknote."
"Probabilistic inference from real-time input data is becoming increasingly
popular and may be one of the potential pathways at enabling cognitive
intelligence. As a matter of fact, preliminary research has revealed that
stochastic functionalities also underlie the spiking behaviour of neurons in
cortical microcircuits of the human brain. In tune with such observations,
neuromorphic and other unconventional computing platforms have recently started
adopting the usage of computational units that generate outputs
probabilistically, depending on the magnitude of the input stimulus. In this
work, we experimentally demonstrate a spintronic device that offers a direct
mapping to the functionality of such a controllable stochastic switching
element. We show that the probabilistic switching of Ta/CoFeB/MgO
heterostructures in presence of spin-orbit torque and thermal noise can be
harnessed to enable probabilistic inference in a plethora of unconventional
computing scenarios. This work can potentially pave the way for hardware that
directly mimics the computational units of Bayesian inference."
"Variance-based logic (VBL) uses the fluctuations or the variance in the state
of a particle or a physical quantity to represent different logic levels. In
this letter we show that compared to the traditional bi-stable logic
representation the variance-based representation can theoretically achieve a
superior performance trade-off (in terms of energy dissipation and information
capacity) when operating at fundamental limits imposed by thermal-noise. We
show that for a bi-stable logic device the lower limit on energy dissipated per
bit is 4.35KT/bit, whereas under similar operating conditions, a VBL device
could achieve a lower limit of sub-KT/bit. These theoretical results are
general enough to be applicable to different instantiations and variants of VBL
ranging from digital processors based on energy-scavenging or to processors
based on the emerging valleytronic devices."
"We construct logical gates via topology optimisation (aimed to solve a
station problem of heat conduction) of a conductive material layout. Values of
logical variables are represented high and low values of a temperature at given
sites. Logical functions are implemented via the formation of an optimum layout
of conductive material between the sites with loading conditions. We implement
AND and XOR gates and a one-bit binary half-adder."
"Electrophysiological techniques have improved substantially over the past
years to the point that neuroprosthetics applications are becoming viable. This
evolution has been fuelled by the advancement of implantable microelectrode
technologies that have followed their own version of Moore's scaling law.
Similarly to electronics, however, excessive data-rates and strained power
budgets require the development of more efficient computation paradigms for
handling neural data in-situ, in particular the computationally heavy task of
events classification. Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsic analogue
programmability of memristive devices can be exploited to perform
spike-sorting. We then show how combining memristors with standard logic
enables efficient in-silico template matching. Leveraging the physical
properties of nanoscale memristors allows us to implement ultra-compact
analogue circuits for neural signal processing at the power cost of digital."
"Introduced below is a quantum database method, not only for retrieval but
also for creation. It uses a particular structure of true's and false's in a
state vector of n qubits, permitting up to 2**2**n words, vastly more than for
classical bits. Several copies are produced so that later they can be
destructively observed and a word determined with high probability. Grover's
algorithm is proposed below to read out, nondestructively the unknown contents
of a given stored state vector using only one state vector."
"Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and
optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but
more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD,
such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent.
While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which
are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading
to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for
simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking
problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum
communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust
for hundreds of qubits."
"The three-input TOFFOLI gate is the workhorse of circuit synthesis for
classical logic operations on quantum data, e.g., reversible arithmetic
circuits. In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed
into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has
been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of
its CNOT-optimality.
  We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and
implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe
the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity
of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective
circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least
2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of
three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla
qubits are available."
"We perform formal verification of quantum circuits by integrating several
techniques specialized to particular classes of circuits. Our verification
methodology is based on the new notion of a reversible miter that allows one to
leverage existing techniques for circuit simplification of quantum circuits.
For reversible circuits which arise as runtime bottlenecks of key quantum
algorithms, we develop several verification techniques and empirically compare
them.
  We also combine existing quantum verification tools with the use of
SAT-solvers. Experiments with circuits for Shor's number-factoring algorithm,
containing thousands of gates, show improvements in efficiency by 3-4 orders of
magnitude."
"A software model of a reversible processor ReveR with the stack is discussed
in this paper. An architecture, the minimal set of elementary reversible
operations together with an implementation of the basic control flow structures
and procedures calls using simple assembler language are described."
"Irregular arrangements of vesicles filled with excitable and precipitating
chemical systems are imitated by Voronoi automata --- finite-state machines
defined on a planar Voronoi diagram. Every Voronoi cell takes four states:
resting, excited, refractory and precipitate. A resting cell excites if it has
at least one excited neighbour; the cell precipitates if a ratio of excited
cells in its neighbourhood to its number of neighbours exceed certain
threshold. To approximate a Voronoi diagram on Voronoi automata we project a
planar set onto automaton lattice, thus cells corresponding to data-points are
excited. Excitation waves propagate across the Voronoi automaton, interact with
each other and form precipitate in result of the interaction. Configuration of
precipitate represents edges of approximated Voronoi diagram. We discover
relation between quality of Voronoi diagram approximation and precipitation
threshold, and demonstrate feasibility of our model in approximation Voronoi
diagram of arbitrary-shaped objects and a skeleton of a planar shape."
"Computing a polygon defining a set of planar points is a classical problem of
modern computational geometry. In laboratory experiments we demonstrate that a
concave hull, a connected alpha-shape without holes, of a finite planar set is
approximated by slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We represent planar points
with sources of long-distance attractants and short-distance repellents and
inoculate a piece of plasmodium outside the data set. The plasmodium moves
towards the data and envelops it by pronounced protoplasmic tubes."
"As conventional memory technologies are challenged by their technological
physical limits, emerging technologies driven by novel materials are becoming
an attractive option for future memory architectures. Among these technologies,
Resistive Memories (ReRAM) created new possibilities because of their
nano-features and unique $I$-$V$ characteristics. One particular problem that
limits the maximum array size is interference from neighboring cells due to
sneak-path currents. A possible device level solution to address this issue is
to implement a memory array using complementary resistive switches (CRS).
Although the storage mechanism for a CRS is fundamentally different from what
has been reported for memristors (low and high resistances), a CRS is simply
formed by two series bipolar memristors with opposing polarities. In this paper
our intention is to introduce modeling principles that have been previously
verified through measurements and extend the simulation principles based on
memristors to CRS devices and hence provide an analytical approach to the
design of a CRS array. The presented approach creates the necessary design
methodology platform that will assist designers in implementation of CRS
devices in future systems."
"This paper presents the process optimization of a single-electron nanoflash
electron memory. Self-aligned single dot memory structures have been fabricated
using a wet anisotropic oxidation of a silicon nanowire. One of the main issue
was to clarify the process conditions for the dot formation. Based on the
process modeling, the influence of various parameters (oxidation temperature,
nanowire shape) has been investigated. The necessity of a sharp compromise
between these different parameters to ensure the presence of the memory dot has
been established. In order to propose an aggressive memory cell, the
downscaling of the device has been carefully studied. Scaling rules show that
the size of the original device could be reduced by a factor of 2. This point
has been previously confirmed by the realization of single-electron memory
devices."
"We improve the precision of a previous Control Flow Analysis for Brane
Calculi, by adding information on the context and introducing causality
information on the membranes. This allows us to prove some biological
properties on the behaviour of systems specified in Brane Calculi."
"This paper presents a novel resistive-only Binary and Ternary Content
Addressable Memory (B/TCAM) cell that consists of two Complementary Resistive
Switches (CRSs). The operation of such a cell relies on a logic$\rightarrow$ON
state transition that enables this novel CRS application."
"We present new computational building blocks based on memristive devices.
These blocks, can be used to implement either supervised or unsupervised
learning modules. This is achieved using a crosspoint architecture which is an
efficient array implementation for nanoscale two-terminal memristive devices.
Based on these blocks and an experimentally verified SPICE macromodel for the
memristor, we demonstrate that firstly, the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP) can be implemented by a single memristor device and secondly, a
memristor-based competitive Hebbian learning through STDP using a $1\times
1000$ synaptic network. This is achieved by adjusting the memristor's
conductance values (weights) as a function of the timing difference between
presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. These implementations have a number of
shortcomings due to the memristor's characteristics such as memory decay,
highly nonlinear switching behaviour as a function of applied voltage/current,
and functional uniformity. These shortcomings can be addressed by utilising a
mixed gates that can be used in conjunction with the analogue behaviour for
biomimetic computation. The digital implementations in this paper use in-situ
computational capability of the memristor."
"We present a general method for analysing novel computational substrates to
determine which of their parameters can be manipulated to exhibit the complete
set of 2-input boolean logical operations. We demonstrate this approach with an
NMR-based case study, showing which NMR parameters can be used to perform
boolean logic."
"In most of the cases, the experimental study of Nanotechnology involves high
cost for Laboratory set-up and the experimentation processes were also slow.
So, one cannot rely on experimental nanotechnology alone. As such, the
Computer-Based molecular simulations and modeling are one of the foundations of
computational nanotechnology. The computer based modeling and simulations were
also referred as computational experimentations. In real experiments, the
investigator doesn't have full control over the experiment. But, in
Computational experimentation the investigator have full control over the
experiment. The accuracy of such Computational nano-technology based experiment
generally depends on the accuracy of the following things: Intermolecular
interaction, Numerical models and Simulation schemes used. Once the accuracy of
the Computational Scheme is guaranteed one can use that to investigate various
nonlinear interactions whose results are completely unexpected and unforeseen.
Apart from it, numerical modeling and computer based simulations also help to
understand the theoretical part of the nano-science involved in the
nano-system. They allow us to develop useful analytic and predictive models. In
this paper, a brief study of Computer-Based- Simulation techniques as well as
some Experimental result obtained using it were given."
"This paper shows experimentally that standard wireless networks which measure
received signal strength (RSS) can be used to reliably detect human breathing
and estimate the breathing rate, an application we call ""BreathTaking"". We show
that although an individual link cannot reliably detect breathing, the
collective spectral content of a network of devices reliably indicates the
presence and rate of breathing. We present a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
of breathing rate, amplitude, and phase, which uses the RSS data from many
links simultaneously. We show experimental results which demonstrate that
reliable detection and frequency estimation is possible with 30 seconds of
data, within 0.3 breaths per minute (bpm) RMS error. Use of directional
antennas is shown to improve robustness to motion near the network."
"Optical interconnects are foreseen as a potential solution to improve the
performance of data transmission in high speed integrated circuits since
electrical interconnects operating at high bit rates have several limitations
which creates a bottleneck at the interconnect level. The objective of the work
is to model and then simulate the MQWM based optical interconnect transmitter.
The power output of the simulated modulator is then optimized with respect to
various parameters namely contrast ratio, insertion loss and bias current. The
methodology presented here is suitable for investigation of both analog and
digital modulation performance but it primarily deals with digital modulation.
We have not included the effect of carrier charge density in multiple quantum
well simulation."
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been widely used as a demonstrative
medium for showcasing the ability for quantum computations to outperform
classical ones. A large number of such experiments performed have been
implementations of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It is known, however, that in
some cases the Deutsch-Jozsa problem can be solved classically using as many
queries to the black-box as in the quantum solution. In this paper we describe
experiments in which we take the contrasting approach of using NMR as a
classical computing medium, treating the nuclear spin vectors classically and
utilising an alternative embedding of bits into the physical medium. This
allows us to determine the actual Boolean function computed by the black-box
for the n=1,2 cases, as opposed to only the nature (balanced or constant) as
conventional quantum algorithms do. Discussion of these experiments leads to
some clarification of the complications surrounding the comparison of different
quantum algorithms, particularly black-box type algorithms."
"Reversible logic circuits have been historically motivated by theoretical
research in low-power electronics as well as practical improvement of
bit-manipulation transforms in cryptography and computer graphics. Recently,
reversible circuits have attracted interest as components of quantum
algorithms, as well as in photonic and nano-computing technologies where some
switching devices offer no signal gain. Research in generating reversible logic
distinguishes between circuit synthesis, post-synthesis optimization, and
technology mapping. In this survey, we review algorithmic paradigms ---
search-based, cycle-based, transformation-based, and BDD-based --- as well as
specific algorithms for reversible synthesis, both exact and heuristic. We
conclude the survey by outlining key open challenges in synthesis of reversible
and quantum logic, as well as most common misconceptions."
"This paper presents a hypothesis that consciousness is a natural result of
neurons that become connected recursively, and work synchronously between short
and long term memories. Such neurons demonstrate qubit-like properties, each
supporting a probabilistic combination of true and false at a given phase.
Advantages of qubits include probabilistic modifications of cues for searching
associations in long term memory, and controlled toggling for parallel,
reversible computations to prioritize multiple recalls and to facilitate
mathematical abilities."
"Current computers operate at enormous speeds of ~10^13 bits/s, but their
principle of sequential logic operation has remained unchanged since the 1950s.
Though our brain is much slower on a per-neuron base (~10^3 firings/s), it is
capable of remarkable decision-making based on the collective operations of
millions of neurons at a time in ever-evolving neural circuitry. Here we use
molecular switches to build an assembly where each molecule communicates-like
neurons-with many neighbors simultaneously. The assembly's ability to
reconfigure itself spontaneously for a new problem allows us to realize
conventional computing constructs like logic gates and Voronoi decompositions,
as well as to reproduce two natural phenomena: heat diffusion and the mutation
of normal cells to cancer cells. This is a shift from the current static
computing paradigm of serial bit-processing to a regime in which a large number
of bits are processed in parallel in dynamically changing hardware."
"While a couple of impressive quantum technologies have been proposed, they
have several intrinsic limitations which must be considered by circuit
designers to produce realizable circuits. Limited interaction distance between
gate qubits is one of the most common limitations. In this paper, we suggest
extensions of the existing synthesis flow aimed to realize circuits for quantum
architectures with linear nearest neighbor (LNN) interaction. To this end, a
template matching optimization, an exact synthesis approach, and two reordering
strategies are introduced. The proposed methods are combined as an integrated
synthesis flow. Experiments show that by using the suggested flow, quantum cost
can be improved by more than 50% on average."
"Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) synthesis in reversible circuits has emerged as
an important issue in terms of technological implementation for quantum
computation. The objective is to obtain a LNN architecture with minimum gate
cost. As achieving optimal synthesis is a hard problem, heuristic methods have
been proposed in recent literature. In this work we present a graph
partitioning based approach for LNN synthesis with reduction in circuit cost.
In particular, the number of SWAP gates required to convert a given gate-level
quantum circuit to its equivalent LNN configuration is minimized. Our algorithm
determines the reordering of indices of the qubit line(s) for both single
control and multiple controlled gates. Experimental results for placing the
target qubits of Multiple Controlled Toffoli (MCT) library of benchmark
circuits show a significant reduction in gate count and quantum gate cost
compared to those of related research works."
"We show that the space of density matrices for n-qubit states, considered as
a (2^n)^2 dimensional real vector space, has a basis consisting of density
matrices of stabilizer states. We describe an application of this result to
automated verification of quantum protocols."
"We present a theoretical and a numerical formalism for analysis and design of
spintronic integrated circuits (SPINICs). The formalism encompasses a
generalized circuit theory for spintronic integrated circuits based on
nanomagnetic dynamics and spin transport. We propose an extension to the
Modified Nodal Analysis technique for the analysis of spin circuits based on
the recently developed spin conduction matrices. We demonstrate the
applicability of the framework using an example spin logic circuit described
using spin Netlists."
"In a multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) IC the processor is one of the
highest heat dissipating devices. The temperature generated in an IC may vary
with floor plan of the chip. This paper proposes an integration and thermal
analysis methodology to extract the peak temperature and temperature
distribution of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional multiprocessor system-on-chip.
As we know the peak temperature of chip increases in 3-dimensional structures
compared to 2-dimensional ones due to the reduced space in intra-layer and
inter-layer components. In sub-nanometre scale technologies, it is inevitable
to analysis the heat developed in individual chip to extract the temperature
distribution of the entire chip. With the technology scaling in new generation
ICs more and more components are integrated to a smaller area. Along with the
other parameters threshold voltage is also scaled down which results in
exponential increase in leakage current. This has resulted in rise in hotspot
temperature value due to increase in leakage power. In this paper, we have
analysed the temperature developed in an IC with four identical processors at
2.4 GHz in different floorplans. The analysis has been done for both 2D and 3D
arrangements. In the 3D arrangement, a three layered structure has been
considered with two Silicon layers and a thermal interface material (TIM) in
between them. Based on experimental results the paper proposes a methodology to
reduce the peak temperature developed in 2D and 3D integrated circuits ."
"We analyse the results of our experimental laboratory approximation of
motorways networks with slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Motorway networks of
fourteen geographical areas are considered: Australia, Africa, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, Germany, Iberia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, UK,
USA. For each geographical entity we represented major urban areas by oat
flakes and inoculated the slime mould in a capital. After slime mould spanned
all urban areas with a network of its protoplasmic tubes we extracted a
generalised Physarum graph from the network and compared the graphs with an
abstract motorway graph using most common measures. The measures employed are
the number of independent cycles, cohesion, shortest paths lengths, diameter,
the Harary index and the Randic index. We obtained a series of intriguing
results, and found that the slime mould approximates best of all the motorway
graphs of Belgium, Canada and China, and that for all entities studied the best
match between Physarum and motorway graphs is detected by the Randic index
(molecular branching index)."
"A recently developed computational methodology for executing numerical
calculations with infinities and infinitesimals is described in this paper. The
developed approach has a pronounced applied character and is based on the
principle `The part is less than the whole' introduced by Ancient Greeks. This
principle is used with respect to all numbers (finite, infinite, and
infinitesimal) and to all sets and processes (finite and infinite). The point
of view on infinities and infinitesimals (and in general, on Mathematics)
presented in this paper uses strongly physical ideas emphasizing interrelations
holding between a mathematical object under the observation and tools used for
this observation. It is shown how a new numeral system allowing one to express
different infinite and infinitesimal quantities in a unique framework can be
used for theoretical and computational purposes. Numerous examples dealing with
infinite sets, divergent series, limits, and probability theory are given."
"The use of robotics in food industry is becoming more popular in recent
years. The trend seems to continue as long as the robotics technology meets
diverse and challenging needs of the food producers. Rapid developments in
digital computers and control systems technologies have significant impact in
robotics like any other engineering fields. By utilizing new hardware and
software tools, design of these complex systems that need strong integration of
distinct disciplines is no longer difficult compared to the past. Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to design and implement a micro-controller based
on reliable and high performance robotic system for food / biscuit
manufacturing line. We propose a design of a vehicle. The robot is capable of
picking unbaked biscuits tray and places them into furnace and then after
baking it picks the biscuits tray from the furnace. A special gripper is
designed to pick and place the biscuits tray with flexibility."
"Soldier crabs Mictyris guinotae exhibit pronounced swarming behaviour. The
swarms of the crabs tolerant of perturbations. In computer models and
laboratory experiments we demonstrate that swarms of soldier crabs can
implement logical gates when placed in a geometrically constrained environment."
"This paper proposes a coordinated home energy management system (HEMS)
architecture where the distributed residential units cooperate with each other
to achieve real-time power balancing. The economic benefits for the retailer
and incentives for the customers to participate in the proposed coordinated
HEMS program are given. We formulate the coordinated HEMS design problem as a
dynamic programming (DP) and use approximate DP approaches to efficiently
handle the design problem. A distributed implementation algorithm based on the
convex optimization based dual decomposition technique is also presented. Our
focus in the current paper is on the deferrable appliances, such as Plug-in
(Hybrid) Electric Vehicles (PHEV), in view of their higher impact on the grid
stability. Simulation results shows that the proposed coordinated HEMS
architecture can efficiently improve the real-time power balancing."
"Although noise-based logic shows potential advantages of reduced power
dissipation and the ability of large parallel operations with low hardware and
time complexity the question still persist: is randomness really needed out of
orthogonality? In this Letter, after some general thermodynamical
considerations, we show relevant examples where we compare the computational
complexity of logic systems based on orthogonal noise and sinusoidal signals,
respectively. The conclusion is that in certain special-purpose applications
noise-based logic is exponentially better than its sinusoidal version: its
computational complexity can be exponentially smaller to perform the same task."
"We introduce a scheme for controlling physical and other quantities;
utilizing noise-based logic for control-and-optimization with high
dimensionality, similarly how the Hilbert space of quantum informatics can be
utilized for such purpose. As a concrete realization of the noise-based control
scheme, we introduce ""Dictatorial control"" where noise-based logic results in
an exponential speedup of operation."
"We present an algorithm for computing depth-optimal decompositions of logical
operations, leveraging a meet-in-the-middle technique to provide a significant
speed-up over simple brute force algorithms. As an illustration of our method
we implemented this algorithm and found factorizations of the commonly used
quantum logical operations into elementary gates in the Clifford+T set. In
particular, we report a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of
Clifford and T gates. Our decomposition achieves a total T-depth of 3, thereby
providing a 40% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the
Toffoli gate. Due to the size of the search space the algorithm is only
practical for small parameters, such as the number of qubits, and the number of
gates in an optimal implementation."
"It has been shown recently that the use of two pairs of resistors with
enhanced Johnson-noise and a Kirchhoff-loop-i.e., a Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise
(KLJN) protocol-for secure key distribution leads to information theoretic
security levels superior to those of a quantum key distribution, including a
natural immunity against a man-in-the-middle attack. This issue is becoming
particularly timely because of the recent full cracks of practical quantum
communicators, as shown in numerous peer-reviewed publications. This
presentation first briefly surveys the KLJN system and then discusses related,
essential questions such as: what are perfect and imperfect security
characteristics of key distribution, and how can these two types of securities
be unconditional (or information theoretical)? Finally the presentation
contains a live demonstration."
"We present a design-scheme for ultra-low power neuromorphic hardware using
emerging spin-devices. We propose device models for 'neuron', based on lateral
spin valves and domain wall magnets that can operate at ultra-low terminal
voltage of ~20 mV, resulting in small computation energy. Magnetic tunnel
junctions are employed for interfacing the spin-neurons with charge-based
devices like CMOS, for large-scale networks. Device-circuit
co-simulation-framework is used for simulating such hybrid designs, in order to
evaluate system-level performance. We present the design of different classes
of neuromorphic architectures using the proposed scheme that can be suitable
for different applications like, analog-data-sensing, data-conversion,
cognitive-computing, associative memory, programmable-logic and analog and
digital signal processing. We show that the spin-based neuromorphic designs can
achieve 15X-300X lower computation energy for these applications; as compared
to state of art CMOS designs."
"In this paper, we show the equivalence of the set of unitaries computable by
the circuits over the Clifford and T library and the set of unitaries over the
ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},i]$, in the single-qubit case. We report an
efficient synthesis algorithm, with an exact optimality guarantee on the number
of Hadamard and T gates used. We conjecture that the equivalence of the sets of
unitaries implementable by circuits over the Clifford and T library and
unitaries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},i]$ holds in the
$n$-qubit case."
"In this paper we develop a formalism allowing us to describe operating of a
network based on the parametrical four-wave mixing process that is well-known
in nonlinear optics. The recognition power of a network using parametric
neurons operating with q different frequencies is considered. It is shown that
the storage capacity of such a network is higher compared with the Potts-glass
models."
"Reasoned by its dynamical behavior, the memristor enables a lot of new
applications in analog circuit design. Since some realizations are shown (e.g.
2007 by Hewlett Packard), the development of applications with memristors
becomes more and more interesting. Whereas most of the research was done in the
direction of memristor applications in neural networks and storage devices,
less publications deal with practical applications of analog memristive
circuits. But this topic is also promising further applications. Therefore,
this article proposes a frequency dependent rectifier memristor bridge for
different purposes (e.g. using as a programmable synaptic membrane voltage
generator for Spike-Time-Dependent-Plasticity) and describes the circuit
theory. In this context it is shown that the Picard Iteration is one
possibility to solve the system of nonlinear state equations of memristor
circuits analytically. An intuitive picture of how a memristor works in a
network in general is given as well. In this context some research on the
dynamical behavior of a HP memristor should be done."
"In this paper, simultaneous reduction of circuit depth and synthesis cost of
reversible circuits in quantum technologies with limited interaction is
addressed. We developed a cycle-based synthesis algorithm which uses negative
controls and limited distance between gate lines. To improve circuit depth, a
new parallel structure is introduced in which before synthesis a set of
disjoint cycles are extracted from the input specification and distributed into
some subsets. The cycles of each subset are synthesized independently on
different sets of ancillae. Accordingly, each disjoint set can be synthesized
by different synthesis methods. Our analysis shows that the best worst-case
synthesis cost of reversible circuits in the linear nearest neighbor
architecture is improved by the proposed approach. Our experimental results
reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach to reduce cost and circuit
depth for several benchmarks."
"As the proliferation of technology dramatically infiltrates all aspects of
modern life, in many ways the world is becoming so dynamic and complex that
technological capabilities are overwhelming human capabilities to optimally
interact with and leverage those technologies. Fortunately, these technological
advancements have also driven an explosion of neuroscience research over the
past several decades, presenting engineers with a remarkable opportunity to
design and develop flexible and adaptive brain-based neurotechnologies that
integrate with and capitalize on human capabilities and limitations to improve
human-system interactions. Major forerunners of this conception are
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which to this point have been largely focused
on improving the quality of life for particular clinical populations and
include, for example, applications for advanced communications with paralyzed
or locked in patients as well as the direct control of prostheses and
wheelchairs. Near-term applications are envisioned that are primarily task
oriented and are targeted to avoid the most difficult obstacles to development.
In the farther term, a holistic approach to BCIs will enable a broad range of
task-oriented and opportunistic applications by leveraging pervasive
technologies and advanced analytical approaches to sense and merge critical
brain, behavioral, task, and environmental information. Communications and
other applications that are envisioned to be broadly impacted by BCIs are
highlighted; however, these represent just a small sample of the potential of
these technologies."
"Automated synthesis from behavioural specifications is an attractive and
powerful way of constructing concurrent systems. Here we focus on the problem
of synthesising a membrane system from a behavioural specification given in the
form of a transition system which specifies the desired state space of the
system to be constructed. We demonstrate how a Petri net solution to this
problem, based on the notion of region of a transition system, yields a method
of automated synthesis of membrane systems from state spaces."
"In complex online social networks, it is crucial for a service consumer to
extract the trustworthiest way to a target service provider from numerous
social trust paths between them. The extraction of the trustworthiest way
(namely, optimal social trust path (OSTP)) with multiple end-to-end quality of
trust (QoT) constraints has been proved to be NP-Complete. Heuristic algorithms
with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal
with this challenging problem. However, existing solutions cannot guarantee the
efficiency of searching, that is, they can hardly avoid obtaining partial
optimal solutions during searching process. Quantum annealing uses
delocalization and tunneling to avoid falling into local minima without
sacrifying execution time. It has been proved to be a promising way to many
optimization problems in recently published literatures. In this paper, for the
first time, QA based OSTP algorithms (QA_OSTP) is applied to the extraction of
the trustworthiest way. The experiment results show that QA based algorithms
have better performance than its heuristic opponents."
"Reversible Logic is gaining significant consideration as the potential logic
design style for implementation in modern nanotechnology and quantum computing
with minimal impact on physical entropy .Fault Tolerant reversible logic is one
class of reversible logic that maintain the parity of the input and the
outputs. Significant contributions have been made in the literature towards the
design of fault tolerant reversible logic gate structures and arithmetic units,
however, there are not many efforts directed towards the design of fault
tolerant reversible ALUs. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the prime performing
unit in any computing device and it has to be made fault tolerant. In this
paper we aim to design one such fault tolerant reversible ALU that is
constructed using parity preserving reversible logic gates. The designed ALU
can generate up to seven Arithmetic operations and four logical operations."
"To understand Working of Human Brain measurements related to the brain
function are required. These measurements should be possibly non-invasive.
Brain should be disturbed as less as possible during the measurement.
Integration of various modalities plays a vital role in understanding the
cognitive and the behavioral changes in the human brain. It is an important
source of converging evidence about specific aspects of neural functions and
dysfunctions under certain pathological conditions. Focal changes in cortical
blood flow are tightly coupled with the changes in neuronal activity. This
constitutes the option to map the hemodynamic response and infer principles of
the cortical processing, even of complex tasks. The very high temporal
resolution of EEG and good spatial resolution by NIRS make this concurrent
measurement unique to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of large scale
neuronal networks in the human brain. Such integration of two techniques will
help to overcome the limitations of a specific method. Such as insensitivity of
electroencephalogram (EEG) to unsynchronized neural events or lack of near
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to low metabolic demand. A combination of EEG and
NIRS will be more informative than the two separate analyses in both
modalities."
"In previous work and motivated by a theoretical discussion on physical
realizations, a new quantum gate library (the NCV-v1 library) for electronic
design automation of quantum circuits has been proposed. Here, qudits instead
of qubits are assumed, i.e. a basic building block which does not rely on a two
level quantum system but a (multiple-valued) d-level quantum system is assumed.
However, the descriptions on the foundation of this new library remained brief.
This technical report provides an extended description of the applied ideas and
concepts."
"We classify and analyze bit errors in the current measurement mode of the
Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key distribution. The error probability
decays exponentially with increasing bit exchange period and fixed bandwidth,
which is similar to the error probability decay in the voltage measurement
mode. We also analyze the combination of voltage and current modes for error
removal. In this combination method, the error probability is still an
exponential function that decays with the duration of the bit exchange period,
but it has superior fidelity to the former schemes."
"We report experimental laboratory studies on developing conductive pathways,
or wires, using protoplasmic tubes of plasmodium of acellular slime mould
Physarum polycephalum. Given two pins to be connected by a wire, we place a
piece of slime mould on one pin and an attractant on another pin. Physarum
propagates towards the attract and thus connects the pins with a protoplasmic
tube. A protoplasmic tube is conductive, can survive substantial over-voltage
and can be used to transfer electrical current to lightning and actuating
devices. In experiments we show how to route Physarum wires with
chemoattractants and electrical fields. We demonstrate that Physarum wire can
be grown on almost bare breadboards and on top of electronic circuits. The
Physarum wires can be insulated with a silicon oil without loss of
functionality. We show that a Physarum wire self-heals: end of a cut wire merge
together and restore the conductive pathway in several hours after being cut.
Results presented will be used in future designs of self-growing wetware
circuits and devices, and integration of slime mould electronics into
unconventional bio-hybrid systems."
"A simple and general proof is given for the information theoretic
(unconditional) security of the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key exchange
system under practical conditions. The unconditional security for ideal
circumstances, which is based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is found to
prevail even under slightly non-ideal conditions. This security level is
guaranteed by the continuity of functions describing classical physical linear,
as well as stable non-linear, systems. Even without privacy amplification,
Eve's probability for successful bit-guessing is found to converge towards 0.5
- i.e., the perfect security level - when ideal conditions are approached."
"In experimental laboratory studies we evaluate a possibility of making
electrical wires from living plants. In scoping experiments we use lettuce
seedlings as a prototype model of a plant wire. We approximate an electrical
potential transfer function by applying direct current voltage to the lettuce
seedlings and recording output voltage. We analyse oscillation frequencies of
the output potential and assess noise immunity of the plant wires. Our findings
will be used in future designs of self-growing wetware circuits and devices,
and integration of plant-based electronic components into future and emergent
bio-hybrid systems."
"Energy harvesting or power harvesting or energy scavenging is a process where
energy is derived from external sources (e.g. solar power, thermal energy, wind
energy, salinity gradients, kinetic energy etc.), captured, and stored for
small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and
wireless sensor networks. This paper is focused to applications of Energy
Harvesting in Wireless Sensor Networks. This is going to help the ever growing
M2M (Machine to Machine) field where there is an exponential growth of
intelligent devices and automatic control of these is of paramount importance."
"Here, we introduce a new class of computer which does not use any circuit or
logic gate. In fact, no program needs to be written: it learns by itself and
writes its own program to solve a problem. Godels incompleteness argument is
explored here to devise an engine where an astronomically large number of
IfThen arguments are allowed to grow by self assembly, based on the basic set
of arguments written in the system, thus, we explore the beyond Turing path of
computing but following a fundamentally different route adopted in the last
half a century old non Turing adventures. Our hardware is a multilayered seed
structure. If we open the largest seed, which is the final hardware, we find
several computing seed structures inside, if we take any of them and open,
there are several computing seeds inside. We design and synthesize the smallest
seed, the entire multilayered architecture grows by itself. The electromagnetic
resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a
common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain
of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the
largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit)."
"In this paper, the problem of constructing an efficient quantum circuit for
the implementation of an arbitrary quantum computation is addressed. To this
end, a basic block based on the cosine-sine decomposition method is suggested
which contains $l$ qubits. In addition, a previously proposed quantum-logic
synthesis method based on quantum Shannon decomposition is recursively applied
to reach unitary gates over $l$ qubits. Then, the basic block is used and some
optimizations are applied to remove redundant gates. It is shown that the exact
value of $l$ affects the number of one-qubit and CNOT gates in the proposed
method. In comparison to the previous synthesis methods, the value of $l$ is
examined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total
number of gates. The proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the
nearest neighbor limitation. According to our evaluation, the number of CNOT
gates is increased by at most a factor of $\frac{5}{3}$ if the nearest neighbor
interaction is applied."
"The immune system is a highly parallel and distributed intelligent system
which has learning, memory, and associative capabilities. Artificial Immune
System is an evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological aspects of the
immune system of mammals. The immune system can inspire to form new algorithms
learning from its course of action. The human immune system has motivated
scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms
that has solved complex engineering problems. This work is the result of an
attempt to explore a different perspective of the immune system namely the
Immune Privileged Site (IPS) which has the ability to make an exception to
different parts of the body by not triggering immune response to some of the
foreign agent in these parts of the body. While the complete system is secured
by an Immune System at certain times it may be required that the system allows
certain activities which may be harmful to other system which is useful to it
and learns over a period of time through the immune privilege model as done in
case of Immune Privilege Sites in Natural Immune System."
"We present a novel hybrid CMOS-MQCA architecture using multi-layer Spintronic
devices as computing elements. A feasibility study is presented with 22nm CMOS
where new approaches for spin transfer torque induced clocking and read-out
scheme for variability-tolerance are introduced. A first-of-its-kind Spintronic
device model enables circuit simulation using existing CAD infrastructure.
Approximately 70% reduction in energy consumption is observed when compared
against conventional field-induced clocking scheme."
"We perform studies on electric field induced diffusion limited aggregation of
conductive particles dispersed in a non conductive medium. The bridges formed
across gaps between electrodes with an electric field in between due to the
aggregation mechanism provides a means to automate the correction of open
interconnect faults for integrated circuit application. We derive an expression
for the bridging time and describe the mechanics of bridge formation with the
above application in mind."
"A polariton condensate transistor switch is realized through optical
excitation of a microcavity ridge with two beams. The ballistically ejected
polaritons from a condensate formed at the source are gated using the 20 times
weaker second beam to switch on and off the flux of polaritons. In the absence
of the gate beam the small built-in detuning creates potential landscape in
which ejected polaritons are channelled toward the end of the ridge where they
condense. The low loss photon-like propagation combined with strong
nonlinearities associated with their excitonic component makes polariton based
transistors particularly attractive for the implementation of all-optical
integrated circuits."
"Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASN) is an emerging technology which
uses wireless sensors to implement real-time wearable health monitoring of
patients to enhance independent living. In this paper we propose a prototype of
cloud mobile health monitoring system. The system uses WBASN and Smartphone
application that uses cloud computing, location data and a neural network to
determine the state of patients."
"In this work, we describe the first modular, and programmable platform
capable of transmitting a text message using chemical signalling -- a method
also known as molecular communication. This form of communication is attractive
for applications where conventional wireless systems perform poorly, from
nanotechnology to urban health monitoring. Using examples, we demonstrate the
use of our platform as a testbed for molecular communication, and illustrate
the features of these communication systems using experiments. By providing a
simple and inexpensive means of performing experiments, our system fills an
important gap in the molecular communication literature, where much current
work is done in simulation with simplified system models. A key finding in this
paper is that these systems are often nonlinear in practice, whereas current
simulations and analysis often assume that the system is linear. However, as we
show in this work, despite the nonlinearity, reliable communication is still
possible. Furthermore, this work motivates future studies on more realistic
modelling, analysis, and design of theoretical models and algorithms for these
systems."
"Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum
computing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of
classical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been
demonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of
calculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what
humans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass
what our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.
At the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those
advances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the
discrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological
advances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive
landscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical
systems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will
discuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends."
"In a topological quantum computer, universality is achieved by braiding and
quantum information is natively protected from small local errors. We address
the problem of compiling single-qubit quantum operations into braid
representations for non-abelian quasiparticles described by the Fibonacci anyon
model. We develop a probabilistically polynomial algorithm that outputs a braid
pattern to approximate a given single-qubit unitary to a desired precision. We
also classify the single-qubit unitaries that can be implemented exactly by a
Fibonacci anyon braid pattern and present an efficient algorithm to produce
their braid patterns. Our techniques produce braid patterns that meet the
uniform asymptotic lower bound on the compiled circuit depth and thus are
depth-optimal asymptotically. Our compiled circuits are significantly shorter
than those output by prior state-of-the-art methods, resulting in improvements
in depth by factors ranging from 20 to 1000 for precisions ranging between
$10^{-10}$ and $10^{-30}$."
"Reversible computing has emerged as a possible low cost alternative to
conventional computing in terms of speed, power consumption and computing
capability. In order to achieve reliable circuits in reversible computing,
provision for fault tolerance is necessary. A number of fault models, fault
tolerant techniques (such as parity-preserving) and testing approaches have
proposed in literature. This dissertation exploits parity-preserving
characteristics of two reversible gates which provide low cost
parity-preserving based fault tolerance. In order to extend online testability
of reversible circuits, the substitution of Peres gate has been presented. The
online testing capabilities of MCF including Swap and Fredkin gates were also
identifies. Finally a tool was developed to implement all above substitutions
and converting any reversible circuit to parity-preserving based fault tolerant
circuit."
"The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large single cell visible with
the naked eye. When inoculated on a substrate with attractants and repellents
the plasmodium develops optimal networks of protoplasmic tubes which span sites
of attractants (i.e. nutrients) yet avoid domains with a high nutrient
concentration. It should therefore be possible to program the plasmodium
towards deterministic adaptive transformation of internalised nano- and
micro-scale materials. In laboratory experiments with magnetite nanoparticles
and glass micro-spheres coated with silver metal we demonstrate that the
plasmodium of P. polycephalum can propagate the nano-scale objects using a
number of distinct mechanisms including endocytosis, transcytosis and dragging.
The results of our experiments could be used in the development of novel
techniques targeted towards the growth of metallised biological wires and
hybrid nano- and micro-circuits."
"We use a specific geometric method to determine speed limits to the
implementation of quantum gates in controlled quantum systems that have a
specific class of constrained control functions. We achieve this by applying a
recent theorem of Shen, which provides a connection between time optimal
navigation on Riemannian manifolds and the geodesics of a certain Finsler
metric of Randers type. We use the lengths of these geodesics to derive the
optimal implementation times (under the assumption of constant control fields)
for an arbitrary quantum operation (on a finite dimensional Hilbert space), and
explicitly calculate the result for the case of a controlled single spin system
in a magnetic field, and a swap gate in a Heisenberg spin chain."
"In this paper, we consider a molecular diffusion based communications link
that conveys information on the macro-scale (several metres). The motivation is
to apply molecular-based communications to challenging electromagnetic
environments. We first derive a novel capture probability expression of a
finite sized receiver. The paper then introduces the concept of time-aggregated
molecular noise at the receiver as a function of the rate at which the sensor
can self-cleanse. The resulting inter-symbol-interference is expressed as a
function of the sensor cleanse time, and the performance metrics of bit error
rate, throughput and round-trip-time are derived. The results show that the
performance is very sensitive to the sensor cleanse time and the drift
velocity. The paper concludes with recommendations on the design of a real
communication link based on these findings and applies the concepts to a
test-bed."
"Junctionless Nanowire Field-Effect Transistors (JNFETs), where the channel
region is uniformly doped without the need for source-channel and drain-channel
junctions or lateral doping abruptness, are considered an attractive
alternative to conventional CMOS FETs. Previous theoretical and experimental
works [1][2] on JNFETs have considered polysilicon gates and silicon-dioxide
dielectric. However, with further scaling, JNFETs will suffer from deleterious
effects of doped polysilicon such as high resistance, additional capacitance
due to gate-oxide interface depletion, and incompatibility with high-k
dielectrics[3][4]. In this paper, novel metal- gated high-k JNFETs are
investigated through detailed process and device simulations. These MJNFETs are
also ideally suited for new types of nano-architectures such as N3ASICs [5]
which utilize regular nanowire arrays with limited customization. In such nano-
systems, the simplified device geometry in conjunction with a single-type FET
circuit style [6] would imply that logic arrays could be patterned out of
pre-doped SOI wafers without the need for any additional ion implantation."
"Continuous scaling of CMOS has been the major catalyst in miniaturization of
integrated circuits (ICs) and crucial for global socio-economic progress.
However, scaling to sub-20nm technologies is proving to be challenging as
MOSFETs are reaching their fundamental limits and interconnection bottleneck is
dominating IC operational power and performance. Migrating to 3-D, as a way to
advance scaling, has eluded us due to inherent customization and manufacturing
requirements in CMOS that are incompatible with 3-D organization. Partial
attempts with die-die and layer-layer stacking have their own limitations. We
propose a 3-D IC fabric technology, Skybridge[TM], which offers paradigm shift
in technology scaling as well as design. We co-architect Skybridge's core
aspects, from device to circuit style, connectivity, thermal management, and
manufacturing pathway in a 3-D fabric-centric manner, building on a uniform 3-D
template. Our extensive bottom-up simulations, accounting for detailed material
system structures, manufacturing process, device, and circuit parasitics,
carried through for several designs including a designed microprocessor, reveal
a 30-60x density, 3.5x performance per watt benefits, and 10X reduction in
interconnect lengths vs. scaled 16-nm CMOS. Fabric-level heat extraction
features are shown to successfully manage IC thermal profiles in 3-D. Skybridge
can provide continuous scaling of integrated circuits beyond CMOS in the 21st
century."
"Dual-layer resistive switching devices with horizontal W electrodes, vertical
Pd electrodes and WOx switching layer formed at the sidewall of the horizontal
electrodes have been fabricated and characterized. The devices exhibit
well-characterized analog switching characteristics and small mismatch in
electrical characteristics for devices formed at the two layers. The
three-dimensional (3D) vertical device structure allows higher storage density
and larger connectivity for neuromorphic computing applications. We show the
vertical devices exhibit potentiation and depression characteristics similar to
planar devices, and can be programmed independently with no crosstalk between
the layers."
"We study the performance of distance-three surface code layouts under
realistic multi-parameter noise models. We first calculate their thresholds
under depolarizing noise. We then compare a Pauli-twirl approximation of
amplitude and phase damping to amplitude and phase damping. We find the
approximate channel results in a pessimistic estimate of the logical error
rate, indicating the realistic threshold may be higher than previously
estimated. From Monte-Carlo simulations, we identify experimental parameters
for which these layouts admit reliable computation. Due to its low resource
cost and superior performance, we conclude that the 17-qubit layout should be
targeted in early experimental implementations of the surface code. We find
that architectures with gate times in the 5-40 ns range and T1 times of at
least 1-2 us range will exhibit improved logical error rates with a 17-qubit
surface code encoding."
"Recently, it was shown that Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) circuits can achieve a
$2.5$ times reduction in expected $T$-count over ancilla-free techniques for
single-qubit unitary decomposition. However, the previously best known
algorithm to synthesize RUS circuits requires exponential classical runtime. In
this paper we present an algorithm to synthesize an RUS circuit to approximate
any given single-qubit unitary within precision $\varepsilon$ in
probabilistically polynomial classical runtime. Our synthesis approach uses the
Clifford+$T$ basis, plus one ancilla qubit and measurement. We provide
numerical evidence that our RUS circuits have an expected $T$-count on average
$2.5$ times lower than the theoretical lower bound of $3 \log_2
(1/\varepsilon)$ for ancilla-free single-qubit circuit decomposition."
"We introduce a new property of tile self-assembly systems that we call
size-separability. A system is size-separable if every terminal assembly is a
constant factor larger than any intermediate assembly. Size-separability is
motivated by the practical problem of filtering completed assemblies from a
variety of incomplete ""garbage"" assemblies using gel electrophoresis or other
mass-based filtering techniques.
  Here we prove that any system without cooperative bonding assembling a unique
mismatch-free terminal assembly can be used to construct a size-separable
system uniquely assembling the same shape. The proof achieves optimal scale
factor and temperature for the size-separable system. As part of the proof, we
obtain two results of independent interest on mismatch-free temperature-1
two-handed systems."
"Generating an exponential decay function with a time constant on the order of
hundreds of milliseconds is a mainstay for neuromorphic circuits. Usually,
either subthreshold circuits or RC-decays based on transconductance amplifiers
are used. In the latter case, transconductances in the 10 pS range are needed.
However, state-of-the-art low-transconductance amplifiers still require too
much circuit area to be applicable in neuromorphic circuits where >100 of these
time constant circuits may be required on a single chip. We present a silicon
verified operational transconductance amplifier that achieves a gm of 5 pS in
only 700 {\mu}m2, a factor of 10-100 less area than current examples. This
allows a high-density integration of time constant circuits in target
appliations such as synaptic learning or as driving circuit for neuromorphic
memristor arrays."
"Recently it has been shown that Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) circuits can
approximate a given single-qubit unitary with an expected number of $T$ gates
of about $1/3$ of what is required by optimal, deterministic, ancilla-free
decompositions over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. In this work, we introduce a
more general and conceptually simpler circuit decomposition method that allows
for synthesis into protocols that probabilistically implement quantum circuits
over several universal gate sets including, but not restricted to, the
Clifford+$T$ gate set. The protocol, which we call Probabilistic Quantum
Circuits with Fallback (PQF), implements a walk on a discrete Markov chain in
which the target unitary is an absorbing state and in which transitions are
induced by multi-qubit unitaries followed by measurements. In contrast to RUS
protocols, the presented PQF protocols terminate after a finite number of
steps. Specifically, we apply our method to the Clifford+$T$, Clifford+$V$, and
Clifford+$\pi/12$ gate sets to achieve decompositions with expected gate counts
of $\log_b(1/\varepsilon)+O(\log(\log(1/\varepsilon)))$, where $b$ is a
quantity related to the expansion property of the underlying universal gate
set."
"We propose to develop a new method of information storage to replace magnetic
hard disk drives and other instruments of secondary/backup data storage. The
proposed method stores petabytes of user-data in a sugar cube (1 cm3), and can
read/write that information at hundreds of megabits/sec. Digital information is
recorded and stored in the form of a long macromolecule consisting of at least
two bases, A and B. (This would be similar to DNA strands constructed from the
four nucleic acids G,C,A,T.) The macromolecules initially enter the system as
blank slates. A macromolecule with, say, 10,000 identical bases in the form of
AAAAA....AAA may be used to record a kilobyte block of user-data (including
modulation and error-correction coding), although, in this blank state, it can
only represent the null sequence 00000....000. Suppose this blank string of A's
is dragged before an atomically-sharp needle of a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM). When electric pulses are applied to the needle in accordance with the
sequence of 0s and 1s of a 1 kB block of user-data, selected A molecules will
be transformed into B molecules (e.g., a fraction of A will be broken off and
discarded). The resulting string now encodes the user-data in the form of
AABABBA...BAB. The same STM needle can subsequently read the recorded
information, as A and B would produce different electric signals when the
strand passes under the needle. The macromolecule now represents a data block
to be stored in a ""parking lot"" within the sugar cube, and later brought to a
read station on demand. Millions of parking spots and thousands of Read/Write
stations may be integrated within the micro-fabricated sugar cube, thus
providing access to petabytes of user-data in a scheme that benefits from the
massive parallelism of thousands of Read/Write stations within the same
three-dimensionally micro-structured device."
"We describe a new efficient algorithm to approximate z-rotations by
ancilla-free Clifford+V circuits, up to a given precision epsilon. Our
algorithm is optimal in the presence of an oracle for integer factoring: it
outputs the shortest Clifford+V circuit solving the given problem instance. In
the absence of such an oracle, our algorithm is still near-optimal, producing
circuits of V-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the V-count of the
third-to-optimal solution. A restricted version of the algorithm approximates
z-rotations in the Pauli+V gate set. Our method is based on previous work by
the author and Selinger on the optimal ancilla-free approximation of
z-rotations using Clifford+T gates and on previous work by Bocharov, Gurevich,
and Svore on the asymptotically optimal ancilla-free approximation of
z-rotations using Clifford+V gates."
"In this paper, a library-based synthesis methodology for reversible circuits
is proposed where a reversible specification is considered as a permutation
comprising a set of cycles. To this end, a pre-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible
function. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be
used as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The
selected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential
representation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library
containing seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle
of length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a
decomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent
factorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions
contain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are
used in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed
based on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.
Then, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the
library. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method
are considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the
library for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs."
"Reversible logic has applications in various research areas including
low-power design and quantum computation. In this paper, a rule-based
optimization approach for reversible circuits is proposed which uses both
negative and positive control Toffoli gates during the optimization. To this
end, a set of rules for removing NOT gates and optimizing sub-circuits with
common-target gates are proposed. To evaluate the proposed approach, the
best-reported synthesized circuits and the results of a recent synthesis
algorithm which uses both negative and positive controls are used. Our
experiments reveal the potential of the proposed approach in optimizing
synthesized circuits."
"Reversible logic has applications in various research areas including signal
processing, cryptography and quantum computation. In this paper, direct
NCT-based synthesis of a given $k$-cycle in a cycle-based synthesis scenario is
examined. To this end, a set of seven building blocks is proposed that reveals
the potential of direct synthesis of a given permutation to reduce both quantum
cost and average runtime. To synthesize a given large cycle, we propose a
decomposition algorithm to extract the suggested building blocks from the input
specification. Then, a synthesis method is introduced which uses the building
blocks and the decomposition algorithm. Finally, a hybrid synthesis framework
is suggested which uses the proposed cycle-based synthesis method in
conjunction with one of the recent NCT-based synthesis approaches which is
based on Reed-Muller (RM) spectra. The time complexity and the effectiveness of
the proposed synthesis approach are analyzed in detail. Our analyses show that
the proposed hybrid framework leads to a better quantum cost in the worst-case
scenario compared to the previously presented methods. The proposed framework
always converges and typically synthesizes a given specification very fast
compared to the available synthesis algorithms. Besides, the quantum costs of
benchmark functions are improved about 20% on average (55% in the best case)."
"For years, the quantum/reversible circuit community has been convinced that:
a) the addition of auxiliary qubits is instrumental in constructing a smaller
quantum circuit; and, b) the introduction of quantum gates inside reversible
circuits may result in more efficient designs. This paper presents a systematic
approach to optimizing reversible (and quantum) circuits via the introduction
of auxiliary qubits and quantum gates inside circuit designs. This advances our
understanding of what may be achieved with a) and b)."
"Optimal synthesis of reversible functions is a non-trivial problem. One of
the major limiting factors in computing such circuits is the sheer number of
reversible functions. Even restricting synthesis to 4-bit reversible functions
results in a huge search space (16! {\approx} 2^{44} functions). The output of
such a search alone, counting only the space required to list Toffoli gates for
every function, would require over 100 terabytes of storage. In this paper, we
present two algorithms: one, that synthesizes an optimal circuit for any 4-bit
reversible specification, and another that synthesizes all optimal
implementations. We employ several techniques to make the problem tractable. We
report results from several experiments, including synthesis of all optimal
4-bit permutations, synthesis of random 4-bit permutations, optimal synthesis
of all 4-bit linear reversible circuits, synthesis of existing benchmark
functions; we compose a list of the hardest permutations to synthesize, and
show distribution of optimal circuits. We further illustrate that our proposed
approach may be extended to accommodate physical constraints via reporting
LNN-optimal reversible circuits. Our results have important implications in the
design and optimization of reversible and quantum circuits, testing circuit
synthesis heuristics, and performing experiments in the area of quantum
information processing."
"Is Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) ""powerful?"" Well, if certain
tiles are required to ""cooperate"" in order to be able to bind to a growing tile
assembly (a.k.a., temperature 2 self-assembly), then Turing universal
computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \times N$ squares is
achievable in the aTAM (Rotemund and Winfree, STOC 2000). So yes, in a
computational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely
removes this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),
then the computational ""power"" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing
universal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \times N$ squares)
becomes unknown. On the plus side, the aTAM, at temperature 1, isn't only
Turing universal but also supports the efficient self-assembly $N \times N$
squares if self-assembly is allowed to utilize three spatial dimensions (Fu,
Schweller and Cook, SODA 2011). We investigate the theoretical ""power"" of a
seemingly simple, restrictive class of tile assembly systems (TASs) in which
(1) the absolute value of every glue strength is 1, (2) there's a single
negative strength glue type and (3) unequal glues can't interact. We call these
the \emph{restricted glue} TASs (rgTAS). We first show the tile complexity of
producing an $N \times N$ square with an rgTAS is $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log
n})$. We also prove that rgTASs are Turing universal with a construction that
simulates an arbitrary Turing machine. Next, we provide results for a variation
of the rgTAS class, partially restricted glue TASs, which is similar except
that the magnitude of the negative glue's strength can only assumed to be $\ge
1$. These results consist of a construction with $O(\log n)$ tile complexity
for building $N \times N$ squares, and one which simulates a Turing machine but
with a greater scaling factor than for the rgTAS construction."
"In this paper, we first describe the isothermal constrained loop extension
DNA amplification (ICLEDA), which is a new variant of amplification combining
the advantages of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and of strand displacement
amplification (SDA). Then, we formalize this process in terms of the theory of
formal languages and show, on the basis of this formulation, how to manage OR
and AND gates. We then explain how to introduce negation, which allows us to
prove that, in principle, it is possible to implement the computation of any
boolean function on DNA strands using ICLEDA."
"In this paper we argue that the set of wireless, mobile devices (e.g.,
portable telephones, tablet PCs, GPS navigators, media players) commonly used
by human users enables the construction of what we term a digital ecosystem,
i.e., an ecosystem constructed out of so-called digital organisms (see below),
that can foster the development of novel distributed services. In this context,
a human user equipped with his/her own mobile devices, can be though of as a
digital organism (DO), a subsystem characterized by a set of peculiar features
and resources it can offer to the rest of the ecosystem for use from its peer
DOs. The internal organization of the DO must address issues of management of
its own resources, including power consumption. Inside the DO and among DOs,
peer-to-peer interaction mechanisms can be conveniently deployed to favor
resource sharing and data dissemination. Throughout this paper, we show that
most of the solutions and technologies needed to construct a digital ecosystem
are already available. What is still missing is a framework (i.e., mechanisms,
protocols, services) that can support effectively the integration and
cooperation of these technologies. In addition, in the following we show that
that framework can be implemented as a middleware subsystem that enables novel
and ubiquitous forms of computation and communication. Finally, in order to
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce some experimental
results we have obtained from preliminary implementations of (parts of) that
subsystem."
"Recently, reversible circuit synthesis has been intensively studied. One of
the problems that has not been solved for a long time was exact minimization of
gate count (GC) in 4-bit circuits. Finally, last year a tool of practical usage
for finding optimal gate count Toffoli networks for any 4-variable function was
developed. However, not much work has been done yet on exact minimization of
quantum cost (QC) in 4-bit circuits. This paper presents an application of the
above mentioned tool to reducing QC of 4-bit reversible circuits. It is shown
that for benchmarks and for designs taken from recent publications it is
possible to obtain savings in QC of up to 74% comparing with previously known
circuits."
"Creating autonomous, self-supporting, self-replicating, sustainable systems
is a great challenge. To some extent, understanding life means not only being
able to create it from scratch, but also improving, supporting, saving it, or
even making it even more advanced. This can be thought of as a long-term goal
of living technologies and embodied evolution. Current research agenda targets
several short- and middle-term steps towards achieving such a vision:
connection of ICT and bio-/chemo- developments, advances in ""soft"" and ""wet""
robotics, integration of material science into developmental robotics, and
potentially, addressing the self-replication in autonomous systems."
"According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors in the
next 10-15 years the limits imposed by the physics of switch operation will be
the major roadblock for future scaling of the CMOS technology. Among these
limits the most fundamental is represented by the so-called Shannon-von
Neumann-Landauer limit that sets a lower bound to the minimum heat dissipated
per bit erasing operation. Here we show that in a nanoscale switch, operated at
finite temperature T, this limit can be beaten by trading the dissipated energy
with the uncertainty in the distinguishability of switch logic states. We
establish a general relation between the minimum required energy and the
maximum error rate in the switch operation and briefly discuss the potential
applications in the design of future switches."
"When a voltage is applied across a thin layer of cholesteric liquid crystal,
fingers of cholesteric alignment can form and propagate in the layer. In
computer simulation, based on experimental laboratory results, we demonstrate
that these cholesteric fingers can solve selected problems of computational
geometry, logic and arithmetics. We show that branching fingers approximate a
planar Voronoi diagram, and non-branching fingers produce a convex subdivision
of concave polygons. We also provide a detailed blue-print and simulation of a
one-bit half-adder functioning on the principles of collision-based computing,
where the implementation is via collision of liquid crystal fingers with
obstacles and other fingers."
"We study two-dimensional cellular automata, each cell takes three states:
resting, excited and refractory. A resting cell excites if number of excited
neighbours lies in a certain interval (excitation interval). An excited cell
become refractory independently on states of its neighbours. A refractory cell
returns to a resting state only if the number of excited neighbours belong to
recovery interval. The model is an excitable cellular automaton abstraction of
a spatially extended semi-memristive medium where a cell's resting state
symbolises low-resistance and refractory state high-resistance. The medium is
semi-memristive because only transition from high- to low-resistance is
controlled by density of local excitation. We present phenomenological
classification of the automata behaviour for all possible excitation intervals
and recovery intervals. We describe eleven classes of cellular automata with
retained refractoriness based on criteria of space-filling ratio, morphological
and generative diversity, and types of travelling localisations."
"Reversible circuits for modular multiplication $Cx$%$M$ with $x<M$ arise as
components of modular exponentiation in Shor's quantum number-factoring
algorithm. However, existing generic constructions focus on asymptotic gate
count and circuit depth rather than actual values, producing fairly large
circuits not optimized for specific $C$ and $M$ values. In this work, we
develop such optimizations in a bottom-up fashion, starting with most
convenient $C$ values. When zero-initialized ancilla registers are available,
we reduce the search for compact circuits to a shortest-path problem. Some of
our modular-multiplication circuits are asymptotically smaller than previous
constructions, but worst-case bounds and average sizes remain $\Theta(n^2)$. In
the context of modular exponentiation, we offer several constant-factor
improvements, as well as an improvement by a constant additive term that is
significant for few-qubit circuits arising in ongoing laboratory experiments
with Shor's algorithm."
"Reservoir Computing is a novel computing paradigm which uses a nonlinear
recurrent dynamical system to carry out information processing. Recent
electronic and optoelectronic Reservoir Computers based on an architecture with
a single nonlinear node and a delay loop have shown performance on standardized
tasks comparable to state-of-the-art digital implementations. Here we report an
all-optical implementation of a Reservoir Computer, made of off-the-shelf
components for optical telecommunications. It uses the saturation of a
semiconductor optical amplifier as nonlinearity. The present work shows that,
within the Reservoir Computing paradigm, all-optical computing with
state-of-the-art performance is possible."
"We introduce an analytical framework to understand the path for scaling
nanophotonic interconnects to meet the energy and footprint requirements of
CMOS global interconnects. We derive the device requirements for sub 100
fJ/cm/bit interconnects including tuning power, serialization-deserialization
energy, optical insertion losses, extinction ratio and bit error rates. Using
CMOS with integrated nanophotonics as an example platform, we derive the
energy/bit, linear and areal bandwidth density of optical interconnects. We
also derive the targets for device performance which indicate the need for
continued improvements in insertion losses (<8dB), laser efficiency,
operational speeds (>40 Gb/s), tuning power (<100 {\mu}W/nm),
serialization-deserialization (< 10 fJ/bit/Operation) and necessity for
spectrally selective devices with wavelength multiplexing (> 6 channels)."
"This volume contains the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on
Developments in Computational Models (DCM 2011) which was held on Sunday July
3, 2011, in Zurich, Switzerland, as a satelite workshop of ICALP 2011.
  Recently several new models of computation have emerged, for instance for
bio-computing and quantum-computing, and in addition traditional models of
computation have been adapted to accommodate new demands or capabilities of
computer systems. The aim of DCM is to bring together researchers who are
currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional
computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum
for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn
about current activities in this area."
"Computational devices combining two or more different parts, one controlling
the operation of the other, for example, derive their power from the
interaction, in addition to the capabilities of the parts. Non-classical
computation has tended to consider only single computational models: neural,
analog, quantum, chemical, biological, neglecting to account for the
contribution from the experimental controls. In this position paper, we propose
a framework suitable for analysing combined computational models, from abstract
theory to practical programming tools. Focusing on the simplest example of one
system controlled by another through a sequence of operations in which only one
system is active at a time, the output from one system becomes the input to the
other for the next step, and vice versa. We outline the categorical machinery
required for handling diverse computational systems in such combinations, with
their interactions explicitly accounted for. Drawing on prior work in
refinement and retrenchment, we suggest an appropriate framework for developing
programming tools from the categorical framework. We place this work in the
context of two contrasting concepts of ""efficiency"": theoretical comparisons to
determine the relative computational power do not always reflect the practical
comparison of real resources for a finite-sized computational task, especially
when the inputs include (approximations of) real numbers. Finally we outline
the limitations of our simple model, and identify some of the extensions that
will be required to treat more complex interacting computational systems."
"Advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) have revolutionized the
digital age to a point where animate and inanimate objects can be used as a
communication channel. In addition, the ubiquity of mobile phones with
increasing capabilities and ample resources means people are now effectively
mobile sensors that can be used to sense the environment as well as data
carriers. These objects, along with their devices, form a new kind of networks
that are characterized by frequent disconnections, resource constraints and
unpredictable or stochastic mobility patterns. A key underpinning in these
networks is routing or data dissemination protocols that are designed
specifically to handle the aforementioned characteristics. Therefore, there is
a need to review state-of-the-art routing protocols, categorize them, and
compare and contrast their approaches in terms of delivery rate, resource
consumption and end-to-end delay. To this end, this paper reviews 63 unicast,
multicast and coding-based routing protocols that are designed specifically to
run in delay tolerant or challenged networks. We provide an extensive
qualitative comparison of all protocols, highlight their experimental setup and
outline their deficiencies in terms of design and research methodology. Apart
from that, we review research that aims to exploit studies on social networks
and epidemiology in order to improve routing protocol performance. Lastly, we
provide a list of future research directions."
"We give a Clifford+T representation of the Toffoli gate of T-depth 1, using
four ancillas. More generally, we describe a class of circuits whose T-depth
can be reduced to 1 by using sufficiently many ancillas. We show that the cost
of adding an additional control to any controlled gate is at most 8 additional
T-gates, and T-depth 2. We also show that the circuit THT does not possess a
T-depth 1 representation with an arbitrary number of ancillas initialized to 0."
"We propose an all spin state element to enable all spin state machines using
spin currents and nanomagnets. We demonstrate via numerical simulations the
operation of a state element a critical building block for synchronous,
sequential logic computation. The numerical models encompass
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) nanomagnet dynamics with stochastic models and
vector spin-transport in metallic magnetic and non-magnetic channels. Combined
with all spin combinatorial logic, the state elements can enable synchronous
and asynchronous computing elements."
"An important task required to build a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum
computer is to efficiently represent an arbitrary single-qubit rotation by
fault-tolerant quantum operations. Traditionally, the method for decomposing a
single-qubit unitary into a discrete set of gates is Solovay-Kitaev
decomposition, which in practice produces a sequence of depth
O(\log^c(1/\epsilon)), where c~3.97 is the state-of-the-art. The proven lower
bound is c=1, however an efficient algorithm that saturates this bound is
unknown. In this paper, we present an alternative to Solovay-Kitaev
decomposition employing state distillation techniques which reduces c to
between 1.12 and 2.27, depending on the setting. For a given single-qubit
rotation, our protocol significantly lowers the length of the approximating
sequence and the number of required resource states (ancillary qubits). In
addition, our protocol is robust to noise in the resource states."
"This paper presents the design consideration and simulation of interpolator
of OSR 128. The proposed structure uses the half band filers & Comb/Sinc
filter. Experimental result shows that proposed interpolator achieves the
design specification, and also has good noise rejection capabilities. The
interpolator accepts the input at 44.1 kHz for applications like CD & DVD
audio. The interpolation filter can be applied to the delta sigma DAC. The
related work is done with the MATLAB & XILINX ISE simulators. The maximum
operating frequency is achieved as 34.584 MHz."
"Memristors have uses as artificial synapses and perform well in this role in
simulations with artificial spiking neurons. Our experiments show that
memristor networks natively spike and can exhibit emergent oscillations and
bursting spikes. Networks of near-ideal memristors exhibit behaviour similar to
a single memristor and combine in circuits like resistors do. Spiking is more
likely when filamentary memristors are used or the circuits have a higher
degree of compositional complexity (i.e. a larger number of anti-series or
anti-parallel interactions). 3-memristor circuits with the same memristor
polarity (low compositional complexity) are stabilised and do not show spiking
behaviour. 3-memristor circuits with anti-series and/or anti-parallel
compositions show richer and more complex dynamics than 2-memristor spiking
circuits. We show that the complexity of these dynamics can be quantified by
calculating (using partial auto-correlation functions) the minimum order
auto-regression function that could fit it. We propose that these oscillations
and spikes may be similar phenomena to brainwaves and neural spike trains and
suggest that these behaviours can be used to perform neuromorphic computation."
"Using Rule 126 elementary cellular automaton (ECA) we demonstrate that a
chaotic discrete system --- when enriched with memory -- hence exhibits complex
dynamics where such space exploits on an ample universe of periodic patterns
induced from original information of the ahistorical system. First we analyse
classic ECA Rule 126 to identify basic characteristics with mean field theory,
basins, and de Bruijn diagrams. In order to derive this complex dynamics, we
use a kind of memory on Rule 126; from here interactions between gliders are
studied for detecting stationary patterns, glider guns and simulating specific
simple computable functions produced by glider collisions."
"We prove that a unitary matrix has an exact representation over the
Clifford+T gate set with local ancillas if and only if its entries are in the
ring Z[1/sqrt(2),i]. Moreover, we show that one ancilla always suffices. These
facts were conjectured by Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca. We obtain an
algorithm for synthesizing a exact Clifford+T circuit from any such n-qubit
operator. We also characterize the Clifford+T operators that can be represented
without ancillas."
"We present an algorithm for building a circuit that approximates single qubit
unitaries with precision {\epsilon} using O(log(1/{\epsilon})) Clifford and T
gates and employing up to two ancillary qubits. The algorithm for computing our
approximating circuit requires an average of O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log
log(1/{\epsilon})) operations. We prove that the number of gates in our circuit
saturates the lower bound on the number of gates required in the scenario when
a constant number of ancillae are supplied, and as such, our circuits are
asymptotically optimal. This results in significant improvement over the
current state of the art for finding an approximation of a unitary, including
the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm that requires O(log^{3+{\delta}}(1/{\epsilon}))
gates and does not use ancillae and the phase kickback approach that requires
O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log log(1/{\epsilon})) gates, but uses
O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})) ancillae."
"We propose that the behaviour of non-linear media can be controlled
automatically through coevolutionary systems. By extension, forms of
unconventional computing, i.e., massively parallel non-linear computers, can be
realised by such an approach. In this study a light-sensitive sub-excitable
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is controlled using various heterogeneous
cellular automata. A checkerboard image comprising of varying light intensity
cells is projected onto the surface of a catalyst-loaded gel resulting in rich
spatio-temporal chemical wave behaviour. The coevolved cellular automata are
shown to be able to control chemical activity through dynamic control of the
light intensity. The approach is demonstrated through the creation of a number
of simple Boolean logic gates."
"Network-on-chip (NoC) is a new aspect for designing of future System-On-Chips
(SoC) where a vast number of IP cores are connected through interconnection
network. The communication between the nodes occurred by routing packets rather
than wires. It supports high degree of scalability, reusability and parallelism
in communication. In this paper, we present a Mesh routing architecture, which
is called Diametrical 2D Mesh of Tree, based on Mesh-of-Tree (MoT) routing and
Diametrical 2D Mesh. It has the advantage of having small diameter as well as
large bisection width and small node degree clubbed with being the fastest
network in terms of speed. The routing algorithm ensures that the packets will
always reach from source to sink through shortest path and is deadlock free."
"Memristors are promising next-generation memory candidates that are
nonvolatile, possess low power requirements and are capable of nanoscale
fabrication. In this article we physically realise and describe the use of
organic memristors in designing statefull boolean logic gates for the AND OR
and NOT operations. The output of these gates is analog and dependent on the
length of time that suitable charge is applied to the inputs, displaying a
learning property. Results may be also interpreted in a traditional binary
manner through use of a suitable thresholding function at the output. The
memristive property of the gate allows the for the production of analog outputs
that vary based on the charge-dependent nonvolatile state of the memristor. We
provide experimental results of physical fabrication of three types of logic
gate. A simulation of a one-bit full adder comprised of memristive logic gates
is also included, displaying varying response to two distinct input patterns."
"This article presents a spiking neuroevolutionary system which implements
memristors as plastic connections, i.e. whose weights can vary during a trial.
The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaptation and variable
topologies, allowing the number of neurons, connection weights, and
inter-neural connectivity pattern to emerge. By comparing two phenomenological
real-world memristor implementations with networks comprised of (i) linear
resistors (ii) constant-valued connections, we demonstrate that this approach
allows the evolution of networks of appropriate complexity to emerge whilst
exploiting the memristive properties of the connections to reduce learning
time. We extend this approach to allow for heterogeneous mixtures of memristors
within the networks; our approach provides an in-depth analysis of network
structure. Our networks are evaluated on simulated robotic navigation tasks;
results demonstrate that memristive plasticity enables higher performance than
constant-weighted connections in both static and dynamic reward scenarios, and
that mixtures of memristive elements provide performance advantages when
compared to homogeneous memristive networks."
"We present an algorithm, along with its implementation that finds T-optimal
approximations of single-qubit Z-rotations using quantum circuits consisting of
Clifford and T gates. Our algorithm is capable of handling errors in
approximation down to size $10^{-15}$, resulting in optimal single-qubit
circuit designs required for implementation of scalable quantum algorithms. Our
implementation along with the experimental results are available in the public
domain."
"Brain-mapping techniques have proven to be vital in understanding the
molecular, cellular, and functional mechanisms of the brain. Normal anatomical
imaging can provide structural information on certain abnormalities in the
brain. However there are many neurological disorders for which only structure
studies are not sufficient. In such cases it is required to investigate the
functional organization of the brain. Further it is necessary to study the
brain functions under normal as well as diseased conditions. Brain mapping
techniques can help in deriving useful and important information on these
issues. Brain functions and brain area responsible for the particular
activities like motor, sensory speech and memory process could be investigated.
The authors provide an overview of various Brain Mapping techniques and fMRI
signal processing methods."
"Phononic computing -- the use of (typically thermal) vibrations for
information processing -- is a nascent technology; its capabilities are still
being discovered. We analyze an alternative form of phononic computing inspired
by optical, rather than electronic, computing. Using the acoustic Faraday
effect, we design a phonon gyrator and thereby a means of performing
computation through the manipulation of polarization in transverse phonon
currents. Moreover, we establish that our gyrators act as generalized
transistors and can construct digital logic gates. Exploiting the wave nature
of phonons and the similarity of our logic gates, we demonstrate parallel
computation within a single circuit, an effect presently unique to phonons.
Finally, a generic method of designing these parallel circuits is introduced
and used to analyze the feasibility of magneto-acoustic materials in realizing
these circuits."
"From the initial 1997 specification to the undergoing IEEE 802.11ac
standardization, a leap in throughput has been observed with every new
generation. The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,
range, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a
challenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of
physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting
exploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied
cross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac
standard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge
between PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in
collision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly
involved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC
mechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such
functionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac
specifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for
the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,
needs both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented
cross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it
with the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate
the 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO
solutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel
sounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a
short PHY layer version of acknowledgment frames for overhead reduction in IEEE
802.11ah communications."
"We illustrate Archimedes' method using models produced with 3D printers. This
approach allowed us to create physical proofs of results known to Archimedes
and illustrate ideas of a mathematician who is known both for his for his
mechanical inventions as well as his breakthroughs in geometry and calculus. We
use technology from the 21st century to trace intellectual achievements from
the 3rd century BC. While we celebrate the 2300th birthday of Archimedes
(287-212 BC) in 2013, we also live in an exciting time, where 3D printing is
becoming popular and affordable."
"Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exploit the intrinsic complexity and
irreproducibility of physical systems to generate secret information. PUFs have
the potential to provide fundamentally higher security than traditional
cryptographic methods by preventing the cloning of identities and the
extraction of secret keys. One unique and exciting opportunity is that of using
the super-high information content (SHIC) capability of nanocrossbar
architecture as well as the high resistance programming variation of resistive
memories to develop a highly secure on-chip PUFs for extremely resource
constrained devices characterized by limited power and area budgets such as
passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices. We show how to implement
PUF based on nano-scale memristive (resistive memory) devices (mrPUF). Our
proposed architecture significantly increased the number of possible
challenge-response pairs (CRPs), while also consuming relatively lesser power
(around 70 uW). The presented approach can be used in other silicon-based PUFs
as well."
"Despite the conclusive potential of cognitive radio for provisioning the
dynamic and flexible spectrum/channel allocation, the research community should
study the performance gain of physical layer over such a radio with cognition
capabilities. To this end, several mechanisms of physical layers such as
adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple output antennas; channel coding
and/or combination of them should be studied. These studies should be
accomplished in terms of spectral efficiency. Therefore, the gain of cognitive
radio in wireless networks available into the market will be identified
practically. Another issue under consideration should be the performance
evaluation of cognitive radio assuming a cross-layer combination between the
cognitive physical and the upper layers. To this direction, this paper presents
a study on spectral efficiency at the physical layer with cognitive
capabilities. In sequel, we study a cross-layer combination of physical layer
with upper layers in the same cognitive context. The performance gain of
cognitive radio in such a physical layer is realized practically as well as a
few cross-layer design issues have been raised."
"A new approach for implementing number of expressions, emotions and, actions
to operate objects through the thoughts of brain using a Non-Invasive Brain
Computing Interface (BCI) technique has been proposed. In this paper a survey
on brain and its operations are presented. The steps involved in the brain
signal processing are discussed. The current systems are able to present few
expressions and emotions on a single device. The proposed system provides the
extended number of expressions on multiple numbers of objects."
"We introduce seven new versions of the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-(like)-Noise
(KLJN) classical physical secure key exchange scheme and a new transient
protocol for practically-perfect security. While these practical improvements
offer progressively enhanced security and/or speed for the non-ideal
conditions, the fundamental physical laws providing the security remain the
same.
  In the ""intelligent"" KLJN (iKLJN) scheme, Alice and Bob utilize the fact that
they exactly know not only their own resistor value but also the stochastic
time function of their own noise, which they generate before feeding it into
the loop.
  In the ""multiple"" KLJN (MKLJN) system, Alice and Bob have publicly known
identical sets of different resistors with a proper, publicly known truth table
about the bit-interpretation of their combination. In the ""keyed"" KLJN (KKLJN)
system, by using secure communication with a formerly shared key, Alice and Bob
share a proper time-dependent truth table for the bit-interpretation of the
resistor situation for each secure bit exchange step during generating the next
key.
  The remaining four KLJN schemes are the combinations of the above protocols
to synergically enhance the security properties. These are: the
""intelligent-multiple"" (iMKLJN), the ""intelligent-keyed"" (iKKLJN), the
""keyed-multiple"" (KMKLJN) and the ""intelligent-keyed-multiple"" (iKMKLJN) KLJN
key exchange systems.
  Finally, we introduce a new transient-protocol offering practically-perfect
security without privacy amplification, which is not needed at practical
applications but it is shown for the sake of ongoing discussions."
"This paper addresses a novel five-transistor (5T) CMOS SRAM design with high
performance and reliability in 65nm CMOS, and illustrates how it reduces the
dynamic power consumption in comparison with the conventional and low-power 6T
SRAM counterparts. This design can be used as cache memory in processors and
low-power portable devices. The proposed SRAM cell features ~13% area reduction
compared to a conventional 6T cell, and features a unique bit-line and negative
supply voltage biasing methodology and ground control architecture to enhance
performance, and suppress standby leakage power."
"Most work in quantum circuit optimization has been performed in isolation
from the results of quantum fault-tolerance. Here we present a polynomial-time
algorithm for optimizing quantum circuits that takes the actual implementation
of fault-tolerant logical gates into consideration. Our algorithm
re-synthesizes quantum circuits composed of Clifford group and T gates, the
latter being typically the most costly gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g.,
those based on the Steane or surface codes, with the purpose of minimizing both
T-count and T-depth. A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to
re-synthesize circuits with additional ancillae to reduce T-depth at
effectively no cost. The tested benchmarks show up to 65.7% reduction in
T-count and up to 87.6% reduction in T-depth without ancillae, or 99.7%
reduction in T-depth using ancillae."
"We design a circuit structure with linear depth to implement an $n$-qubit
Toffoli gate. The proposed construction uses a quadratic-size circuit consists
of elementary 2-qubit controlled-rotation gates around the x axis and uses no
ancilla qubit. Circuit depth remains linear in quantum technologies with
finite-distance interactions between qubits. The suggested construction is
related to the long-standing construction by Barenco et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 52:
3457-3467, 1995, arXiv:quant-ph/9503016), which uses a quadratic-size,
quadratic-depth quantum circuit for an $n$-qubit Toffoli gate."
"The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known and challenging
combinatorial optimisation problem. Its computational intractability has
attracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not
optimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple
unconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a
virtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the
material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles
moving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a
set of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,
and the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it
morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage
process automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all
cities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is
elicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated
datasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean
best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour
length of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an
exact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob
constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and
discuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group
points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially
represented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between
this method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and
suggest possibilities for further improvement."
"Quantum arithmetic circuits have practical applications in various quantum
algorithms. In this paper, we address quantum addition on 2-dimensional
nearest-neighbor architectures based on the work presented by Choi and Van
Meter (JETC 2012). To this end, we propose new circuit structures for some
basic blocks in the adder, and reduce communication overhead by adding
concurrency to consecutive blocks and also by parallel execution of expensive
Toffoli gates. The proposed optimizations reduce total depth from $140\sqrt
n+k_1$ to $92\sqrt n+k_2$ for constants $k_1,k_2$ and affect the computation
fidelity considerably."
"Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is large single cell with intriguingly
smart behaviour. The slime mould shows outstanding abilities to adapt its
protoplasmic network to varying environmental conditions. The slime mould can
solve tasks of computational geometry, image processing, logics and arithmetics
when data are represented by configurations of attractants and repellents. We
attempt to map behavioural patterns of slime onto the cognitive control versus
schizotypy spectrum phase space and thus interpret slime mould's activity in
terms of creativity."
"Energy-efficiency and design-complexity of high-speed on-chip and inter-chip
data-interconnects has emerged as the major bottleneck for high-performance
computing-systems. As a solution, we propose an ultra-low energy interconnect
design-scheme using nano-scale spintorque switches. In the proposed method,
data is transmitted in the form of current-pulses, with amplitude of the order
of few micro-amperes that flows across a small terminal-voltage of less than
50mV. Sub-nanosecond spintorque switching of scaled nano-magnets can be used to
receive and convert such high-speed current-mode signal into binary
voltage-levels using magnetic-tunnel-junction (MTJ), with the help of simple
CMOS inverter. As a result of low-voltage, low-current signaling and minimal
signal-conversion overhead, the proposed technique can facilitate highly
compact and simplified designs for multi-gigahertz inter-chip and on-chip
data-communication links. Such links can achieve more than ~100x higher
energy-efficiency, as compared to state of the art CMOS interconnects."
"Emerging resistive-crossbar memory (RCM) technology can be promising for
computationally-expensive analog pattern-matching tasks. However, the use of
CMOS analog-circuits with RCM would result in large power-consumption and poor
scalability, thereby eschewing the benefits of RCM-based computation. We
propose the use of low-voltage, fast-switching, magneto-metallic spin-neurons
for ultra low-power non-Boolean computing with RCM. We present the design of
analog associative memory for face recognition using RCM, where, substituting
conventional analog circuits with spin-neurons can achieve ~100x lower power.
This makes the proposed design ~1000x more energy-efficient than a 45nm-CMOS
digital ASIC, thereby significantly enhancing the prospects of RCM based
computational hardware."
"Spectrum Scarcity is a global problem across the world. This paper emphasizes
on the fact that a global problem has to be dealt on global basis, not just
locally by applying the principle of global cognitive radio,Global
Opportunistic Remote Spectrum Access. The Future Internet and Internet of
Things literally scare the communication system designer regarding the
available bandwidth and spectrum resources. There is absolutely no scope to
waste or under utilize the available resources. Hence the proposed idea of
Global Cognitive Radio Concept can undoubtedly solve the resource problems in
next Generation Communications."
"We pose a novel cellular network planning problem, considering the use of
renewable energy sources and a fundamentally new concept of energy balancing,
and propose a novel algorithm to solve it. In terms of the network capital and
operational expenditure, we conclude that savings can be made by enriching
cellular infrastructure with energy harvesting sources, in comparison to
traditional deployment methods."
"Nanoscale resistive switching devices (memristive devices or memristors) have
been studied for a number of applications ranging from non-volatile memory,
logic to neuromorphic systems. However a major challenge is to address the
potentially large variations in space and in time in these nanoscale devices.
Here we show that in metal-filament based memristive devices the switching can
be fully stochastic. While individual switching events are random, the
distribution and probability of switching can be well predicted and controlled.
Rather than trying to force high switching probabilities using excessive
voltage or time, the inherent stochastic nature of resistive switching allows
these binary devices to be used as building blocks for novel error-tolerant
computing schemes such as stochastic computing and provide a needed ""analog""
feature in neuromorphic applications. To verify such potential, we demonstrated
memristor-based stochastic bitstreams in both time and space domains, and show
that an array of binary memristors can act as a multi-level ""analog"" device for
neuromorphic applications."
"Learning and logic are fundamental brain functions that make the individual
to adapt to the environment, and such functions are established in human brain
by modulating ionic fluxes in synapses. Nanoscale ionic/electronic devices with
inherent synaptic functions are considered to be essential building blocks for
artificial neural networks. Here, Multi-terminal IZO-based artificial synaptic
transistors gated by fast proton-conducting phosphosilicate electrolytes are
fabricated on glass substrates. Proton in the SiO2 electrolyte and IZO channel
conductance are regarded as the neurotransmitter and synaptic weight,
respectively. Spike-timing dependent plasticity, short-term memory and
long-term memory were successfully mimicked in such protonic/electronic hybrid
artificial synapses. And most importantly, spatiotemporally correlated logic
functions are also mimicked in a simple artificial neural network without any
intentional hard-wire connections due to the naturally proton-related coupling
effect. The oxide-based protonic/electronic hybrid artificial synaptic
transistors reported here are potential building blocks for artificial neural
networks."
"GCD computations and variants of the Euclidean algorithm enjoy broad uses in
both classical and quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose quantum
circuits for GCD computation with $O(n \log n)$ depth with O(n) ancillae. Prior
circuit construction needs $O(n^2)$ running time with O(n) ancillae. The
proposed construction is based on the binary GCD algorithm and it benefits from
log-depth circuits for 1-bit shift, comparison/subtraction, and managing
ancillae. The worst-case gate count remains $O(n^2)$, as in traditional
circuits."
"Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large single cell visible by unaided
eye. It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in foraging for nutrients and
developing an optimal transport network of protoplasmic tubes spanning sources
of nutrients. When placed in an environment with distributed sources of
nutrients the cell 'computes' an optimal graph spanning the nutrients by
growing a network of protoplasmic tubes. P. polycephalum imitates development
of man-made transport networks of a country when configuration of nutrients
represents major urban areas. We employ this feature of the slime mould to
imitate mexican migration to USA. The Mexican migration to USA is the World's
largest migration system. We bio-physically imitate the migration using slime
mould P. polycephalum. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA
we imitated development of migratory routes from Mexico-USA border to ten urban
areas with high concentration of Mexican migrants. From results of laboratory
experiments we extracted topologies of migratory routes, and highlighted a role
of elevations in shaping the human movement networks."
"We study optimal synthesis of Clifford circuits, and apply the results to
peep-hole optimization of quantum circuits. We report optimal circuits for all
Clifford operations with up to four inputs. We perform peep-hole optimization
of Clifford circuits with up to 40 inputs found in the literature, and
demonstrate the reduction in the number of gates by about 50%. We extend our
methods to the optimal synthesis of linear reversible circuits, partially
specified Clifford functions, and optimal Clifford circuits with five inputs up
to input/output permutation. The results find their application in randomized
benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit
optimization."
"A method to quantify the error probability at the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise
(KLJN) secure key exchange is introduced. The types of errors due to
statistical inaccuracies in noise voltage measurements are classified and the
error probability is calculated. The most interesting finding is that the error
probability decays exponentially with the duration of the time window of single
bit exchange. The results indicate that it is feasible to have so small error
probabilities of the exchanged bits that error correction algorithms are not
required. The results are demonstrated with practical considerations."
"The paper attempts to find numerical solutions of Diophantine equations, a
challenging problem as there are no general methods to find solutions of such
equations. It uses the metaphor of foraging habits of real ants. The ant colony
optimization based procedure starts with randomly assigned locations to a fixed
number of artificial ants. Depending upon the quality of these positions, ants
deposit pheromone at the nodes. A successor node is selected from the
topological neighborhood of each of the nodes based on this stochastic
pheromone deposit. If an ant bumps into an already encountered node, the
pheromone is updated correspondingly. A suitably defined pheromone evaporation
strategy guarantees that premature convergence does not take place. The
experimental results, which compares with those of other machine intelligence
techniques, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"Many universal reversible libraries that contain more than one gate type have
been proposed in the literature. Practical implementation of reversible
circuits is much easier if a single gate type is used in the circuit
construction. This paper proposes a reversible n-bit gate that is universal for
reversible circuits synthesis. The proposed gate is extendable according to the
size of the circuit. The paper shows that the size of the synthesized circuits
using the proposed gate is comparable with the size of the synthesized circuits
using the hybrid reversible libraries for 3-in/out reversible circuits."
"Implementing large-scale quantum circuits is one of the challenges of quantum
computing. One of the central challenges of accurately modeling the
architecture of these circuits is to schedule a quantum application and
generate the layout while taking into account the cost of communications and
classical resources as well as the maximum exploitable parallelism. In this
paper, we present and evaluate a design flow for arbitrary quantum circuits in
ion trap technology. Our design flow consists of two parts. First, a scheduler
takes a description of a circuit and finds the best order for the execution of
its quantum gates using integer linear programming (ILP) regarding the
classical resources (qubits) and instruction dependencies. Then a layout
generator receives the schedule produced by the scheduler and generates a
layout for this circuit using a graph-drawing algorithm. Our experimental
results show that the proposed flow decreases the average latency of quantum
circuits by about 11% for a set of attempted benchmarks and by about 9% for
another set of benchmarks compared with the best in literature."
"Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a large single cell visible by unaided
eye. We design a slime mould implementation of a tactile hair, where the slime
mould responds to repeated deflection of hair by an immediate high-amplitude
spike and a prolonged increase in amplitude and width of its oscillation
impulses. We demonstrate that signal-to-noise ratio of the Physarum tactile
hair sensor averages near six for the immediate response and two for the
prolonged response."
"We describe a new method for approximating an arbitrary $n$ qubit unitary
with precision $\varepsilon$ using a Clifford and T circuit with
$O(4^{n}n(\log(1/\varepsilon)+n))$ gates. The method is based on rounding off a
unitary to a unitary over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i,1/\sqrt{2}]$ and employing
exact synthesis. We also show that any $n$ qubit unitary over the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[i,1/\sqrt{2}]$ with entries of the form
$(a+b\sqrt{2}+ic+id\sqrt{2})/2^{k}$ can be exactly synthesized using
$O(4^{n}nk)$ Clifford and T gates using two ancillary qubits. This new exact
synthesis algorithm is an improvement over the best known exact synthesis
method by B. Giles and P. Selinger requiring $O(3^{2^{n}}nk)$ elementary gates."
"Blind quantum computation is an appealing use of quantum information
technology because it can conceal both the client's data and the algorithm
itself from the server. However, problems need to be solved in the practical
use of blind quantum computation and fault-tolerance is a major challenge. On
an example circuit, the computational cost measured in T gates executed by the
client is 97 times more than performing the original computation directly,
without using the server, even before applying error correction. (The client
still benefits due to drastically reduced memory requirements.) Broadbent et
al. proposed running error correction over blind computation, but our first
protocol applies one layer of Steane's [[7,1,3]] code underneath instead. This
protocol has better fault tolerance, but still results in a substantial
overhead. We propose another protocol to reduce the client's computational load
by transferring the qubit preparation to the server. For each logical qubit
used in the computation, the client is only required to receive eight logical
qubits via teleportation then buffer two logical qubits before returning one.
This protocol also protects the client's fault-tolerant preparation of logical
qubits from a side-channel attack."
"Reversible logic has applications in low-power computing and quantum
computing. However, there are few existing designs for reversible
floating-point adders and none suitable for quantum computation. In this paper
we propose a space-efficient reversible floating-point adder, suitable for
binary quantum computation, improving the design of Nachtigal et al. Our work
focuses on improving the reversible designs of the alignment unit and the
normalization unit, which are the most expensive parts. By changing a few
elements of the existing algorithm, including the circuit designs of the RLZC
(reversible leading zero counter) and converter, we have reduced the cost about
68%. We also propose fault-tolerant designs for the circuits. The KQ for our
fault-tolerant design is almost sixty times as expensive as for a 32-bit
fixed-point addition. We note that the floating-point representation makes
in-place, truly reversible arithmetic impossible, requiring us to retain both
inputs, which limits the sustainability of its use for quantum computation."
"We report a resistance based threshold logic family useful for mimicking
brain like large variable logic functions in VLSI. A universal Boolean logic
cell based on an analog resistive divider and threshold logic circuit is
presented. The resistive divider is implemented using memristors and provides
output voltage as a summation of weighted product of input voltages. The output
of resistive divider is converted into a binary value by a threshold operation
implemented by CMOS inverter and/or Opamp. An universal cell structure is
presented to decrease the overall implementation complexity and number of
components. When the number of input variables become very high, the proposed
cell offers advantages of smaller area and design simplicity in comparison with
CMOS based logic circuits."
"Making a reversible circuit fault-tolerant is much more difficult than
classical circuit and there have been only a few works in the area of
parity-preserving reversible logic design. Moreover, all of these designs are
ad hoc, based on some pre-defined parity preserving reversible gates as
building blocks. In this paper, we for the first time propose a novel and
systematic approach towards parity preserving reversible circuits design. We
provide some related theoretical results and give two algorithms, one from
reversible specification to parity preserving reversible specification and
another from irreversible specification to parity preserving reversible
specification. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by extensive
experimental results."
"Nowadays, cognitive radio is one of the most promising paradigms in the arena
of wireless communications, as it aims at the proficient use of radio
resources. Proper utilization of the radio spectrum requires dynamic spectrum
accessing. To this end, spectrum sensing is undoubtedly necessary. In this
chapter, various approaches for dynamic spectrum access scheme are presented,
together with a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio.
Moreover, the challenges are analyzed that are associated with spectrum sensing
and dynamic spectrum access techniques. Sensing beacon transmitted from
different cognitive terminals creates significant interference to the primary
users if proper precautions have not be not taken into consideration.
Consequently, cognitive radio transmitter power control will be finally
addressed to analyze energy efficiency aspects."
"The Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 complex Hermitian, unitary
matrices. In this article, we investigate the relationships between certain
roots of the Pauli matrices and how gates implementing those roots are used in
quantum circuits. Techniques for simplifying such circuits are given. In
particular, we show how those techniques can be used to find a circuit of
Clifford+T gates starting from a circuit composed of gates from the well
studied NCV library."
"In this paper we discuss the potential of emerging spintorque devices for
computing applications. Recent proposals for spinbased computing schemes may be
differentiated as all-spin vs. hybrid, programmable vs. fixed, and, Boolean vs.
non-Boolean. All spin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small
form-factor of nano-magnetic devices. However, circuit and system-level design
techniques need to be explored that leverage the specific spin-device
characteristics to achieve energy-efficiency, performance and reliability
comparable to those of CMOS. The non-volatility of nanomagnets can be exploited
in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic. In such
logic-styles, spin-devices may play the dual-role of computing as well as
memory-elements that provide field-programmability. Spin-based threshold logic
design is presented as an example (dynamic resisitve threshold logic and
magnetic threshold logic). Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultralow-
voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing
capabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for
non-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing.
Integration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and
resistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing
hardware for applications like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing,
image-processing and data-conversion. Towards the end, we discuss the
possibility of applying emerging spin-torque switches in the design of
energy-efficient global interconnects, for future chip multiprocessors."
"The biological immune system is a robust, complex, adaptive system that
defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or
molecules) within the body as self or non-self substances. It does this with
the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action
from a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical
messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune
system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and
destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds
to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can
remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information
processing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in
recent years.
  A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by immunology, has
emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts from the immune
system have been extracted and applied for solution to real world science and
engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the immune system
metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems methods. We
will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for Artificial Immune
Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one such problem. A
comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known algorithms,
areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will round this
tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems is still a
young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm template and hence
actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to time and from those
examples given here."
"Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless
networks in order to efficiently utilize the limited spectrum resources and
satisfy the rapidly increasing demand for wireless applications and services.
Security is a very important but not well addressed issue in CR networks. In
this paper we focus on security problems arising from Primary User Emulation
(PUE) attacks in CR networks. We present a comprehensive introduction to PUE
attacks, from the attacking rationale and its impact on CR networks, to
detection and defense approaches. In order to secure CR networks against PUE
attacks, a two-level database-assisted detection approach is proposed to detect
such attacks. Energy detection and location verification are combined for fast
and reliable detection. An admission control based defense approach is proposed
to mitigate the performance degradation of a CR network under a PUE attack.
Illustrative results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed detection and defense approaches."
"The plasmodium of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum has recently received
significant attention for its value as a highly malleable amorphous computing
substrate. In laboratory-based experiments, micro- and nanoscale artificial
circuit components were introduced into the P. polycephalum plasmdodium to
investigate the electrical properties and computational abilities of hybridised
slime mould. It was found through a combination of imaging techniques and
electrophysiological measurements that P. polycephalum is able to internalise a
range of electrically active nanoparticles, assemble them in vivo and
distribute them around the plasmodium. Hybridised plasmodium is able to form
biomorphic mineralised networks, both inside the living plasmodium and the
empty trails left in its wake by taxis, both of which facilitate the
transmission of electricity. Hybridisation also alters the bioelectrical
activity of the plasmodium and likely influences its information processing
capabilities. It was concluded that hybridised slime mould is a suitable
substrate for producing functional unconventional computing devices."
"Cellular automata (CA) play an important role in the development of
computationally efficient microscopic traffic models and recently have gained
considerable importance as a mean of optimising traffic control strategies.
However, real-time application of the available CA models in traffic control
systems is a difficult task due to their discrete and stochastic nature. This
paper introduces a novel method for simulation of signalised traffic streams,
which combines CA and fuzzy numbers. The introduced traffic simulation
algorithm eliminates main drawbacks of the CA approach, i.e. necessity of
multiple Monte Carlo simulations and calibration issues. Computational cost of
traffic simulation for the proposed algorithm is considerably lower than the
cost of simulation based on stochastic CA. Thus, the simulation results can be
obtained in a much shorter time. Experiments confirmed that the simulation
results for the introduced algorithm are consistent with that observed for
stochastic CA. The proposed simulation algorithm is suitable for real-time
applications in traffic control systems."
"Farhi and others have introduced the notion of solving NP problems using
adiabatic quantum com- puters. We discuss an application of this idea to the
problem of integer factorization, together with a technique we call gluing
which can be used to build adiabatic models of interesting problems. Although
adiabatic quantum computers already exist, they are likely to be too small to
directly tackle problems of interesting practical sizes for the foreseeable
future. Therefore, we discuss techniques for decomposition of large problems,
which permits us to fully exploit such hardware as may be available. Numerical
re- sults suggest that even simple decomposition techniques may yield
acceptable results with subexponential overhead, independent of the performance
of the underlying device."
"Matsumoto and Amano (2008) showed that every single-qubit Clifford+T operator
can be uniquely written of a particular form, which we call the Matsumoto-Amano
normal form. In this mostly expository paper, we give a detailed and
streamlined presentation of Matsumoto and Amano's results, simplifying some
proofs along the way. We also point out some corollaries to Matsumoto and
Amano's work, including an intrinsic characterization of the Clifford+T
subgroup of SO(3), which also yields an efficient T-optimal exact single-qubit
synthesis algorithm. Interestingly, this also gives an alternative proof of
Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca's exact synthesis result for the Clifford+T
subgroup of U(2)."
"Reversible logic has become immensely popular research area and its
applications have spread in various technologies for their low power
consumption. In this paper we proposed an efficient design of random access
memory using reversible logic. In the way of designing the reversible random
access memory we proposed a reversible decoder and a write enable reversible
master slave D flip-flop. All the reversible designs are superior in terms of
quantum cost, delay and garbage outputs compared to the designs existing in
literature."
"Reversible logic is gaining interest of many researchers due to its low power
dissipating characteristic. In this paper we proposed a new approach for
designing online testable reversible circuits. The resultant testable
reversible circuit can detect any single bit error whiles it is operating.
Appropriate theorems and lemmas are presented to clarify the proposed design.
The experimental results show that our design approach is superior in terms of
number of number of gates, garbage outputs and quantum cost."
"A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs weighted sum of multiple inputs and
compares the sum with a threshold. We propose Spin-Memeristor Threshold Logic
(SMTL) gates, which employ memristive cross-bar array (MCA) to perform
current-mode summation of binary inputs, whereas, the low-voltage
fast-switching spintronic threshold devices (STD) carry out the threshold
operation in an energy efficient manner. Field programmable SMTL gate arrays
can operate at a small terminal voltage of ~50mV, resulting in ultra-low power
consumption in gates as well as programmable interconnect networks. We evaluate
the performance of SMTL using threshold logic synthesis. Results for common
benchmarks show that SMTL based programmable logic hardware can be more than
100x energy efficient than state of the art CMOS FPGA."
"Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) tries to mimic the computing in
cerebral-neocortex. It identifies spatial and temporal patterns in the input
for making inferences. This may require large number of computationally
expensive tasks like, dot-product evaluations. Nano-devices that can provide
direct mapping for such primitives are of great interest. In this work we show
that the computing blocks for HTM can be mapped using low-voltage,
fast-switching, magneto-metallic spin-neurons combined with emerging resistive
cross-bar network (RCN). Results show possibility of more than 200x lower
energy as compared to 45nm CMOS ASIC design"
"By using the memristor's memory to both store a bit and perform an operation
with a second input bit, simple Boolean logic gates have been built with a
single memristor. The operation makes use of the interaction of current spikes
(occasionally called current transients) found in both memristors and other
devices. The sequential time-based logic methodology allows two logical input
bits to be used on a one-port by sending the bits separated in time. The
resulting logic gate is faster than one relying on memristor's state switching,
low power and requires only one memristor. We experimentally demonstrate
working OR and XOR gates made with a single flexible Titanium dioxide sol-gel
memristor."
"We consider the problem of approximating arbitrary single-qubit z-rotations
by ancilla-free Clifford+T circuits, up to given epsilon. We present a fast new
probabilistic algorithm for solving this problem optimally, i.e., for finding
the shortest possible circuit whatsoever for the given problem instance. The
algorithm requires a factoring oracle (such as a quantum computer). Even in the
absence of a factoring oracle, the algorithm is still near-optimal under a mild
number-theoretic hypothesis. In this case, the algorithm finds a solution of
T-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the T-count of the
second-to-optimal solution. In the typical case, this yields circuit
approximations of T-count 3log_2(1/epsilon) + O(log(log(1/epsilon))). Our
algorithm is efficient in practice, and provably efficient under the
above-mentioned number-theoretic hypothesis, in the sense that its expected
runtime is O(polylog(1/epsilon))."
"Several analog and digital brain-inspired electronic systems have been
recently proposed as dedicated solutions for fast simulations of spiking neural
networks. While these architectures are useful for exploring the computational
properties of large-scale models of the nervous system, the challenge of
building low-power compact physical artifacts that can behave intelligently in
the real-world and exhibit cognitive abilities still remains open. In this
paper we propose a set of neuromorphic engineering solutions to address this
challenge. In particular, we review neuromorphic circuits for emulating neural
and synaptic dynamics in real-time and discuss the role of biophysically
realistic temporal dynamics in hardware neural processing architectures; we
review the challenges of realizing spike-based plasticity mechanisms in real
physical systems and present examples of analog electronic circuits that
implement them; we describe the computational properties of recurrent neural
networks and show how neuromorphic Winner-Take-All circuits can implement
working-memory and decision-making mechanisms. We validate the neuromorphic
approach proposed with experimental results obtained from our own circuits and
systems, and argue how the circuits and networks presented in this work
represent a useful set of components for efficiently and elegantly implementing
neuromorphic cognition."
"We construct electronic oscillator from acellular slime mould Physarum
polycephalum. The slime mould oscillator is made of two electrodes connected by
a protoplasmic tube of the living slime mould. A protoplasmic tube has an
average resistance of 3~MOhm. The tube's resistance is changing over time due
to peristaltic contractile activity of the tube. The resistance of the
protoplasmic tube oscillates with average period of 73~sec and average
amplitude of 0.6~MOhm. We present experimental laboratory results on dynamics
of Physarum oscillator under direct current voltage up to 15~V and speculate
that slime mould P. polycephalum can be employed as a living electrical
oscillator in biological and hybrid circuits."
"An area of interest in the modern age is the human migration from rural areas
to cities. Cities are characterized by a dense concentration of buildings and
key infrastructures. However, what has been lacking is a pervasive sensor
technology that can monitor the performance of these structures. Partly, this
is due to the fact that the information collected from sensors cannot be easily
transported from the embedded location to an external data hub. Examples of
health monitoring in structures include monitoring corrosion, fracture stress,
and material delamination. The scenario examples include: pipelines, tunnel
networks, and some industrial and medical areas such as hospitals (minimise
electromagnetic interference), and turbines."
"Recently, Gunn, Allison and Abbott (GAA)
[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2709v2.pdf] proposed a new scheme to utilize
electromagnetic waves for eavesdropping on the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise
(KLJN) secure key distribution. We proved in a former paper [Fluct. Noise Lett.
13 (2014) 1450016] that GAA's mathematical model is unphysical. Here we analyze
GAA's cracking scheme and show that, in the case of a loss-free cable, it
provides less eavesdropping information than in the earlier
(Bergou)-Scheuer-Yariv mean-square-based attack [Kish LB, Scheuer J, Phys.
Lett. A 374 (2010) 2140-2142], while it offers no information in the case of a
lossy cable. We also investigate GAA's claim to be experimentally capable of
distinguishing - using statistics over a few correlation times only - the
distributions of two Gaussian noises with a relative variance difference of
less than 10^-8. Normally such distinctions would require hundreds of millions
of correlations times to be observable. We identify several potential
experimental artifacts as results of poor KLJN design, which can lead to GAA's
assertions: deterministic currents due to spurious harmonic components caused
by ground loops, DC offset, aliasing, non-Gaussian features including
non-linearities and other non-idealities in generators, and the time-derivative
nature of GAA's scheme which tends to enhance all of these artifacts."
"Quantum logic decomposition refers to decomposing a given quantum gate to a
set of physically implementable gates. An approach has been presented to
decompose arbitrary diagonal quantum gates to a set of multiplexed-rotation
gates around z axis. In this paper, a special class of diagonal quantum gates,
namely diagonal Hermitian quantum gates, is considered and a new perspective to
the decomposition problem with respect to decomposing these gates is presented.
It is first shown that these gates can be decomposed to a set that solely
consists of multiple-controlled Z gates. Then a binary representation for the
diagonal Hermitian gates is introduced. It is shown that the binary
representations of multiple-controlled Z gates form a basis for the vector
space that is produced by the binary representations of all diagonal Hermitian
quantum gates. Moreover, the problem of decomposing a given diagonal Hermitian
gate is mapped to the problem of writing its binary representation in the
specific basis mentioned above. Moreover, CZ gate is suggested to be the
two-qubit gate in the decomposition library, instead of previously used CNOT
gate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can lead to circuits
with lower costs in comparison with the previous ones."
"We discuss extended definitions of linear and multilinear operations such as
Kronecker, Hadamard, and contracted products, and establish links between them
for tensor calculus. Then we introduce effective low-rank tensor approximation
techniques including Candecomp/Parafac (CP), Tucker, and tensor train (TT)
decompositions with a number of mathematical and graphical representations. We
also provide a brief review of mathematical properties of the TT decomposition
as a low-rank approximation technique. With the aim of breaking the
curse-of-dimensionality in large-scale numerical analysis, we describe basic
operations on large-scale vectors, matrices, and high-order tensors represented
by TT decomposition. The proposed representations can be used for describing
numerical methods based on TT decomposition for solving large-scale
optimization problems such as systems of linear equations and symmetric
eigenvalue problems."
"In this paper, we present a communication protocol between a pair of
biological nanomachines, transmitter and receiver, built upon molecular
communications in an aqueous environment. In our proposal, the receiver, acting
as a control node, sends a connection setup signal to the transmitter, which
stokes molecules, to start molecule transmission. The molecules transmitted by
the transmitter propagate in the environment and are absorbed by the receiver
through its receptors. When the receiver absorbs the desired quantity of
molecules, it releases a tear-down signal to notify the transmitter to stop the
transmission. The proposed protocol implements a bidirectional communication by
using a number of techniques originally designed for the TCP. In fact, the
proposed protocol is connection-oriented, and uses the TCP-like probing to find
a suitable transmission rate between transmitter and receiver so as to avoid
receiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not
used, since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large
delay, a characteristic feature of molecular communications. Thus, the proposed
protocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the
receiver to throttle the transmission rate at the transmitter, i.e., explicit
negative feedbacks. We also present the results of an extensive simulation
campaign, used to validate the proposed protocol and to properly dimension the
main protocol parameters."
"Reversible single-target gates are a generalization of Toffoli gates which
are a helpful formal representation for the description of synthesis algorithms
but are too general for an actual implementation based on some technology.
There is an exponential lower bound on the number of Toffoli gates required to
implement any reversible function, however, there is also a linear upper bound
on the number of single-target gates which can be proven using a constructive
proof based on a former presented synthesis algorithm. Since single-target
gates can be mapped to a cascade of Toffoli gates, this synthesis algorithm
provides an interesting framework for reversible circuit complexity. The paper
motivates this framework and illustrates first possible applications based on
it."
"Nanoscale integrated photonic devices and circuits offer a path to ultra-low
power computation at the few-photon level. Here we propose an optical circuit
that performs a ubiquitous operation: the controlled, random-access readout of
a collection of stored memory phases or, equivalently, the computation of the
inner product of a vector of phases with a binary ""selector"" vector, where the
arithmetic is done modulo 2pi and the result is encoded in the phase of a
coherent field. This circuit, a collection of cascaded interferometers driven
by a coherent input field, demonstrates the use of coherence as a computational
resource, and of the use of recently-developed mathematical tools for modeling
optical circuits with many coupled parts. The construction extends in a
straightforward way to the computation of matrix-vector and matrix-matrix
products, and, with the inclusion of an optical feedback loop, to the
computation of a ""weighted"" readout of stored memory phases. We note some
applications of these circuits for error correction and for computing tasks
requiring fast vector inner products, e.g. statistical classification and some
machine learning algorithms."
"RF sensor networks are used to localize people indoor without requiring them
to wear invasive electronic devices. These wireless mesh networks, formed by
low-power radio transceivers, continuously measure the received signal strength
(RSS) of the links. Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) is a technique that
generates 2D images of the change in the electromagnetic field inside the area
covered by the radio transceivers to spot the presence and movements of
animates (e.g., people, large animals) or large metallic objects (e.g., cars).
Here, we present a RTI system for localizing and tracking people outdoors.
Differently than in indoor environments where the RSS does not change
significantly with time unless people are found in the monitored area, the
outdoor RSS signal is time-variant, e.g., due to rainfalls or wind-driven
foliage. We present a novel outdoor RTI method that, despite the nonstationary
noise introduced in the RSS data by the environment, achieves high localization
accuracy and dramatically reduces the energy consumption of the sensing units.
Experimental results demonstrate that the system accurately detects and tracks
a person in real-time in a large forested area under varying environmental
conditions, significantly reducing false positives, localization error and
energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art RTI methods."
"We study the performance of infotaxis search strategy measured by the rate of
success and mean search time, under changes in the environment parameters such
as diffusivity, rate of emission or wind velocity. We also investigate the drop
of performance caused by an innacurate modelling of the environment. Our
findings show that infotaxis remains robust as long as the estimated parameters
fall within a certain range around their true values, but the success rate
quickly drops making infotaxis no longer feasible if the searcher agent
severely underestimates or overestimates the real environment parameters. This
study places some limits on the performance of infotaxis, and thus it has
practical consequences for the design of infotaxis based machines to track and
detect an emitting source of chemicals or volatile substances."
"AHaH computing forms a theoretical framework from which a
biologically-inspired type of computing architecture can be built where, unlike
von Neumann systems, memory and processor are physically combined. In this
paper we report on an incremental step beyond the theoretical framework of AHaH
computing toward the development of a memristor-based physical neural
processing unit (NPU), which we call Thermodynamic-RAM (kT-RAM). While the
power consumption and speed dominance of such an NPU over von Neumann
architectures for machine learning applications is well appreciated,
Thermodynamic-RAM offers several advantages over other hardware approaches to
adaptation and learning. Benefits include general-purpose use, a simple yet
flexible instruction set and easy integration into existing digital platforms.
We present a high level design of kT-RAM and a formal definition of its
instruction set. We report the completion of a kT-RAM emulator and the
successful port of all previous machine learning benchmark applications
including unsupervised clustering, supervised and unsupervised classification,
complex signal prediction, unsupervised robotic actuation and combinatorial
optimization. Lastly, we extend a previous MNIST hand written digits benchmark
application, to show that an extra step of reading the synaptic states of AHaH
nodes during the train phase (healing) alone results in plasticity that
improves the classifier's performance, bumping our best F1 score up to 99.5%."
"Actin is a globular protein which forms long filaments in the eukaryotic
cytoskeleton, whose roles in cell function include structural support,
contractile activity to intracellular signalling. We model actin filaments as
two chains of one-dimensional binary-state semi-totalistic automaton arrays to
describe hypothetical signalling events therein. Each node of the actin
automaton takes state `0' (resting) or `1' (excited) and updates its state in
discrete time depending on its neighbour's states. We analyse the complete rule
space of actin automata using integral characteristics of space-time
configurations generated by these rules and compute state transition rules that
support travelling and mobile localizations. Approaches towards selection of
the localisation supporting rules using the global characteristics are
outlined. We find that some properties of actin automata rules may be predicted
using Shannon entropy, activity and incoherence of excitation between the
polymer chains. We also show that it is possible to infer whether a given rule
supports travelling or stationary localizations by looking at ratios of excited
neighbours are essential for generations of the localizations. We conclude by
applying biomolecular hypotheses to this model and discuss the significance of
our findings in context with cell signalling and emergent behaviour in cellular
computation."
"An indispensable part of our lives, computing has also become essential to
industries and governments. Steady improvements in computer hardware have been
supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits
over the last fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires increasingly heroic
efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy.
To help evaluate emerging technologies and enrich our understanding of
integrated-circuit scaling, we review fundamental limits to computation: in
manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and
algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, we
recall how some limits were circumvented, compare loose and tight limits. We
also point out that engineering difficulties encountered by emerging
technologies may indicate yet-unknown limits."
"The synthesis of reversible functions has been an intensively studied
research area in the last decade. Since almost all proposed approaches rely on
representations of exponential size (such as truth tables and permutations),
they cannot be applied efficiently to reversible functions with more than 15
variables.
  In this paper, we propose an ancilla-free synthesis approach based on Young
subgroups using symbolic function representations that can efficiently be
implemented with binary decision diagrams (BDDs). As a result, the algorithm
not only allows to synthesize large reversible functions without adding extra
lines, called ancilla, but also leads to significantly smaller circuits
compared to existing approaches."
"This paper deals with the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) classical
statistical physical key exchange method and surveys criticism - often stemming
from a lack of understanding of its underlying premises or from other errors -
and our related responses against these, often unphysical, claims. Some of the
attacks are valid, however, an extended KLJN system remains protected against
all of them, implying that its unconditional security is not impacted."
"Neural spikes in the brain form stochastic sequences, i.e., belong to the
class of pulse noises. This stochasticity is a counterintuitive feature because
extracting information - such as the commonly supposed neural information of
mean spike frequency - requires long times for reasonably low error
probability. The mystery could be solved by noise-based logic, wherein
randomness has an important function and allows large speed enhancements for
special-purpose tasks, and the same mechanism is at work for the brain logic
version of this concept."
"We describe a new method for the decomposition of an arbitrary $n$ qubit
operator with entries in $\mathbb{Z}[i,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$, i.e., of the form
$(a+b\sqrt{2}+i(c+d\sqrt{2}))/{\sqrt{2}^{k}}$, into Clifford+$T$ operators
where $n\le 2$. This method achieves a bound of $O(k)$ gates using at most one
ancilla using decomposition into $1$- and $2$-level matrices which was first
proposed by Giles and Selinger."
"A general scheme to realize a perceptron for hardware neural networks is
presented, where multiple interconnections are achieved by a superposition of
Schrodinger waves. Spatially patterned potentials process information by
coupling different points of reciprocal space. The necessary potential shape is
obtained from the Hebbian learning rule, either through exact calculation or
construction from a superposition of known optical inputs. This allows
implementation in a wide range of compact optical systems, including: 1) any
non-linear optical system; 2) optical systems patterned by optical lithography;
and 3) exciton-polariton systems with phonon or nuclear spin interactions."
"The sophisticated tools and techniques employed by Nature for purposeful
storage of information stand in stark contrast to the primitive and relatively
inefficient means used by man. We describe some impressive features of
biological data storage, and speculate on approaches to research and
development that could benefit the storage industry in the coming decades."
"Optical interconnect has emerged as the front-runner to replace electrical
interconnect especially for off-chip communication. However, a major drawback
with optical interconnects is the need for photodetectors and amplifiers at the
receiver, implemented usually by direct bandgap semiconductors and analog CMOS
circuits, leading to large energy consumption and slow operating time. In this
article, we propose a new optical interconnect architecture that uses a
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) at the receiver side that is switched by
femtosecond laser pulses. The state of the MTJ can be sensed using simple
digital CMOS latches, resulting in significant improvement in energy
consumption. Moreover, magnetization in the MTJ can be switched on the
picoseconds time-scale and our design can operate at a speed of 5 Gbits/sec for
a single link."
"We have modified a commercial NOR flash memory array to enable high-precision
tuning of individual floating-gate cells for analog computing applications. The
modified array area per cell in a 180 nm process is about 1.5 um^2. While this
area is approximately twice the original cell size, it is still at least an
order of magnitude smaller than in the state-of-the-art analog circuit
implementations. The new memory cell arrays have been successfully tested, in
particular confirming that each cell may be automatically tuned, with ~1%
precision, to any desired subthreshold readout current value within an almost
three-orders-of-magnitude dynamic range, even using an unoptimized tuning
algorithm. Preliminary results for a four-quadrant vector-by-matrix multiplier,
implemented with the modified memory array gate-coupled with additional
peripheral floating-gate transistors, show highly linear transfer
characteristics over a broad range of input currents."
"In previous works, hexagonal cellular automata (CA) have been studied as a
variation of the famous Game of Life CA, mainly for spiral phenomena
simulations; where the most interesting constructions are related to the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. In this paper, we analyse a special kind of
hexagonal CA, {\it Spiral rule}. Such automaton shows a non-trivial complex
behaviour related to discrete models of reaction-diffusion chemical media,
dominated by spiral guns which easily emerge from random initial conditions.
The computing capabilities of this automaton are shown by means of logic gates.
These are defined by collisions between mobile localizations. Also, an extended
classification of complex self-localisation patterns is presented, including
some self-organised patterns."
"Working in a three-dimensional variant of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly
Model, we show that, for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a tile set that
uniquely self-assembles into an $N \times N$ square shape at temperature 1 with
optimal program-size complexity of $O(\log N / \log \log N)$ (the program-size
complexity, also known as tile complexity, of a shape is the minimum number of
unique tile types required to uniquely self-assemble it). Moreover, our
construction is ""just barely"" 3D in the sense that it works even when the
placement of tiles is restricted to the $z = 0$ and $z = 1$ planes. This result
affirmatively answers an open question from Cook, Fu, Schweller (SODA 2011). To
achieve this result, we develop a general 3D temperature 1 optimal encoding
construction, reminiscent of the 2D temperature 2 optimal encoding construction
of Soloveichik and Winfree (SICOMP 2007), and perhaps of independent interest."
"We demonstrate reservoir computing with a physical system using a single
autonomous Boolean logic element with time-delay feedback. The system generates
a chaotic transient with a window of consistency lasting between 30 and 300 ns,
which we show is sufficient for reservoir computing. We then characterize the
dependence of computational performance on system parameters to find the best
operating point of the reservoir. When the best parameters are chosen, the
reservoir is able to classify short input patterns with performance that
decreases over time. In particular, we show that four distinct input patterns
can be classified for 70 ns, even though the inputs are only provided to the
reservoir for 7.5 ns."
"Memcomputing is a novel non-Turing paradigm of computation that uses
interacting memory cells (memprocessors for short) to store and process
information on the same physical platform. It was recently proved
mathematically that memcomputing machines have the same computational power of
non-deterministic Turing machines. Therefore, they can solve NP-complete
problems in polynomial time and, using the appropriate architecture, with
resources that only grow polynomially with the input size. The reason for this
computational power stems from properties inspired by the brain and shared by
any universal memcomputing machine, in particular intrinsic parallelism and
information overhead, namely the capability of compressing information in the
collective state of the memprocessor network. Here, we show an experimental
demonstration of an actual memcomputing architecture that solves the
NP-complete version of the subset-sum problem in only one step and is composed
of a number of memprocessors that scales linearly with the size of the problem.
We have fabricated this architecture using standard microelectronic technology
so that it can be easily realized in any laboratory setting. Even though the
particular machine presented here is eventually limited by noise--and will thus
require error-correcting codes to scale to an arbitrary number of
memprocessors--it represents the first proof-of-concept of a machine capable of
working with the collective state of interacting memory cells, unlike the
present-day single-state machines built using the von Neumann architecture."
"The underlying physiological mechanisms of generating conscious states are
still unknown. To make progress on the problem of consciousness, we will need
to experimentally design a system that evolves in a similar way our brains do.
Recent experimental data show that the multiscale nature of the evolving human
brain can be implemented by reprogramming human cells. A hybrid system can be
designed to include an evolving brain equipped with digital computers that
maintain homeostasis and provide the right amount of nutrients and oxygen for
the brain growth. Shaping the structure of the evolving brain will be
progressively achieved by controlling spatial organization of various types of
cells. Following a specific program, the evolving brain can be trained using
substitutional reality to learn and experience live scenes. We already know
from neuroelectrodynamics that meaningful information in the brain is
electrically (wirelessly) read out and written fast in neurons and synapses at
the molecular (protein) level during the generation of action potentials and
synaptic activities. Since with training, meaningful information accumulates
and is electrically integrated in the brain, one can predict, that this gradual
process of training will trigger a tipping point for conscious experience to
emerge in the hybrid system."
"Brain inspired circuits can provide an alternative solution to implement
computing architectures taking advantage of fault tolerance and generalisation
ability of logic gates. In this brief, we advance over the memristive threshold
circuit configuration consisting of memristive averaging circuit in combination
with operational amplifier and/or CMOS inverters in application to realizing
complex computing circuits. The developed memristive threshold logic gates are
used for designing FFT and multiplication circuits useful for modern
microprocessors. Overall, the proposed threshold logic outperforms previous
memristive-CMOS logic cells on every aspect, however, indicate a lower chip
area, lower THD, and controllable leakage power, but a higher power dissipation
with respect to CMOS logic."
"In this paper, we describe a new neuro-inspired, hardware-friendly readout
stage for the liquid state machine (LSM), a popular model for reservoir
computing. Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the
p-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of
readout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain
better performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it
attractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of
dendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having
multiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity. The number of synaptic
connections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of
connections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find
the best 'combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error.
Hence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network
similar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts. We
show that compared to a single perceptron using analog weights, this
architecture for the readout can attain, even by using the same number of
binary valued synapses, up to 3.3 times less error for a two-class spike train
classification problem and 2.4 times less error for an input rate approximation
task. Even with 60 times larger synapses, a group of 60 parallel perceptrons
cannot attain the performance of the proposed dendritically enhanced readout.
An additional advantage of this method for hardware implementations is that the
'choice' of connectivity can be easily implemented exploiting address event
representation (AER) protocols commonly used in current neuromorphic systems
where the connection matrix is stored in memory. Also, due to the use of binary
synapses, our proposed method is more robust against statistical variations."
"The reviewed paper describes an analog device that empirically solves small
instances of the NP-complete Subset Sum Problem (SSP). The authors claim that
this device can solve the SSP in polynomial time using polynomial space, in
principle, and observe no exponential scaling in resource requirements. We
point out that (a) the properties ascribed by the authors to their device are
insufficient to solve NP-complete problems in poly-time, (b) runtime analysis
offered does not cover the spectral measurement step, (c) the overall technique
requires exponentially increasing resources when scaled up because of the
spectral measurement step."
"The Pattern self-Assembly Tile set Synthesis (PATS) problem, which arises in
the theory of structured DNA self-assembly, is to determine a set of coloured
tiles that, starting from a bordering seed structure, self-assembles to a given
rectangular colour pattern. The task of finding minimum-size tile sets is known
to be NP-hard. We explore several complete and incomplete search techniques for
finding minimal, or at least small, tile sets and also assess the reliability
of the solutions obtained according to the kinetic Tile Assembly Model."
"Quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts
in terms of solving some specific, but important problems. The biggest
challenge in realizing a quantum computing system is the environmental noise.
One way to decrease the effect of noise (and hence, reduce the overhead of
building fault tolerant quantum circuits) is to reduce the latency of the
quantum circuit that runs on a quantum circuit. In this paper, a novel
algorithm is presented for scheduling, placement, and routing of a quantum
algorithm, which is to be realized on a target quantum circuit fabric
technology. This algorithm, and the accompanying software tool, advances
state-of-the-art in quantum CAD methodologies and methods while considering key
characteristics and constraints of the ion-trap quantum circuit fabric.
Experimental results show that the presented tool improves results of the
previous tool by about 41%."
"Quantum algorithms for solving problems of interesting size often result in
circuits with a very large number of qubits and quantum gates. Fortunately,
these algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used
quantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such
quantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the
corresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type
of quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results
in a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits
among quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall
circuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the
quantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum
processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to
mapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable
quantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum
circuit into a number of quantum kernels- each kernel comprises k parts such
that each part will run on exactly one of k available cores. Experimental
results demonstrate that Squash can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while
providing an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits."
"We present the syntax and rules of deduction of QPEL (Quantum Program and
Effect Language), a language for describing both quantum programs, and
properties of quantum programs - effects on the appropriate Hilbert space. We
show how semantics may be given in terms of state-and-effect triangles, a
categorical setting that allows semantics in terms of Hilbert spaces,
C*-algebras, and other categories. We prove soundness and completeness results
that show the derivable judgements are exactly those provable in all
state-and-effect triangles."
"We present the circuit board integration of a self-healing mechanism to
repair open faults. The electric field driven mechanism physically restores
fractured interconnects in electronic circuits and has the ability to solve
mazes. The repair is performed by conductive particles dispersed in an
insulating fluid. We demonstrate the integration of the healing module onto
printed circuit boards and the ability of maze solving. We model and perform
experiments on the influence of the geometry of the conductive particles as
well as the terminal impedances of the route on the healing efficiency. The
typical heal rate is 10 $\mu$m/s with healed route having resistance of 100
$\Omega$ to 20 k$\Omega$ depending on the materials and concentrations used."
"Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the use of Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) for vision, classification, and inference problems. An
artificial neuron sums N weighted inputs and passes the result through a
non-linear transfer function. Large-scale ANNs impose very high computing
requirements for training and classification, leading to great interest in the
use of post-CMOS devices to realize them in an energy efficient manner. In this
paper, we propose a spin-transfer-torque (STT) device based on Domain Wall
Motion (DWM) magnetic strip that can efficiently implement a Soft-limiting
Non-linear Neuron (SNN) operating at ultra-low supply voltage and current. In
contrast to previous spin-based neurons that can only realize hard-limiting
transfer functions, the proposed STT-SNN displays a continuous resistance
change with varying input current, and can therefore be employed to implement a
soft-limiting neuron transfer function. Soft-limiting neurons are greatly
preferred to hard-limiting ones due to their much improved modeling capacity,
which leads to higher network accuracy and lower network complexity. We also
present an ANN hardware design employing the proposed STT-SNNs and Memristor
Crossbar Arrays (MCA) as synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of the
magneto metallic STT-SNN enables the programmable MCA-synapses, computing
analog-domain weighted summation of input voltages, to also operate at
ultra-low voltage. We modeled the STT-SNN using micro-magnetic simulation and
evaluated them using an ANN for character recognition. Comparisons with analog
and digital CMOS neurons show that STT-SNNs can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude lower energy consumption."
"This paper presents LEQA, a fast latency estimation tool for evaluating the
performance of a quantum algorithm mapped to a quantum fabric. The actual
quantum algorithm latency can be computed by performing detailed scheduling,
placement and routing of the quantum instructions and qubits in a quantum
operation dependency graph on a quantum circuit fabric. This is, however, a
very expensive proposition that requires large amounts of processing time.
Instead, LEQA, which is based on computing the neighborhood population counts
of qubits, can produce estimates of the circuit latency with good accuracy
(i.e., an average of less than 3% error) with up to two orders of magnitude
speedup for mid-size benchmarks. This speedup is expected to increase
superlinearly as a function of circuit size (operation count)."
"This paper presents a physical mapping tool for quantum circuits, which
generates the optimal Universal Logic Block (ULB) that can perform any logical
fault-tolerant (FT) quantum operations with the minimum latency. The operation
scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum
physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the
scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution
due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation
scheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions
influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between
predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.
The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies
by applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum
data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the
quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified
force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and
quantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven
instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while
making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct
scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step
that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to
the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single
best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of
different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using
information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of
the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies."
"Reservoir computing is a recent bio-inspired approach for processing
time-dependent signals. It has enabled a breakthrough in analog information
processing, with several experiments, both electronic and optical,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performances for hard tasks such as speech
recognition, time series prediction and nonlinear channel equalization. A
proof-of-principle experiment using a linear optical circuit on a photonic chip
to process digital signals was recently reported. Here we present a photonic
implementation of a reservoir computer based on a coherently driven passive
fiber cavity processing analog signals. Our experiment has error rate as low or
lower than previous experiments on a wide variety of tasks, and also has lower
power consumption. Furthermore, the analytical model describing our experiment
is also of interest, as it constitutes a very simple high performance reservoir
computer algorithm. The present experiment, given its good performances, low
energy consumption and conceptual simplicity, confirms the great potential of
photonic reservoir computing for information processing applications ranging
from artificial intelligence to telecommunications"
"Electrostatically Formed Nanowire (EFN) based transistors have been suggested
in the past as gas sensing devices. These transistors are multiple gate
transistors in which the source to drain conduction path is determined by the
bias applied to the back gate, and two junction gates. If a specific bias is
applied to the side gates, the conduction band electrons between them are
confined to a well-defined area forming a narrow channel- the Electrostatically
Formed Nanowire. Recent work has shown that by applying non-symmetric bias on
the side gates, the lateral position of the EFN can be controlled. We propose a
novel Multiple State EFN Transistor (MSET) that utilizes this degree of freedom
for the implementation of complete multiplexer functionality in a single
transistor like device. The multiplexer functionality allows a very simple
implementation of binary and multiple valued logic functions."
"In this paper, we extend existing results about simulation and intrinsic
universality in a model of tile-based self-assembly. Namely, we work within the
2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), which is a model of self-assembly in which
assemblies are formed by square tiles that are allowed to combine, using glues
along their edges, individually or as pairs of arbitrarily large assemblies in
a hierarchical manner, and we explore the abilities of these systems to
simulate each other when the simulating systems have a higher ""temperature""
parameter, which is a system wide threshold dictating how many glue bonds must
be formed between two assemblies to allow them to combine. It has previously
been shown that systems with lower temperatures cannot simulate arbitrary
systems with higher temperatures, and also that systems at some higher
temperatures can simulate those at particular lower temperatures, creating an
infinite set of infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing
simulation power within each hierarchy. These previous results relied on two
different definitions of simulation, one (strong simulation) seemingly more
restrictive than the other (standard simulation), but which have previously not
been proven to be distinct. Here we prove distinctions between them by first
fully characterizing the set of pairs of temperatures such that the high
temperature systems are intrinsically universal for the lower temperature
systems (i.e. one tile set at the higher temperature can simulate any at the
lower) using strong simulation. This includes the first impossibility result
for simulation downward in temperature. We then show that lower temperature
systems which cannot be simulated by higher temperature systems using the
strong definition, can in fact be simulated using the standard definition,
proving the distinction between the types of simulation."
"Quantum annealing is a proposed combinatorial optimization technique meant to
exploit quantum mechanical effects such as tunneling and entanglement.
Real-world quantum annealing-based solvers require a combination of annealing
and classical pre- and post-processing; at this early stage, little is known
about how to partition and optimize the processing. This article presents an
experimental case study of quantum annealing and some of the factors involved
in real-world solvers, using a 504-qubit D-Wave Two machine and the graph
isomorphism problem. To illustrate the role of classical pre-processing, a
compact Hamiltonian is presented that enables a reduced Ising model for each
problem instance. On random N-vertex graphs, the median number of variables is
reduced from N^2 to fewer than N lg N and solvable graph sizes increase from N
= 5 to N = 13. Additionally, a type of classical post-processing error
correction is evaluated. While the solution times are not competitive with
classical approaches to graph isomorphism, the enhanced solver ultimately
classified correctly every problem that was mapped to the processor and
demonstrated clear advantages over the baseline approach. The results shed some
light on the nature of real-world quantum annealing and the associated hybrid
classical-quantum solvers."
"The true slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a recent well studied example
of how complex transport networks emerge from simple auto-catalytic and self-
organising local interactions, adapting structure and function against changing
environmental conditions and external perturbation. Physarum networks also
exhibit computationally desirable measures of transport efficiency in terms of
overall path length, minimal connectivity and network resilience. Although
significant progress has been made in mathematically modelling the behaviour of
Physarum networks (and other biological transport networks) based on observed
features in experimental settings, their initial emergence - and in particular
their long-term persistence and evolution - is still poorly understood. We
present a low-level, bottom-up, approach to the modelling of emergent transport
networks. A population of simple particle-like agents coupled with paracrine
chemotaxis behaviours in a dissipative environment results in the spontaneous
emergence of persistent, complex structures. Second order emergent behaviours,
in the form of network surface minimisation, are also observed contributing to
the long term evolution and dynamics of the networks. The framework is extended
to allow data presentation and the population is used to perform a direct
(spatial) approximation of network minimisation problems. Three methods are
employed, loosely relating to behaviours of Physarum under different
environmental conditions. Finally, the low-level approach is summarised with a
view to further research."
"The recent development in analog computation is reviewed in this paper.
Analog computation was used in many applications where power and energy
efficiency is of paramount importance. It is shown that by using innovative
architecture and circuit design, analog computation systems can achieve much
higher energy efficiency than their digital counterparts, as they are able to
exploit the computational power inherent to the devices and physics. However,
these systems do suffer from some disadvantages, such as lower accuracy and
speed, and designers have come up with novel approaches to overcome them. The
paper provides an overview of analog computation systems, from basic components
such as memory and arithmetic elements, to architecture and system design."
"Plans for a new type of artificial brain are possible because of realistic
neurons in logically structured arrays of controlled toggles, one toggle per
neuron. Controlled toggles can be made to compute, in parallel, parameters of
critical importance for each of several complex images recalled from
associative long term memory. Controlled toggles are shown below to amount to a
new type of neural network that supports autonomous behavior and action."
"Exact synthesis is a tool used in algorithms for approximating an arbitrary
qubit unitary with a sequence of quantum gates from some finite set. These
approximation algorithms find asymptotically optimal approximations in
probabilistic polynomial time, in some cases even finding the optimal solution
in probabilistic polynomial time given access to an oracle for factoring
integers. In this paper, we present a common mathematical structure underlying
all results related to the exact synthesis of qubit unitaries known to date,
including Clifford+T, Clifford-cyclotomic and V-basis gate sets, as well as
gates sets induced by the braiding of Fibonacci anyons in topological quantum
computing. The framework presented here also provides a means to answer
questions related to the exact synthesis of unitaries for wide classes of other
gate sets, such as Clifford+T+V and SU(2) level k anyons."
"Until now, most memristor-based chaotic circuits proposed in the literature
are based on mathematical models which assume ideal characteristics such as
piece-wise linear or cubic non-linearities. The idea, illustrated here and
originating from the experimental approach for device characterization, is to
realize a chaotic system exploiting the non-linearity of only one memristor
with a very simple experimental set-up using feedback. In this way a simple
circuit is obtained and chaos is experimentally observed and is confirmed by
the calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent. Numerical results using the
Strukov model support the existence of robust chaos in our circuit. This is the
first experimental demonstration of chaos in a real memristor circuit and
suggests that memristors are well placed for hardware encryption."
"The reversible logic can be used in various research areas, e.g. quantum
computation, cryptography and signal processing. In the paper we study
reversible logic circuits with additional inputs, which consist of NOT, CNOT
and C\textsuperscript{2}NOT gates. We consider a set $F(n,q)$ of all
transformations $\mathbb B^n \to \mathbb B^n$ that can be realized by
reversible circuits with $(n+q)$ inputs. An analogue of Lupanov's method for
the synthesis of reversible logic circuits with additional inputs is described.
We prove upper asymptotic bounds for the Shannon gate complexity function
$L(n,q)$ and the depth function $D(n,q)$ in case of $q > 0$: $L(n,q_0) \lesssim
2^n$ if $q_0 \sim n 2^{n-o(n)}$ and $D(n,q_1) \lesssim 3n$ if $q_1 \sim 2^n$."
"We present a new circuit for non-Boolean recognition of binary images.
Employing all-spin logic (ASL) devices, we design logic comparators and
non-Boolean decision blocks for compact and efficient computation. By
manipulation of fan-in number in different stages of the circuit, the structure
can be extended for larger training sets or larger images. Operating based on
the mainly similarity idea, the system is capable of constructing a mean image
and compare it with a separate input image within a short decision time. Taking
advantage of the non-volatility of ASL devices, the proposed circuit is capable
of hybrid memory/logic operation. Compared with existing CMOS pattern
recognition circuits, this work achieves a smaller footprint, lower power
consumption, faster decision time and a lower operational voltage. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first fully spin-based complete pattern
recognition circuit demonstrated using spintronic devices."
"Time-of-flight, i.e., the time incurred by a signal to travel from
transmitter to receiver, is perhaps the most intuitive way to measure distances
using wireless signals. It is used in major positioning systems such as GPS,
RADAR, and SONAR. However, attempts at using time-of-flight for indoor
localization have failed to deliver acceptable accuracy due to fundamental
limitations in measuring time on Wi-Fi and other RF consumer technologies.
While the research community has developed alternatives for RF-based indoor
localization that do not require time-of-flight, those approaches have their
own limitations that hamper their use in practice. In particular, many existing
approaches need receivers with large antenna arrays while commercial Wi-Fi
nodes have two or three antennas. Other systems require fingerprinting the
environment to create signal maps. More fundamentally, none of these methods
support indoor positioning between a pair of Wi-Fi devices
without~third~party~support.
  In this paper, we present a set of algorithms that measure the time-of-flight
to sub-nanosecond accuracy on commercial Wi-Fi cards. We implement these
algorithms and demonstrate a system that achieves accurate device-to-device
localization, i.e. enables a pair of Wi-Fi devices to locate each other without
any support from the infrastructure, not even the location of the access
points."
"We report on an artificial synapse, an organic synapse-transistor (synapstor)
working at 1 volt and with a typical response time in the range 100-200 ms.
This device (also called NOMFET, Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field Effect
Transistor) combines a memory and a transistor effect in a single device. We
demonstrate that short-term plasticity (STP), a typical synaptic behavior, is
observed when stimulating the device with input spikes of 1 volt. Both
significant facilitating and depressing behaviors of this artificial synapse
are observed with a relative amplitude of about 50% and a dynamic response <
200 ms. From a series of in-situ experiments, i.e. measuring the
current-voltage characteristic curves in-situ and in real time, during the
growth of the pentacene over a network of gold nanoparticles, we elucidate
these results by analyzing the relationship between the organic film morphology
and the transport properties. This synapstor works at a low energy of about 2
nJ/spike. We discuss the implications of these results for the development of
neuro-inspired computing architectures and interfacing with biological neurons."
"Metal-oxide memristors have emerged as promising candidates for hardware
implementation of artificial synapses - the key components of high-performance,
analog neuromorphic networks - due to their excellent scaling prospects. Since
some advanced cognitive tasks require spiking neuromorphic networks, which
explicitly model individual neural pulses (spikes) in biological neural
systems, it is crucial for memristive synapses to support the
spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is believed to be the primary
mechanism of Hebbian adaptation. A major challenge for the STDP implementation
is that, in contrast to some simplistic models of the plasticity, the
elementary change of a synaptic weight in an artificial hardware synapse
depends not only on the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic signals, but also on the
initial weight (memristor's conductance) value. Here we experimentally
demonstrate, for the first time, STDP protocols that ensure self-adaptation of
the average memristor conductance, making the plasticity stable, i.e.
insensitive to the initial state of the devices. The experiments have been
carried out with 200-nm Al2O3/TiO2-x memristors integrated into 12x12
crossbars. The experimentally observed self-adaptive STDP behavior has been
complemented with numerical modeling of weight dynamics in a simple system with
a leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron with a random spike-train input, using a
compact model of memristor plasticity, fitted for quantitatively correct
description of our memristors."
"In this paper we introduce the \emph{robust random number generation} problem
where the goal is to design an abstract tile assembly system (aTAM system)
whose terminal assemblies can be split into $n$ partitions such that a
resulting assembly of the system lies within each partition with probability
1/$n$, regardless of the relative concentration assignment of the tile types in
the system. First, we show this is possible for $n=2$ (a \emph{robust fair coin
flip}) within the aTAM, and that such systems guarantee a worst case
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ space usage. We accompany our primary construction with
variants that show trade-offs in space complexity, initial seed size,
temperature, tile complexity, bias, and extensibility, and also prove some
negative results. As an application, we combine our coin-flip system with a
result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and Reif to show that for any positive
integer $n$, there exists a $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ tile system that assembles a
constant-width linear assembly of expected length $n$ for any concentration
assignment. We then extend our robust fair coin flip result to solve the
problem of robust random number generation in the aTAM for all $n$. Two
variants of robust random bit generation solutions are presented: an unbounded
space solution and a bounded space solution which incurs a small bias. Further,
we consider the harder scenario where tile concentrations change arbitrarily at
each assembly step and show that while this is not possible in the aTAM, the
problem can be solved by exotic tile assembly models from the literature."
"Neuromorphic systems that densely integrate CMOS spiking neurons and
nano-scale memristor synapses open a new avenue of brain-inspired computing.
Existing silicon neurons have molded neural biophysical dynamics but are
incompatible with memristor synapses, or used extra training circuitry thus
eliminating much of the density advantages gained by using memristors, or were
energy inefficient. Here we describe a novel CMOS spiking leaky
integrate-and-fire neuron circuit. Building on a reconfigurable architecture
with a single opamp, the described neuron accommodates a large number of
memristor synapses, and enables online spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
learning with optimized power consumption. Simulation results of an 180nm CMOS
design showed 97% power efficiency metric when realizing STDP learning in
10,000 memristor synapses with a nominal 1M{\Omega} memristance, and only
13{\mu}A current consumption when integrating input spikes. Therefore, the
described CMOS neuron contributes a generalized building block for large-scale
brain-inspired neuromorphic systems."
"Reversible logic has attracted much research interest over the last few
decades, especially due to its application in quantum computing. In the
construction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly
used to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic
gates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and
Fredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be
expensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla
bits a practical topic.
  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single
base gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of
the 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three
main results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can
generate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated
Toffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations
using no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative
reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known
result for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known
result for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is
trivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove
their optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible
gates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate
all n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We
also explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new
concept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate
all n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an
unlimited number of borrowed bits."
"Based on the concept of DNA strand displacement and DNA strand algebra we
have developed a method for logical inference which is not based on silicon
based computing. Essentially, it is a paradigm shift from silicon to carbon. In
this paper we have considered the inference mechanism, viz. modus ponens, to
draw conclusion from any observed fact. Thus, the present approach to logical
inference based on DNA strand algebra is basically an attempt to develop expert
system design in the domain of DNA computing. We have illustrated our
methodology with respect to worked out example. Our methodology is very
flexible for implementation of different expert system applications."
"This article presents a review on the main applications of the fourth
fundamental circuit element, named ""memristor"", which had been proposed for the
first time by Leon Chua and has recently been developed by a team at HP
Laboratories led by Stanley Williams. In particular, after a brief analysis of
memristor theory with a description of the first memristor, manufactured at HP
Laboratories, we present its main applications in the circuit design and
computer technology, together with future developments."
"This paper proposes a new class of hardware accelerators to alleviate
bottlenecks in the acquisition, analytics, storage and computation of
information carried by wideband streaming signals."
"This paper is centered on using chemical reaction as a computational metaphor
for simultaneously solving problems. An artificial chemical reactor that can
simultaneously solve instances of three unrelated problems was created. The
reactor is a distributed stochastic algorithm that simulates a chemical
universe wherein the molecular species are being represented either by a human
genomic contig panel, a Hamiltonian cycle, or an aircraft landing schedule. The
chemical universe is governed by reactions that can alter genomic sequences,
re-order Hamiltonian cycles, or reschedule an aircraft landing program.
Molecular masses were considered as measures of goodness of solutions, and
represented radiation hybrid (RH) vector similarities, costs of Hamiltonian
cycles, and penalty costs for landing an aircraft before and after target
landing times. This method, tested by solving in tandem with deterministic
algorithms, has been shown to find quality solutions in finding the minima RH
vector similarities of genomic data, minima costs in Hamiltonian cycles of the
traveling salesman, and minima costs for landing aircrafts before or after
target landing times."
"Recent studies have shown that adaptively regulating the sampling rate
results in significant reduction in computational resources in embedded
software based control. Selecting a uniform sampling rate for a control loop is
robust, but overtly pessimistic for sharing processors among multiple control
loops. Fine grained regulation of periodicity achieves better resource
utilization, but is hard to implement online in a robust way. In this paper we
propose multi-mode sampling period selection, derived from an offline control
theoretic analysis of the system. We report significant gains in computational
efficiency without trading off control performance."
"Presented in this paper is a derivation of a 2D catalytic reaction-based
model to solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The simulated
catalytic reactions, a computational metaphor, occurs in an artificial chemical
reactor that finds near-optimal solutions to COPs. The artificial environment
is governed by catalytic reactions that can alter the structure of artificial
molecular elements. Altering the molecular structure means finding new
solutions to the COP. The molecular mass of the elements was considered as a
measure of goodness of fit of the solutions. Several data structures and
matrices were used to record the directions and locations of the molecules.
These provided the model the 2D topology. The Traveling Salesperson Problem
(TSP) was used as a working example. The performance of the model in finding a
solution for the TSP was compared to the performance of a topology-less model.
Experimental results show that the 2D model performs better than the
topology-less one."
"Actin is a globular protein which forms long polar filaments in the
eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Actin networks play a key role in cell mechanics and
cell motility. They have also been implicated in information transmission and
processing, memory and learning in neuronal cells. The acting filaments have
been shown to support propagation of voltage pulses. Here we apply a coupled
nonlinear transmission line model of actin filaments to study interactions
between voltage pulses. By assigning a logical {\sc Truth} to the presence of a
voltage pulses in a given location of the actin filament, and {\sc False} to
the pulse's absence we represent digital information transmission along these
filaments. When two pulses, representing Boolean values of input variables,
interact, then they can facilitate or inhibit further propagation of each
other. We explore this phenomenon to construct Boolean logical gates and a
one-bit half-adder with interacting voltage pulses. We discuss implications of
these findings on cellular process and technological applications."
"Efficient generation of spin currents from charge currents is of high
importance for memory and logic applications of spintronics. In particular,
generation of spin currents from charge currents in high spin-orbit coupling
metals has the potential to provide a scalable solution for embedded memory. We
demonstrate a net reduction in critical charge current for spin torque driven
magnetization reversal via using spin-orbit mediated spin current generation.
We scaled the dimensions of the spin-orbit electrode to 400 nm and the
nanomagnet to 270 nm x 68 nm in a three terminal spin-orbit torque, magnetic
tunnel junction (SOT-MTJ) geometry. Our estimated effective spin Hall angle is
0.15-0.20 using the ratio of zero temperature critical current from spin Hall
switching and estimated spin current density for switching the magnet. We show
bidirectional transient switching using spin-orbit generated spin torque at 100
ns switching pulses reliably followed by transient read operations. We finally
compare the static and dynamic response of the SOT-MTJ with transient spin
circuit modeling showing the performance of scaled SOT-MTJs to enable
nanosecond class non-volatile MTJs."
"A medium access control protocol based on quantum entanglement has been
introduced by Berces and Imre (2006) and Van Meter (2012). This protocol
entirely avoids collisions. It is assumed that the network consists of one
access point and two client stations. We extend this scheme to a network with
an arbitrary number of client stations. We propose three approaches, namely,
the qubit distribution, transmit first election and temporal ordering
protocols. The qubit distribution protocol leverages the concepts of Bell-EPR
pair or W state triad. It works for networks of up to four CSs. With up to
three CSs, there is no probability of collision. In a four-CS network, there is
a low probability of collision. The transmit first election protocol and
temporal ordering protocols work for a network with any number of CSs. The
transmit first election builds upon the concept of W state of size
corresponding to the number of client stations. It is fair and collision free.
The temporal ordering protocol employs the concepts of Lehmer code and quantum
oracle. It is collision free, has a normalized throughput of 100% and achieves
quasi-fairness."
"The service paradigm as we know it has gone through a long journey of
evolution and improvement, and it seems that a service-oriented vision to
activities in general could serve as a potential platform for the global
transition to a sustainable future. However, it is also apparent that the
services themselves are required to move beyond their traditional definition in
order to prevent any secondary side effect. Here, a new paradigm is proposed
based on bonding between entities involved in a service interaction, service
chaining, or service orchestration. It is purposed to serve as a vehicle to
approach sustainability at the global level in a manner that is thoughtful,
collaborative, and incremental. Time-modulated implementation of the proposed
service-bond paradigm is considered in order to reduce the associated risks and
liabilities. The service bonds are then simply generalized toward representing
bonding among more than two entities. Finally, a practical application of ICT
agents in enabling the service bonds is presented in a use case related to
smart houses. In this use case, some ICT-based agents (federal regulars, among
other ICT agents) are considered to represent and govern services and service
bonds of a household with external entities such as utilities."
"In Boolean algebra, it is known that the logical function that corresponds to
the negation of the conjunction --NAND-- is universal in the sense that any
other logical function can be built based on it. This property makes it
essential to modern digital electronics and computer processor design. Here, we
design a molecular Turing machine that computes the NAND function over binary
strings of arbitrary length. For this purpose, we will perform a mathematical
abstraction of the kind of operations that can be done over a double-stranded
DNA molecule, as well as presenting a molecular encoding of the input symbols
for such a machine."
"Various implementations of the Toffoli gate up to a relative phase have been
known for years. The advantage over regular Toffoli gate is their smaller
circuit size. However, their use has been often limited to a demonstration of
quantum control in designs such as those where the Toffoli gate is being
applied last or otherwise for some specific reasons the relative phase does not
matter. It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would
prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical
large-scale designs.
  In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for
replacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with
their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on
certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate
the advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known
circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates, and report the reductions
in the CNOT-count, T-count, as well as the number of ancillae used. We suggest
that a further study of the relative phase Toffoli implementations and their
use may yield other optimizations."
"We address the task of switching off the Hamiltonian of a system by removing
all internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling
schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems
with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we
introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs)
and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The
derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex
schemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a
$2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as
$O(n \log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled
quadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays
constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength
decoupling for any $\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\ell \geq 2$, can be
achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\ell-1} \log n)$."
"In this paper we summarize the existing principles for building
unconventional computing devices that involve delayed signals for encoding
solutions to NP-complete problems. We are interested in the following aspects:
the properties of the signal, the operations performed within the devices, some
components required for the physical implementation, precision required for
correctly reading the solution and the decrease in the signal's strength. Six
problems have been solved so far by using the above enumerated principles:
Hamiltonian path, travelling salesman, bounded and unbounded subset sum,
Diophantine equations and exact cover. For the hardware implementation several
types of signals can be used: light, electric power, sound, electro-magnetic
etc."
"Monolithic three-dimensional integration of memory and logic circuits could
dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency of computing systems.
Some conventional and emerging memories are suitable for vertical integration,
including highly scalable metal-oxide resistive switching devices (memristors),
yet integration of logic circuits proves to be much more challenging. Here we
demonstrate memory and logic functionality in a monolithic three-dimensional
circuit by adapting recently proposed memristor-based stateful material
implication logic. Though such logic has been already implemented with a
variety of memory devices, prohibitively large device variability in the most
prospective memristor-based circuits has limited experimental demonstrations to
simple gates and just a few cycles of operations. By developing a
low-temperature, low-variability fabrication process, and modifying the
original circuit to increase its robustness to device imperfections, we
experimentally show, for the first time, reliable multi-cycle multi-gate
material implication logic operation within a three-dimensional stack of
monolithically integrated memristors. The direct data manipulation in three
dimensions enables extremely compact and high-throughput logic-in-memory
computing and, remarkably, presents a viable solution for the Feynman grand
challenge of implementing an 8-bit adder at the nanoscale."
"Now a day reversible logic is an attractive research area due to its low
power consumption in the area of VLSI circuit design. The reversible logic gate
is utilized to optimize power consumption by a feature of retrieving input
logic from an output logic because of bijective mapping between input and
output. In this manuscript, we design 4 2 and 5 2 reversible compressor
circuits using a new type of reversible gate. In addition, we propose new gate,
named as inventive0 gate for optimizing a compressor circuit. The utility of
the inventive0 gate is that it can be used as full adder and full subtraction
with low value of garbage outputs and quantum cost. An algorithm is shown for
designing a compressor structure. The comparative study shows that the proposed
compressor structure outperforms the existing ones in terms of garbage outputs,
number of gates and quantum cost. The compressor can reduce the effect of carry
(Produce from full adder) of the arithmetic frame design. In addition, we
implement a basic reversible gate of MOS transistor with less number of MOS
transistor count."
"We introduce a new model of algorithmic tile self-assembly called
size-dependent assembly. In previous models, supertiles are stable when the
total strength of the bonds between any two halves exceeds some constant
temperature. In this model, this constant temperature requirement is replaced
by an nondecreasing temperature function $\tau : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}$ that depends on the size of the smaller of the two halves. This
generalization allows supertiles to become unstable and break apart, and
captures the increased forces that large structures may place on the bonds
holding them together.
  We demonstrate the power of this model in two ways. First, we give fixed tile
sets that assemble constant-height rectangles and squares of arbitrary input
size given an appropriate temperature function. Second, we prove that deciding
whether a supertile is stable is coNP-complete. Both results contrast with
known results for fixed temperature."
"We introduce two new Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key
distribution schemes which are generalizations of the original KLJN scheme. The
first of these, the Random-Resistor (RR-) KLJN scheme, uses random resistors
with values chosen from a quasi-continuum set. It is well-known since the
creation of the KLJN concept that such a system could work in cryptography,
because Alice and Bob can calculate the unknown resistance value from
measurements, but the RR-KLJN system has not been addressed in prior
publications since it was considered impractical. The reason for discussing it
now is the second scheme, the Random-Resistor-Random-Temperature (RRRT-) KLJN
key exchange, inspired by a recent paper of Vadai, Mingesz and Gingl, wherein
security was shown to be maintained at non-zero power flow. In the RRRT-KLJN
secure key exchange scheme, both the resistances and their temperatures are
continuum random variables. We prove that the security of the RRRT-KLJN scheme
can prevail at non-zero power flow, and thus the physical law guaranteeing
security is not the Second Law of Thermodynamics but the
Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Alice and Bob know their own resistances and
temperatures and can calculate the resistance and temperature values at the
other end of the communication channel from measured voltage, current and
power-flow data in the wire. However, Eve cannot determine these values
because, for her, there are four unknown quantities while she can set up only
three equations. The RRRT-KLJN scheme has several advantages and makes all
former attacks on the KLJN scheme invalid or incomplete."
"Resistive Switching (RS) is the change in resistance of a dielectric under
the influence of an external current or electric field. This change is
non-volatile, and the basis of both the memristor and resistive random access
memory. In the latter, high integration densities favor the anti-serial
combination of two RS-elements to a single cell, termed the complementary
resistive switch (CRS). Motivated by the irregular shape of the filament
protruding into the device, we suggest a nonlinearity in the
resistance-interpolation function, and thereby expand the original
HP-memristor. We numerically simulate and analytically solve this model.
Further, the nonlinearity allows for its application to the CRS."
"We develop a framework for resource efficient compilation of higher-level
programs into lower-level reversible circuits. Our main focus is on optimizing
the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by
the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three
main techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing
classical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first,
wherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to
modify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is
introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing
to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to ""garbage collection"" for
reversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to
transform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space
constraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed.
  We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a
subset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which
can then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific
language for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a
number of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including
reversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions,
reversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational
circuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method,
REVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an
only moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to
compile the reversible networks."
"Seamless connection of molecular nanonetworks to macroscale cyber networks is
envisioned to enable the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, which promises for
cutting-edge applications, especially in the medical domain. The connection
requires the development of an interface between the biochemical domain of
molecular nanonetworks and the electrical domain of conventional
electromagnetic networks. To this aim, in this paper, we propose to exploit
field effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs) to devise a molecular
antenna capable of transducing molecular messages into electrical signals. In
particular, focusing on the use of SiNW FET-based biosensors as molecular
antennas, we develop deterministic and noise models for the antenna operation
to provide a theoretical framework for the optimization of the device from
communication perspective. We numerically evaluate the performance of the
antenna in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the electrical output."
"We present an algorithm for efficiently approximating of qubit unitaries over
gate sets derived from totally definite quaternion algebras. It achieves
$\varepsilon$-approximations using circuits of length $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$,
which is asymptotically optimal. The algorithm achieves the same quality of
approximation as previously-known algorithms for Clifford+T [arXiv:1212.6253],
V-basis [arXiv:1303.1411] and Clifford+$\pi/12$ [arXiv:1409.3552], running on
average in time polynomial in $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ (conditional on a
number-theoretic conjecture). Ours is the first such algorithm that works for a
wide range of gate sets and provides insight into what should constitute a
""good"" gate set for a fault-tolerant quantum computer."
"We analyze the number of tile types $t$, bins $b$, and stages necessary to
assemble $n \times n$ squares and scaled shapes in the staged tile assembly
model. For $n \times n$ squares, we prove $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log{n} - tb -
t\log t}{b^2} + \frac{\log \log b}{\log t})$ stages suffice and
$\Omega(\frac{\log{n} - tb - t\log t}{b^2})$ are necessary for almost all $n$.
For shapes $S$ with Kolmogorov complexity $K(S)$, we prove
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{K(S) - tb - t\log t}{b^2} + \frac{\log \log b}{\log t})$
stages suffice and $\Omega(\frac{K(S) - tb - t\log t}{b^2})$ are necessary to
assemble a scaled version of $S$, for almost all $S$. We obtain similarly tight
bounds when the more powerful flexible glues are permitted."
"Self-assembly is ubiquitous in nature, particularly in biology, where it
underlies the formation of protein quaternary structure and protein
aggregation. Quaternary structure assembles deterministically and performs a
wide range of important functions in the cell, whereas protein aggregation is
the hallmark of a number of diseases and represents a non-deterministic
self-assembly process. Here we build on previous work on a lattice model of
deterministic self-assembly to investigate non-deterministic self-assembly of
single lattice tiles and mixtures of two tiles at varying relative
concentrations. Despite limiting the simplicity of the model to two interface
types, which results in 13 topologically distinct single tiles and 106
topologically distinct sets of two tiles, we observe a wide variety of
concentration-dependent behaviours. Several two-tile sets display critical
behaviours in form of a sharp transition from bound to unbound structures as
the relative concentration of one tile to another increases. Other sets exhibit
gradual monotonic changes in structural density, or non-monotonic changes,
while again others show no concentration dependence at all. We catalogue this
extensive range of behaviours and present a model that provides a reasonably
good estimate of the critical concentrations for a subset of the critical
transitions. In addition we show that the structures resulting from these tile
sets are fractal, with one of two different fractal dimensions."
"The ever growing demands of embedded systems to satisfy high computing
performance and cost efficiency lead to the trend of using commercial
off-the-shelf hardware. However, due to their highly integrated design they are
becoming increasingly susceptible to hardware errors (e.g. caused by
radiation-induced soft-errors or wear-out effects). Since such faults cannot be
fully prevented, systems have to cope with their effects. At the same time
there is the trend of multi-core processors in embedded systems. Approaches to
achieve fault tolerance by using the multiple cores to establish redundancy
have been presented in literature. However, typically only homogeneous
redundancy techniques are considered to tolerate soft errors. However, there is
a lack of appropriate reaction mechanisms for restoring the system in case of
permanent hardware faults.
  Here, we propose the basic idea of enhancing multi-core redundancy techniques
with a cost-efficient automated introduction of diversity in the executed
software replicas. Recently, these automated software diversity techniques have
attracted attention in the security domain. We propose to use these techniques
to recover from permanent hardware faults. This is achieved by adapting the
software execution in such a way that permanent faults are mitigated."
"We utilize the asymmetric random telegraph wave-based instantaneous
noise-base logic scheme to represent the problem of drawing numbers from a hat,
and we consider two identical hats with the first 2^N integer numbers. In the
first problem, Alice secretly draws an arbitrary number from one of the hats,
and Bob must find out which hat is missing a number. In the second problem,
Alice removes a known number from one of the hats and another known number from
the other hat, and Bob must identify these hats. We show that, when the
preparation of the hats with the numbers is accounted for, the noise-based
logic scheme always provides an exponential speed-up and/or it requires
exponentially smaller computational complexity than deterministic alternatives.
Both the stochasticity and the ability to superpose numbers are essential
components of the exponential improvement."
"The prospects of quantum computing have driven efforts to realize fully
functional quantum processing units (QPUs). Recent success in developing
proof-of-principle QPUs has prompted the question of how to integrate these
emerging processors into modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We
examine how QPUs can be integrated into current and future HPC system
architectures by accounting for functional and physical design requirements. We
identify two integration pathways that are differentiated by infrastructure
constraints on the QPU and the use cases expected for the HPC system. This
includes a tight integration that assumes infrastructure bottlenecks can be
overcome as well as a loose integration that assumes they cannot. We find that
the performance of both approaches is likely to depend on the quantum
interconnect that serves to entangle multiple QPUs. We also identify several
challenges in assessing QPU performance for HPC, and we consider new metrics
that capture the interplay between system architecture and the quantum
parallelism underlying computational performance."
"The objective of this paper is to explore the possibility to couple two van
der Pol (vdP) oscillators via a resistance-capacitance (RC) network comprising
a Ag-TiOx-Al memristive device. The coupling was mediated by connecting the
gate terminals of two programmable unijunction transistors (PUTs) through the
network. In the high resistance state (HRS) the memresistance was in the order
of MOhm leading to two independent selfsustained oscillators characterized by
the different frequencies f1 and f2 and no phase relation between the
oscillations. After a few cycles and in dependency of the mediated pulse
amplitude the memristive device switched to the low resistance state (LRS) and
a frequency adaptation and phase locking was observed. The experimental results
are underlined by theoretically considering a system of two coupled vdP
equations. The presented neuromorphic circuitry conveys two essentials
principle of interacting neuronal ensembles: synchronization and memory. The
experiment may path the way to larger neuromorphic networks in which the
coupling parameters can vary in time and strength and are realized by
memristive devices."
"We describe an approximation to backpropagation algorithm for training deep
neural networks, which is designed to work with synapses implemented with
memristors. The key idea is to represent the values of both the input signal
and the backpropagated delta value with a series of pulses that trigger
multiple positive or negative updates of the synaptic weight, and to use the
min operation instead of the product of the two signals. In computational
simulations, we show that the proposed approximation to backpropagation is well
converged and may be suitable for memristor implementations of multilayer
neural networks."
"Emerging nano-scale programmable Resistive-RAM (RRAM) has been identified as
a promising technology for implementing brain-inspired computing hardware.
Several neural network architectures, that essentially involve computation of
scalar products between input data vectors and stored network weights can be
efficiently implemented using high density cross-bar arrays of RRAM integrated
with CMOS. In such a design, the CMOS interface may be responsible for
providing input excitations and for processing the RRAM output. In order to
achieve high energy efficiency along with high integration density in RRAM
based neuromorphic hardware, the design of RRAM-CMOS interface can therefore
play a major role. In this work we propose design of high performance, current
mode CMOS interface for RRAM based neural network design. The use of current
mode excitation for input interface and design of digitally assisted
current-mode CMOS neuron circuit for the output interface is presented. The
proposed technique achieve 10x energy as well as performance improvement over
conventional approaches employed in literature. Network level simulations show
that the proposed scheme can achieve 2 orders of magnitude lower energy
dissipation as compared to a digital ASIC implementation of a feed-forward
neural network."
"New medical procedures promise continuous patient monitoring and drug
delivery through implanted sensors and actuators. When over the air wireless
radio frequency (OTA-RF) links are used for intra-body implant communication,
the network incurs heavy energy costs owing to absorption within the human
tissue. With this motivation, we explore an alternate form of intra-body
communication that relies on weak electrical signals, instead of OTA-RF. To
demonstrate the feasibility of this new paradigm for enabling communication
between sensors and actuators embedded within the tissue, or placed on the
surface of the skin, we develop a rigorous analytical model based on galvanic
coupling of low energy signals. The main contributions in this paper are: (i)
developing a suite of analytical expressions for modeling the resulting
communication channel for weak electrical signals in a three dimensional
multi-layered tissue structure, (ii) validating and verifying the model through
extensive finite element simulations, published measurements in existing
literature, and experiments conducted with porcine tissue, (iii) designing the
communication framework with safety considerations, and analyzing the influence
of different network and hardware parameters such as transmission frequency and
electrode placements. Our results reveal a close agreement between theory,
simulation, literature and experimental findings, pointing to the suitability
of the model for quick and accurate channel characterization and parameter
estimation for networked and implanted sensors."
"Qutrit (or ternary) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems,
particularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient
circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the
derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely
ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the
binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to
higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set.
Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only
$1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than
previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth
of only $O(\log\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on
two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic
circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of
non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections
further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the
non-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\rangle \mapsto |i, j + \delta_{i,2} \mod
3\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate
$P_9=\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \pi \, i/9},1,e^{2 \pi \, i/9})$. The two choices of
elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different
prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and
the supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to
factor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary
finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be
implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis."
"We present a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called
Requp, which supports a hierarchical approach to mapping a quantum algorithm
while sharing physical and logical ancilla qubits. Each core is capable of
performing any quantum instruction. Moreover, we introduce a scalable quantum
mapper, called Squash 2, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of
quantum modules---each module is divided into k parts such that each part will
run on one of k available cores. Experimental results demonstrate that Squash~2
can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while providing an effective
mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits."
"We demonstrate a low-power and compact hardware implementation of Random
Feature Extractor (RFE) core. With complex tasks like Image Recognition
requiring a large set of features, we show how weight reuse technique can allow
to virtually expand the random features available from RFE core. Further, we
show how to avoid computation cost wasted for propagating ""incognizant"" or
redundant random features. For proof of concept, we validated our approach by
using our RFE core as the first stage of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)--a two
layer neural network--and were able to achieve $>97\%$ accuracy on MNIST
database of handwritten digits. ELM's first stage of RFE is done on an analog
ASIC occupying $5$mm$\times5$mm area in $0.35\mu$m CMOS and consuming $5.95$
$\mu$J/classify while using $\approx 5000$ effective hidden neurons. The ELM
second stage consisting of just adders can be implemented as digital circuit
with estimated power consumption of $20.9$ nJ/classify. With a total energy
consumption of only $5.97$ $\mu$J/classify, this low-power mixed signal ASIC
can act as a co-processor in portable electronic gadgets with cameras."
"Actin is a globular protein which forms long polar filaments in eukaryotic.
The actin filaments play roles of cytoskeleton, motility units , information
processing and learning. We model actin filament as a double chain of finite
state machines, nodes, which take states `0' and `1'. The states are
abstractions of absence and presence of a sub-threshold charge on an actin
units corresponding to the nodes. All nodes update their state in parallel in
discrete time. A node updates its current state depending on states of two
closest neighbours in the node chain and two closest neighbours in the
complementary chain. Previous models of actin automata considered momentary
state transitions of nodes. We enrich the actin automata model by assuming that
states of nodes depends not only on the current states of neighbouring node but
also on their past states. Thus, we assess the effect of memory of past states
on the dynamics of acting automata. We demonstrate in computational experiments
that memory slows down propagation of perturbations, decrease entropy of
space-time patterns generated, transforms travelling localisations to
stationary oscillators, and stationary oscillations to still patterns."
"The idea behind universal coating is to have a thin layer of a specific
substance covering an object of any shape so that one can measure a certain
condition (like temperature or cracks) at any spot on the surface of the object
without requiring direct access to that spot. We study the universal coating
problem in the context of self-organizing programmable matter consisting of
simple computational elements, called particles, that can establish and release
bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way. Based on that matter, we
present a worst-case work-optimal universal coating algorithm that uniformly
coats any object of arbitrary shape and size that allows a uniform coating. Our
particles are anonymous, do not have any global information, have constant-size
memory, and utilize only local interactions."
"Magnetic domain-wall (DW) has been widely investigated for future memory and
computing systems. However, energy efficiency and stability become two major
challenges of DW-based systems. In this letter, we first propose exploiting
skyrmions as on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for DW-based systems, owing
to the topological stability, small size and ultra-low depinning current
density. In the proposed technique, data are processed in the form of DWs but
are transmitted instead in the form of skyrmions. The reversible conversion
between a skyrmion and a DW pair can be physically achieved by connecting a
wide and a narrow magnetic nanowire. Our proposed technique can realize highly
compact, robust and energy-efficient on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for
DW-based systems, enabling the system to take advantages of both the DW and
skyrmion."
"Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) access points (APs) using 60 GHz unlicensed
frequency band are considered as key enablers for future Gbps WLANs. Due to its
short range transmission with high susceptibility to path blocking, a multiple
number of WiGig APs should be installed to fully cover a typical target
environment. However, using autonomously operated WiGig APs with IEEE 802.11ad
DCF, the exhaustive search analog beamforming and the maximum received power
based autonomous users association prevent the establishment of optimal WiGig
concurrent links that maximize the total system throughput in random access
scenarios. In this paper, we formulate the problem of WiGig concurrent
transmissions in random access scenarios as an optimization problem, then we
propose a Wi-Fi/WiGig coordination architecture to solve it. The proposed
coordinated Wi-Fi/WiGig WLAN is based on a tight coordination between the 5 GHz
(Wi-Fi) and the 60 GHz (WiGig) unlicensed frequency bands. By which, the wide
coverage Wi-Fi band controls the establishment of the WiGig concurrent links.
Statistical learning using Wi-Fi fingerprinting is used for estimating the best
candidate AP and its best beam identification (ID) for establishing the WiGig
concurrent link without making any interference to the existing WiGig data
links."
"Chemical algorithms are statistical algorithms described and represented as
chemical reaction networks. They are particularly attractive for traffic
shaping and general control of network dynamics; they are analytically
tractable, they reinforce a strict state-to-dynamics relationship, they have
configurable stability properties, and they are directly implemented in
state-space using a high-level (graphical) representation.
  In this paper, we present a direct implementation of chemical algorithms on
FPGA hardware. Besides substantially improving performance, we have achieved
hardware-level programmability and re-configurability of these algorithms at
runtime (not interrupting servicing) and in realtime (with sub-second latency).
This opens an interesting perspective for expanding the currently limited scope
of software defined networking and network virtualisation solutions, to include
programmable control of network dynamics."
"We report simulation of nanostructured memristor device using piecewise
linear and nonlinear window functions for RRAM and neuromorphic applications.
The linear drift model of memristor has been exploited for the simulation
purpose with the linear and non-linear window function as the mathematical and
scripting basis. The results evidences that the piecewise linear window
function can aptly simulate the memristor characteristics pertaining to RRAM
application. However, the nonlinear window function could exhibit the nonlinear
phenomenon in simulation only at the lower magnitude of control parameter. This
has motivated us to propose a new nonlinear window function for emulating the
simulation model of the memristor. Interestingly, the proposed window function
is scalable up to f(x)=1 and exhibits the nonlinear behavior at higher
magnitude of control parameter. Moreover, the simulation results of proposed
nonlinear window function are encouraging and reveals the smooth nonlinear
change from LRS to HRS and vice versa and therefore useful for the neuromorphic
applications."
"We present a construction, rendered in Quipper, of a quantum algorithm which
probabilistically computes a classical function from n bits to n bits. The
construction is intended to be of interest primarily for the features of
Quipper it highlights. However, intrigued by the utility of quantum information
processing in the context of neural networks, we present the algorithm as a
simplest example of a particular quantum neural network which we first define.
As the definition is inspired by recent work of Fisher concerning possible
quantum substrates to cognition, we precede it with a short description of that
work."
"We report optimal and asymptotically optimal reversible circuits composed of
NOT, CNOT, and Toffoli (NCT) gates, keeping the count by the subsets of the
gate types used. This study fine tunes the circuit complexity figures for the
realization of reversible functions via reversible NCT circuits. An important
consequence is a result on the limitation of the use of the $T$-count quantum
circuit metric popular in applications."
"The present paper investigates state space analysis of memristor based series
and parallel RLCM circuits. The stability analysis is carried out with the help
of eigenvalues formulation method, pole-zero plot and transient response of
system. The state space analysis is successfully applied and eigenvalues of the
two circuits are calculated. It is found that the, system follows negative real
part of eigenvalues. The result clearly shows that addition of memristor in
circuits will not alter the stability of system. It is found that systems poles
located at left hand side of the S plane, which indicates stable performance of
system. It clearly evident that eigenvalues has negative real part hence two
systems are internally stable."
"It is well-known that the Toffoli gate and the negation gate together yield a
universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: If $A$ is a
finite set of odd cardinality then a finite gate set can generate all
permutations of $A^n$ for all $n$, without any auxiliary symbols. If the
cardinality of $A$ is even then, by the same argument as above, only even
permutations of $A^n$ can be implemented for large $n$, and we show that indeed
all even permutations can be obtained from a finite universal gate set. We also
consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$ that
preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that records
how many times each symbol occurs in the word. It turns out that no finite
conservative gate set can, for all $n$, implement all conservative even
permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits. But we provide a finite gate set
that can implement all those conservative permutations that are even within
each weight class of $A^n$."
"Magnetic skyrmion holds promise as information carriers in the
next-generation memory and logic devices, owing to the topological stability,
small size and extremely low current needed to drive it. One of the most
potential applications of skyrmion is to design racetrack memory (RM), named
Sk-RM, instead of utilizing domain wall (DW). However, current studies face
some key design challenges, e.g., skyrmion manipulation, data representation
and synchronization etc. To address these challenges, we propose here a
complementary Sk-RM structure with voltage manipulation. Functionality and
performance of the proposed design are investigated with micromagnetic
simulations."
"A general methodology is proposed to engineer a system of interacting
components (particles) which is able to self-regulate their concentrations in
order to produce any prescribed output in response to a particular input. The
methodology is based on the mathematical equivalence between artificial neurons
in neural networks and species in autocatalytic reactions, and it specifies the
relationship between the artificial neural network's parameters and the rate
coefficients of the reactions between particle species. Such systems are
characterised by a high degree of robustness as they are able to reach the
desired output despite disturbances and perturbations of the concentrations of
the various species."
"The generation of reversible circuits from high-level code is in important
problem in several application domains, including low-power electronics and
quantum computing. Existing tools compile and optimize reversible circuits for
various metrics, such as the overall circuit size or the total amount of space
required to implement a given function reversibly. However, little effort has
been spent on verifying the correctness of the results, an issue of particular
importance in quantum computing. There, compilation allows not only mapping to
hardware, but also the estimation of resources required to implement a given
quantum algorithm. This resource determination is crucial for identifying which
algorithms will outperform their classical counterparts. We present a
reversible circuit compiler called ReVer, which has been formally verified in
F* and compiles circuits that operate correctly with respect to the input
program. Our compiler compiles the Revs language to combinational reversible
circuits with as few ancillary bits as possible, and provably cleans temporary
values."
"Research toward powerful information processing systems that circumvent the
interconnect bottleneck by exploiting the nonlinear evolution of multiple phase
dynamics in locally connected arrays is discussed. We focus on a scheme in
which logic states are defined by the electrical phase of a dynamic process and
information processing is realized through interactions between the elements in
the array. Simulation results are given for networks comprised of neuron-like
integrate-and-fire elements, which could potentially be implemented by
ultra-small tunnel junctions, molecules and other types of nanoscale elements.
This approach could lead to powerful information processing systems due to
massive parallelism in simple, highly scalable nano-architectures. The rational
for this approach, its advantages, simulation results, critical issues, and
future research directions are discussed."
"This paper proposes a method to completely hide the functionality of a
digital standard cell. This is accomplished by a differential threshold logic
gate (TLG). A TLG with $n$ inputs implements a subset of Boolean functions of
$n$ variables that are linear threshold functions. The output of such a gate is
one if and only if an integer weighted linear arithmetic sum of the inputs
equals or exceeds a given integer threshold. We present a novel architecture of
a TLG that not only allows a single TLG to implement a large number of complex
logic functions, which would require multiple levels of logic when implemented
using conventional logic primitives, but also allows the selection of that
subset of functions by assignment of the transistor threshold voltages to the
input transistors. To obfuscate the functionality of the TLG, weights of some
inputs are set to zero by setting their device threshold to be a high $V_t$.
The threshold voltage of the remaining transistors is set to low $V_t$ to
increase their transconductance. The function of a TLG is not determined by the
cell itself but rather the signals that are connected to its inputs. This makes
it possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing
some variable from the support set of the function by selective assignment of
high and low $V_t$ to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell
library of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize
complex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse
engineering. A 32-bit Wallace tree multiplier and a 28-bit 4-tap filter were
synthesized on an ST 65nm process, placed and routed, then simulated including
extracted parastics with and without obfuscation. Both obfuscated designs had
much lower area (25%) and much lower dynamic power (30%) than their
nonobfuscated CMOS counterparts, operating at the same frequency."
"We study the problem of compilation of quantum algorithms into optimized
physical-level circuits executable in a quantum information processing (QIP)
experiment based on trapped atomic ions. We report a complete strategy:
starting with an algorithm in the form of a quantum computer program, we
compile it into a high-level logical circuit that goes through multiple stages
of decomposition into progressively lower-level circuits until we reach the
physical execution-level specification. We skip the fault-tolerance layer, as
it is not within the scope of this work. The different stages are structured so
as to best assist with the overall optimization while taking into account
numerous optimization criteria, including minimizing the number of expensive
two-qubit gates, minimizing the number of less expensive single-qubit gates,
optimizing the runtime, minimizing the overall circuit error, and optimizing
classical control sequences. Our approach allows a trade-off between circuit
runtime and quantum error, as well as to accommodate future changes in the
optimization criteria that may likely arise as a result of the anticipated
improvements in the physical-level control of the experiment."
"Quantum computing is a new way of data processing based on the concept of
quantum mechanics. Quantum circuit design is a process of converting a quantum
gate to a series of basic gates and is divided into two general categories
based on the decomposition and composition. In the second group, using
evolutionary algorithms and especially genetic algorithms, multiplication of
matrix gates was used to achieve the final characteristic of quantum circuit.
Genetic programming is a subfield of evolutionary computing in which computer
programs evolve to solve studied problems. In past research that has been done
in the field of quantum circuits design, only one cost metrics (usually quantum
cost) has been investigated. In this paper for the first time, a
multi-objective approach has been provided to design quantum circuits using
genetic programming that considers the depth and the cost of nearest neighbor
metrics in addition to quantum cost metric. Another innovation of this article
is the use of two-step fitness function and taking into account the equivalence
of global phase in quantum gates. The results show that the proposed method is
able to find a good answer in a short time."
"We say that a reversible boolean function on n bits has alternation depth d
if it can be written as the sequential composition of d reversible boolean
functions, each of which acts only on the top n-1 bits or on the bottom n-1
bits. Moreover, if the functions on n-1 bits are even, we speak of even
alternation depth. We show that every even reversible boolean function of n >=
4 bits has alternation depth at most 9 and even alternation depth at most 13."
"Received signal strength based radio tomographic imaging is a popular
device-free indoor localization method which reconstructs the spatial loss
field of the environment using measurements from a dense wireless network.
Existing methods solve an associated inverse problem using algebraic or
compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms. We propose an alternative imaging
method that reconstructs spatial field of occupancy using a back-projection
based reconstruction algorithm. The introduced system has the following
advantages over the other imaging based methods: i.) significantly lower
computational complexity such that no floating point multiplication is
required; ii.) each link's measured data is compressed to a single bit,
providing improved scalability; iii.) physically significant and repeatable
parameters. The proposed method is validated using measurement data. Results
show that the proposed method achieves the above advantages without loss of
accuracy compared to the other available methods."
"This paper presents an analytical comparison of active and passive receiver
models in diffusive molecular communication. In the active model, molecules are
absorbed when they collide with the receiver surface. In the passive model, the
receiver is a virtual boundary that does not affect molecule behavior. Two
approaches are presented to derive transforms between the receiver signals. As
an example, two models for an unbounded diffusion-only molecular communication
system with a spherical receiver are unified. As time increases in the
three-dimensional system, the transform functions have constant scaling
factors, such that the receiver models are effectively equivalent. Methods are
presented to enable the transformation of stochastic simulations, which are
used to verify the transforms and demonstrate that transforming the simulation
of a passive receiver can be more efficient and more accurate than the direct
simulation of an absorbing receiver."
"In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, universal quantum computations
are performed using measurements to designated qubits in a highly entangled
state. The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of
the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum
computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the
only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However,
simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most
cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct
simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit
elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to
considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover,
our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a
generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is
called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental
results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and
EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators,
i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model."
"With current tools and technology, someone who has physical access to a chip
can extract the detailed layout of the integrated circuit (IC). By using
advanced visual imaging techniques, reverse engineering can reveal details that
are meant to be kept secret, such as a secure protocol or novel implementation
that offers a competitive advantage. A promising solution to defend against
reverse engineering attacks is IC camouflaging. In this work, we propose a new
camouflaging technique based on the threshold voltage of the transistors. We
refer to these cells as threshold dependent camouflaged cells. Our work differs
from current commercial solutions in that the latter use look-alike cells, with
the assumption that it is difficult for the reverse engineer to identify the
cell's functionality. Yet, if a structural distinction between cells exists,
then these are still vulnerable, especially as reverse engineers use more
advanced and precise techniques. On the other hand, the proposed threshold
dependent standard cells are structurally identical regardless of the cells'
functionality. Detailed circuit simulations of our proposed threshold dependent
camouflaged cells demonstrate that they can be used to cost-effectively and
robustly camouflage large netlists. Corner analysis of process, temperature,
and supply voltage (PVT) variations show that our cells operate as expected
over all PVT corners simulated."
"In this paper, we describe a compact low-power, high performance hardware
implementation of the extreme learning machine (ELM) for machine learning
applications. Mismatch in current mirrors are used to perform the vector-matrix
multiplication that forms the first stage of this classifier and is the most
computationally intensive. Both regression and classification (on UCI data
sets) are demonstrated and a design space trade-off between speed, power and
accuracy is explored. Our results indicate that for a wide set of problems,
$\sigma V_T$ in the range of $15-25$mV gives optimal results. An input weight
matrix rotation method to extend the input dimension and hidden layer size
beyond the physical limits imposed by the chip is also described. This allows
us to overcome a major limit imposed on most hardware machine learners. The
chip is implemented in a $0.35 \mu$m CMOS process and occupies a die area of
around 5 mm $\times$ 5 mm. Operating from a $1$ V power supply, it achieves an
energy efficiency of $0.47$ pJ/MAC at a classification rate of $31.6$ kHz."
"The statistical-physics-based Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key exchange
offers a new and simple unclonable system for credit/debit card chip
authentication and payment. The key exchange, the authentication and the
communication are unconditionally secure so that neither mathematics- nor
statistics-based attacks are able to crack the scheme. The ohmic connection and
the short wiring lengths between the chips in the card and the terminal
constitute an ideal setting for the KLJN protocol, and even its simplest
versions offer unprecedented security and privacy for credit/debit card chips
and applications of physical unclonable functions."
"We determine the cost of performing Shor's algorithm for integer
factorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of
universal fault-tolerant computing:
  (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability
of the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control as
its natural instrumentation set; (ii) a model based on a metaplectic
topological quantum computer (MTQC). A natural choice to implement Shor's
algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic
into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to emulate the standard
binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three-level system.
We compare the two approaches and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's
period finding function in the two models. We also highlight the fact that the
cost of achieving universality through magic states in MTQC architecture is
asymptotically lower than in generic ternary case."
"Existing compact models for memristive devices (including RRAM and CBRAM) all
suffer from issues related to mathematical ill-posedness and/or improper
implementation. This limits their value for simulation and design and in some
cases, results in qualitatively unphysical predictions. We identify the causes
of ill-posedness in these models. We then show how memristive devices in
general can be modelled using only continuous/smooth primitives in such a way
that they always respect physical bounds for filament length and also feature
well-defined and correct DC behaviour. We show how to express these models
properly in languages like Verilog-A and ModSpec (MATLAB). We apply these
methods to correct previously published RRAM and memristor models and make them
well posed. The result is a collection of memristor models that may be dubbed
""simulation-ready"", i.e., that feature the right physical characteristics and
are suitable for robust and consistent simulation in DC, AC, transient, etc.,
analyses. We provide implementations of these models in both ModSpec/MATLAB and
Verilog-A."
"The presented work provides a procedure for optimizing the communication cost
of a distributed quantum circuit (DQC) in terms of the number of qubit
teleportations. Because of technology limitations which do not allow large
quantum computers to work as a single processing element, distributed quantum
computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty. Previous
studies have applied ad-hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for
special cases and applications. In this study, a general approach is proposed
to optimize the number of teleportations for a DQC consisting of two spatially
separated and long-distance quantum subsystems. To this end, different
configurations of locations for executing gates whose qubits are in distinct
subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations, the proposed
algorithm is run to find the minimum number of required teleportations.
Finally, the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations
is reported. The proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find
the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the DQC."
"We present a collection of results concerning the structure of reversible
gate classes over non-binary alphabets, including (1) a reversible gate class
over non-binary alphabets that is not finitely generated (2) an explicit set of
generators for the class of all gates, the class of all conservative gates, and
a class of generalizations of the two (3) an embedding of the poset of
reversible gate classes over an alphabet of size $k$ into that of an alphabet
of size $k+1$ (4) a classification of gate classes containing the class of
$(k-1,1)$-conservative gates, meaning gates that preserve the number of
occurrences of a certain element in the alphabet."
"With the advent of cheap computing through five decades of continued
miniaturization following Moores Law, wearable devices are becoming
increasingly popular. These wearable devices are typically interconnected using
wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an
alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable
devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of
magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and
broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as
the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on
unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight
applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend
request sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication
using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure
BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has
been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an
antenna. In this work, for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual
data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering (>20 dB) of the
interference for interference-robust HBC."
"This document presents a studies of the stochastic behavior of D-Wave qubits,
qubit cells, and qubit chains. The purpose of this paper is to address the
algorithmic behavior of execution rather than the physical behavior, though
they are related. The measurements from an actual D-Wave adiabatic quantum
computer are compare with calculated measurements from a theoretical adiabatic
quantum computer running with an effective temperature of zero. In this way the
paper attempts to shed light on how the D-Wave's behavior effects how well it
minimizes its objective function and why the D-Wave performs as it does."
"The D-Wave is an adiabatic quantum computer. It is an understatement to say
that it is not a traditional computer. It can be viewed as a computational
accelerator or more precisely a computational oracle, where one asks it a
relevant question and it returns a useful answer. The question is how do you
ask a relevant question and how do you use the answer it returns. This paper
addresses these issues in a way that is pertinent to machine learning. A
Boltzmann machine is implemented with the D-Wave since the D-Wave is merely a
hardware instantiation of a partially connected Boltzmann machine. This paper
presents a prototype implementation of a 3-layered neural network where the
D-Wave is used as the middle (hidden) layer of the neural network. This paper
also explains how the D-Wave can be utilized in a multi-layer neural network
(more than 3 layers) and one in which each layer may be multiple times the size
of the D-Wave being used."
"This volume constitutes the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on
Physics and Computation (PC 2016). The workshop was held on the 14th of July
2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th
International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.
  The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on
the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This
intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the
traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour
of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and
information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and,
in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of
computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems.
Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation
that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the
axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in
physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of
measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation."
"I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state
space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches
traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm. The quantum
annealing algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical
numerical technique which is now obsolete. Hence, I explore strategies to use
an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization
algorithms, and additionally should be less sensitive to problem
mis-specification then the traditional quantum annealing algorithm."
"Bio-inspired hardware holds the promise of low-energy, intelligent and highly
adaptable computing systems. Applications span from automatic classification
for big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for
bio-medical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating
bio-inspired hardware is building ultra-high density networks out of complex
processing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices
exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this
context. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions are well suited for this
purpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such
functionality, non-volatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in
unconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when
memory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic
devices that could be beneficial for bio-inspired computing include tunable
fast non-linear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single
devices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks
of interacting spintronic nano-devices can have their interactions tuned to
induce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion,
phase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states.
A number of groups have recently proposed bio-inspired architectures that
include one or several types of spintronic nanodevices. In this article we show
how spintronics can be used for bio-inspired computing. We review the different
approaches that have been proposed, the recent advances in this direction, and
the challenges towards fully integrated spintronics-CMOS (Complementary metal -
oxide - semiconductor) bio-inspired hardware."
"There is much interest in incorporating inference capabilities into
sensor-rich embedded platforms such as autonomous vehicles, wearables, and
others. A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract
information locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This
necessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical
sensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and
computational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements
of the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy
consumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in
transferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy)
and the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor
(computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing
architecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by
embedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and
retraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal
computations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a
sensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure
from the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be
designed by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in
the analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS)
array. Significant gains in energy-efficiency are demonstrated using behavioral
and energy models in a commercial semiconductor process technology. In the
process, the Compute Sensor creates a unique opportunity to develop machine
learning algorithms for information extraction from data on a noisy underlying
computational fabric."
"We analyze how the amount of work dissipated by a fixed nonequilibrium
process depends on the initial distribution over states. Specifically, we
compare the amount of dissipation when the process is used with some specified
initial distribution to the minimal amount of dissipation possible for any
initial distribution. We show that the difference between those two amounts of
dissipation is given by a simple information-theoretic function that depends
only on the initial and final state distributions. Crucially, this difference
is independent of the details of the process relating those distributions. We
then consider how dissipation depends on the initial distribution for a
'computer', i.e., a nonequilibrium process whose dynamics over coarse-grained
macrostates implement some desired input-output map. We show that our results
still apply when stated in terms of distributions over the computer's
coarse-grained macrostates. This can be viewed as a novel thermodynamic cost of
computation, reflecting changes in the distribution over inputs rather than the
logical dynamics of the computation."
"Self-assembly is a process found everywhere in the Nature. In particular, it
is known that DNA self-assembly is Turing universal. Thus one can do arbitrary
computations or build nano-structures using DNA self-assembly. In order to
understand the DNA self-assembly process, many mathematical models have been
proposed in the literature. In particular, abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM)
received much attention. In this work, we investigate pixel pattern generation
using aTAM. For a given image, a tile assembly system is given which can
generate the image by self-assembly process. We also consider image blocks with
specific cyclic pixel patterns (uniform shift and non uniform shift) self
assembly. A software, DNA Image Pro, for generating pixel patterns using DNA
tile assembly is also given."
"As capacity and complexity of on-chip cache memory hierarchy increases, the
service cost to the critical loads from Last Level Cache (LLC), which are
frequently repeated, has become a major concern. The processor may stall for a
considerable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache
blocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide
accelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this work
concentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing
SRAM-based L2 with Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) to
accommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of
reducing the overall read service time. Our proposed technique partitions L2
cache into two STT-RAM arrangements with different write performance and data
retention time. The retention-relaxed STT-RAM arrays are utilized to
effectively deal with the regular L2 cache requests while the high retention
STT-RAM arrays in L2 are selected for maintaining repeatedly read accessed
cache blocks from LLC by incurring negligible energy consumption for data
retention. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce
the mean L2 read miss ratio by 51.4% and increase the IPC by 11.7% on average
across PARSEC benchmark suite while significantly decreasing the total L2
energy consumption compared to conventional SRAM-based L2 design."
"Whereas contemporary Error Correcting Codes (ECC) designs occupy a
significant fraction of total die area in chip-multiprocessors (CMPs),
approaches to deal with the vulnerability increase of CMP architecture against
Single Event Upsets (SEUs) and Multi-Bit Upsets (MBUs) are sought. In this
paper, we focus on reliability assessment of multithreaded applications running
on CMPs to propose an adaptive application-relevant architecture design to
accommodate the impact of both SEUs and MBUs in the entire CMP architecture.
This work concentrates on leveraging the intrinsic soft-error-immunity feature
of Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) as an alternative for SRAM-based storage
and operation components. We target a specific portion of working set for
reallocation to improve the reliability level of the CMP architecture design. A
selected portion of instructions in multithreaded program which experience high
rate of referencing with the lowest memory modification are ideal candidate to
be stored and executed in STT-RAM based components. We argue about why we
cannot use STT-RAM for the global storage and operation counterparts and
describe the obtained resiliency compared to the baseline setup. In addition, a
detail study of the impact of SEUs and MBUs on multithreaded programs will be
presented in the Appendix."
"A reversible logic has application in quantum computing. A reversible logic
design needs resources such as ancilla and garbage qubits to reconfigure
circuit functions or gate functions. The removal of garbage qubits and ancilla
qubits are essential in designing an efficient quantum circuit. In the
literature, there are multiple designs that have been proposed for a reversible
multiplication operation. A multiplication hardware is essential for the
circuit design of quantum algorithms, quantum cryptanalysis, and digital signal
processing (DSP) applications. The existing designs of reversible quantum
integer multipliers suffer from redundant garbage qubits. In this work, we
propose a reversible logic based, garbage-free and ancilla qubit optimized
design of a quantum integer multiplier. The proposed quantum integer multiplier
utilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a
reversible computing paradigm. The proposed design methodology is the modified
version of a conventional shift and add method. The proposed design of the
quantum integer multiplier incorporates add or no operation based on multiplier
qubits and followed by a rotate right operation. The proposed design of the
quantum integer multiplier produces zero garbage qubits and shows an
improvement ranging from 60% to 90% in ancilla qubits count over the existing
work on reversible quantum integer multipliers."
"Difference sets are basic combinatorial structures that have applications in
signal processing, coding theory, and cryptography. We consider the problem of
identifying a shifted version of the characteristic function of a (known)
difference set. We present a generic quantum algorithm that can be used to
tackle any hidden shift problem for any difference set in any abelian group. We
discuss special cases of this framework where the resulting quantum algorithm
is efficient. This includes: a) Paley difference sets based on quadratic
residues in finite fields, which allows to recover the shifted Legendre
function quantum algorithm, b) Hadamard difference sets, which allows to
recover the shifted bent function quantum algorithm, and c) Singer difference
sets based on finite geometries. The latter class allows us to define instances
of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem that can be efficiently solved on a
quantum computer."
"As a mathematical model of self-assembling systems, Winfree's abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM) is a remarkable platform for studying the behaviors and
powers of self-assembling systems. Capable of Turing universal computation, the
aTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed
so that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute
prescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was
shown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a
single tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set
can be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly
using that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics
modulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given
makes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key
locations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating
a directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique terminal assembly.
The question then became whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally
required. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed
systems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no
universal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This
provides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is
itself a fundamentally nondeterministic process. To achieve this result we
leverage powerful results of computational complexity hierarchies, including
tight bounds on both best and worst-case complexities of decidable languages,
to design systems with precisely controllable space resources available to
embedded computations. We also develop novel techniques for designing systems
containing subsystems with disjoint, mutually exclusive computational powers."
"Over the past decade a large family of spintronic devices have been proposed
as candidates for replacing CMOS for future digital logic circuits. Using the
recently developed Modular Approach framework, we investigate and identify the
physical bottlenecks and engineering challenges facing current spintronic
devices. We then evaluate how systematic advancements in material properties
and device design innovations impact the performance of spintronic devices, as
a possible continuation of Moore's Law, even though some of these projections
are speculative and may require technological breakthroughs. Lastly, we
illustrate the use of the Modular Approach as an exploratory tool for
probabilistic networks, using superparamagnetic magnets as building blocks for
such networks. These building blocks leverage the inherent physics of
stochastic spin-torque switching and could provide ultra-compact and efficient
hardware for beyond-Boolean computational paradigms."
"Thermodynamic RAM (kT-RAM) is a neuromemristive co-processor design based on
the theory of AHaH Computing and implemented via CMOS and memristors. The
co-processor is a 2-D array of differential memristor pairs (synapses) that can
be selectively coupled together (neurons) via the digital bit addressing of the
underlying CMOS RAM circuitry. The chip is designed to plug into existing
digital computers and be interacted with via a simple instruction set.
Anti-Hebbian and Hebbian (AHaH) computing forms the theoretical framework from
which a nature-inspired type of computing architecture is built where, unlike
von Neumann architectures, memory and processor are physically combined for
synaptic operations. Through exploitation of AHaH attractor states,
memristor-based circuits converge to attractor basins that represents machine
learning solutions such as unsupervised feature learning, supervised
classification and anomaly detection. Because kT-RAM eliminates the need to
shuttle bits back and forth between memory and processor and can operate at
very low voltage levels, it can significantly surpass CPU, GPU, and FPGA
performance for synaptic integration and learning operations. Here, we present
a memristor technology developed for use in kT-RAM, in particular
bi-directional incremental adaptation of conductance via short low-voltage 1.0
V, 1.0 microsecond pulses."
"Context awareness is increasingly gaining applicability in interactive
ubiquitous mobile computing systems. Each context-aware application has its own
set of behaviors to react to context modifications. This paper is concerned
with the context modeling and the development methodology for context-aware
systems. We proposed a rule-based approach and use the adaption tree to model
the adaption rule of context-aware systems. We illustrate this idea in an
arithmetic game application."
"RNA can be used as a high-density medium for data storage and transmission;
however, an important RNA process -- replication -- is noisy. This paper
presents an error analysis for RNA as a data transmission medium, analyzing how
deletion errors increase in a collection of replicated DNA strands over time."
"In this paper we present quaternary and ternary routing tracks for FPGAs, and
their implementation in 28nm FDSOI technology. We discuss the transistor level
design of multi-valued repeaters, multiplexers and translators, and specific
features of FDSOI technology which make it possible. Next we compare the
multi-valued routing architectures with equivalent single driver two-valued
routing architectures. We show that for long tracks, it is possible to achieve
upto 3x reduction in dynamic switching energy, upto 2x reduction in routing
wire area and 10% reduction in area dedicated to routing resources. The
multi-valued tracks are slightly more susceptible to process variation. We
present a layout method for multivalued standard cells and determine the layout
overhead.We conclude with various usage scenarios of these tracks."
"Traditional studies of memristive devices have mainly focused on their
applications in non-volatile information storage and information processing.
Here, we demonstrate that the third fundamental component of information
technologies { the transfer of information { can also be employed with
memristive devices. For this purpose, we introduce a metastable memristive
circuit. Combining metastable memristive circuits into a line, one obtains an
architecture capable of transferring a signal edge from one space location to
another. We emphasize that the suggested transmission lines employ only
resistive components. Moreover, their networks (for example, Y-connected lines)
have an information processing capability."
"Energy conservative devices are the need of the modern technology which leads
to the development of reversible logic. The synthesis of reversible logic has
become an intensely studied area as it overcomes the problem of power
dissipation associated with irreversibility. Storage device such as
Read-Only-Memory (ROM) can be realized in a reversible way with low power
dissipation. The reversibility of ROM has not been yet realized in literature
and hence, this paper presents a novel reversible ROM with its Complementary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) realization. On the way to present the
architecture of reversible ROM, we propose a new reversible gate named as
Nowrin Papiya (NP) gate. All the proposed circuits and gates are realized with
CMOS based pass transistor logic. Finally, an algorithm as well as several
theorems on the numbers of gates, transistors and garbage outputs have been
presented to show the optimality of the reversible ROM. Simulations using
Microwind DSCH software has been shown to verify the correctness of the
proposed design. The comparative results prove that the proposed designs are
efficient and optimized in terms of numbers of gates, transistors, garbage
outputs, quantum cost and delay."
"Reservoir Computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time
dependent signals. The performance of its analogue implementation are
comparable to other state of the art algorithms for tasks such as speech
recognition or chaotic time series prediction, but these are often constrained
by the offline training methods commonly employed. Here we investigated the
online learning approach by training an opto-electronic reservoir computer
using a simple gradient descent algorithm, programmed on an FPGA chip. Our
system was applied to wireless communications, a quickly growing domain with an
increasing demand for fast analogue devices to equalise the nonlinear distorted
channels. We report error rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than
previous implementations on this task. We show that our system is particularly
well-suited for realistic channel equalisation by testing it on a drifting and
a switching channels and obtaining good performances"
"Delay-coupled electro-optical systems have received much attention for their
dynamical properties and their potential use in signal processing. In
particular it has recently been demonstrated, using the artificial intelligence
algorithm known as reservoir computing, that photonic implementations of such
systems solve complex tasks such as speech recognition. Here we show how the
backpropagation algorithm can be physically implemented on the same
electro-optical delay-coupled architecture used for computation with only minor
changes to the original design. We find that, compared when the backpropagation
algorithm is not used, the error rate of the resulting computing device,
evaluated on three benchmark tasks, decreases considerably. This demonstrates
that electro-optical analog computers can embody a large part of their own
training process, allowing them to be applied to new, more difficult tasks."
"We propose an architecture based on Quantum cellular Automata which allows
the use of only one type of quantum gates per computational step in order to
perform nearest neighbor interactions. The model is built in partial steps,
each one of them analyzed using nearest neighbor interactions, starting with
single qubit operations and continuing with two qubit ones. The effectiveness
of the model is tested and valuated by developing a quantum circuit
implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform. The important outcome of this
validation was that the operations are performed in a local and controlled
manner thus reducing the error rate of each computational step."
"Adleman showed that deoxyribonucleic acid DNA strands could be employed
towards calculating solutions to an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem .
Lipton also demonstrated that Adleman techniques could be used to solve the
Satisfiability problem. In this paper, we use Adleman Lipton model for
developing a DNA algorithm to solve Maximum k-colourable Sub graph problem. In
spite of the NP-hardness of Maximum k-colourable Sub graph problem our DNA
procedures is done in a polynomial time."
"Blockchain represents a technology for establishing a shared, immutable
version of the truth between a network of participants that do not trust one
another, and therefore has the potential to disrupt any financial or other
industries that rely on third-parties to establish trust. Recent trends in
computing including: prevalence of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS); easy
access to High Performance Computing (HPC i.e. 'The Cloud'); and increasingly
advanced analytics capabilities such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Machine Learning (ML) allow for rapidly prototyping applications for analysis
of trends in the emergence of Blockchain technology. A scaleable
proof-of-concept pipeline that lays the groundwork for analysis of multiple
streams of semi-structured data posted on social media is demonstrated.
Preliminary analysis and performance metrics are presented and discussed.
Future work is described that will scale the system to cloud-based, real-time,
analysis of multiple data streams, with Information Extraction (IE) (ex.
sentiment analysis) and Machine Learning capability."
"We experimentally demonstrate classification of 4x4 binary images into 4
classes, using a 3-layer mixed-signal neuromorphic network (""MLP perceptron""),
based on two passive 20x20 memristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with
discrete CMOS components. The network features 10 hidden-layer and 4
output-layer analog CMOS neurons and 428 metal-oxide memristors, i.e. is almost
an order of magnitude more complex than any previously reported functional
memristor circuit. Moreover, the inference operation of this classifier is
performed entirely in the integrated hardware. To deal with larger crossbar
arrays, we have developed a semi-automatic approach to their forming and
testing, and compared several memristor training schemes for coping with
imperfect behavior of these devices, as well as with variability of analog CMOS
neurons. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes for defect and variation
tolerance was verified experimentally using the implemented network and,
additionally, by modeling the operation of a larger network, with 300
hidden-layer neurons, on the MNIST benchmark. Finally, we propose a simple
modification of the implemented memristor-based vector-by-matrix multiplier to
allow its operation in a wider temperature range."
"A unique set of characteristics are packed in emerging nonvolatile
reduction-oxidation (redox)-based resistive switching memories (ReRAMs) such as
their underlying stochastic switching processes alongside their intrinsic
highly nonlinear current-voltage characteristic, which in addition to known
nano-fabrication process variation make them a promising candidate for the next
generation of low-cost, low-power, tiny and secure Physically Unclonable
Functions (PUFs). This paper takes advantage of this otherwise disadvantageous
ReRAM feature using a combination of novel architectural and peripheral
circuitry. We present a physical one-way function, nonlinear resistive Physical
Unclonable Function (nrPUF), potentially applicable in variety of
cyber-physical security applications given its performance characteristics. We
experimentally verified performance of Valency Change Mechanism (VCM)-based
ReRAM in nano-fabricated crossbar arrays across multiple dies and runs. In
addition to a massive pool of Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs), using a
combination of experimental and simulation, our proposed PUF shows a
reliability of 98.67%, a uniqueness of 49.85%, a diffuseness of 49.86%, a
uniformity of 47.28%, and a bit-aliasing of 47.48%."
"We describe an implementation of Shor's quantum algorithm to factor n-bit
integers using only 2n+2 qubits. In contrast to previous space-optimized
implementations, ours features a purely Toffoli based modular multiplication
circuit. The circuit depth and the overall gate count are in O(n^3) and O(n^3
log(n)), respectively. We thus achieve the same space and time costs as
Takahashi et al., while using a purely classical modular multiplication
circuit. As a consequence, our approach evades most of the cost overheads
originating from rotation synthesis and enables testing and localization of
faults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware
implementation. Our new (in-place) constant-adder, which is used to construct
the modular multiplication circuit, uses only dirty ancilla qubits and features
a circuit size and depth in O(n log(n)) and O(n), respectively."
"The possibility of in-memory computing with volatile memristive devices,
namely, memristors requiring a power source to sustain their memory, is
demonstrated. We have adopted a hysteretic graphene-based field emission
structure as a prototype of volatile memristor, which is characterized by a
non-pinched hysteresis loop. Memristive model of the structure is developed and
used to simulate a polymorphic circuit implementing in-memory computing gates
such as the material implication. Specific regions of parameter space realizing
useful logic functions are identified. Our results are applicable to other
realizations of volatile memory devices."
"This work proposes CoMET, a fast and energy-efficient spintronics device for
logic applications. An input voltage is applied to a ferroelectric (FE)
material, in contact with a composite structure - a ferromagnet (FM) with
in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) placed on top of an intra-gate FM
interconnect with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through the
magnetoelectric (ME) effect, the input voltage nucleates a domain wall (DW) at
the input end of the PMA-FM interconnect. An applied current then rapidly
propagates the DW towards the output FE structure, where the inverse-ME effect
generates an output voltage. This voltage is propagated to the input of the
next CoMET device using a novel circuit structure that enables efficient device
cascading. The material parameters for CoMET are optimized by systematically
exploring the impact of parameter choices on device performance. Simulations on
a 7nm CoMET device show fast, low-energy operation, with a delay/energy of
98ps/68aJ for INV and 135ps/85aJ for MAJ3."
"We propose an oscillatory neural network implemented with two-dimensional
tantalum disulfide devices operating in the change density wave regime at room
temperature. An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices
connected in series. Such a cell has constant output and oscillatory states.
All cells have the same bias voltage. There is constant current flowing through
the cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias
voltage due to the electrical-field driven metal-to-insulator transition owing
to the changes in the charge density wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two
1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase where one of the devices is in the
insulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The
nearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are
resistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the On state while they
are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the Off state. The operation
of the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30x30 node
network. The results of our numerical modeling show the formation of artificial
vortexes and cellular-automata type data processing. The two-dimensional
1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of
properties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast
synchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for
both consumer electronic and defense applications."
"This paper introduces AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via
Reaction-Diffusion) version 1.0. AcCoRD is a sandbox reaction-diffusion solver
designed for the study of molecular communication systems. It uses a hybrid of
microscopic and mesoscopic simulation models that enables scalability via user
control of local accuracy. AcCoRD is developed in C as an open source command
line tool and includes utilities to process simulation output in MATLAB. The
latest code and links to user documentation can be found at
https://github.com/adamjgnoel/AcCoRD/. This paper provides an overview of
AcCoRD's design, including the motivation for developing a specialized
reaction-diffusion solver. The corresponding algorithms are presented in
detail, including the computational complexity of the microscopic and
mesoscopic models. Other novel derivations include the transition rates between
adjacent mesoscopic subvolumes of different sizes. Simulation results
demonstrate the use of AcCoRD as both an accurate reaction-diffusion solver and
one that is catered to the analysis of molecular communication systems. A link
is included to videos that demonstrate many of the simulated scenarios.
Additional insights from the simulation results include the selection of
suitable hybrid model parameters, the impact of reactive surfaces that are in
the proximity of a hybrid interface, and the size of a bounded environment that
is necessary to assume that it is unbounded. The development of AcCoRD is
ongoing, so its future direction is also discussed in order to highlight
improvements that will expand its potential areas of application. New features
that are being planned at the time of writing include a fluid flow model and
more complex actor behavior."
"A major hurdle to the deployment of quantum linear systems algorithms and
recent quantum simulation algorithms lies in the difficulty to find inexpensive
reversible circuits for arithmetic using existing hand coded methods. Motivated
by recent advances in reversible logic synthesis, we synthesize arithmetic
circuits using classical design automation flows and tools. The combination of
classical and reversible logic synthesis enables the automatic design of large
components in reversible logic starting from well-known hardware description
languages such as Verilog. As a prototype example for our approach we
automatically generate high quality networks for the reciprocal $1/x$, which is
necessary for quantum linear systems algorithms."
"Large-scale integration of emerging nanoscale non-volatile memory devices,
e.g. resistive random-access memory (RRAM), can enable a new generation of
neuromorphic computers that can solve a wide range of machine learning
problems. Such hybrid CMOS-RRAM neuromorphic architectures will result in
several orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption at a very small
form factor, and herald autonomous learning machines capable of self-adapting
to their environment. However, the progress in this area has been impeded from
the realization that the actual memory devices fall well short of their
expected behavior. In this work, we discuss the challenges associated with
these memory devices and their use in neuromorphic computing circuits, and
propose pathways to overcome these limitations by introducing 'dendritic
learning'."
"A spin wave majority fork-like structure with feature size of 40\,nm, is
presented and investigated, through micromagnetic simulations. The structure
consists of three merging out-of-plane magnetization spin wave buses and four
magneto-electric cells serving as three inputs and an output. The information
of the logic signals is encoded in the phase of the transmitted spin waves and
subsequently stored as direction of magnetization of the magneto-electric cells
upon detection. The minimum dimensions of the structure that produce an
operational majority gate are identified. For all input combinations, the
detection scheme employed manages to capture the majority phase result of the
spin wave interference and ignore all reflection effects induced by the
geometry of the structure."
"We propose to use Digital Memcomputing Machines (DMMs), implemented with
self-organizing logic gates (SOLGs), to solve the problem of numerical
inversion. Starting from fixed-point scalar inversion we describe the
generalization to solving linear systems and matrix inversion. This method,
when realized in hardware, will output the result in only one computational
step. As an example, we perform simulations of the scalar case using a 5-bit
logic circuit made of SOLGs, and show that the circuit successfully performs
the inversion. Our method can be extended efficiently to any level of
precision, since we prove that producing n-bit precision in the output requires
extending the circuit by at most n bits. This type of numerical inversion can
be implemented by DMM units in hardware, it is scalable, and thus of great
benefit to any real-time computing application."
"The user equilibrium traffic assignment principle is very important in the
traffic assignment problem. Mathematical programming models are designed to
solve the user equilibrium problem in traditional algorithms. Recently, the
Physarum shows the ability to address the user equilibrium and system
optimization traffic assignment problems. However, the Physarum model are not
efficient in real traffic networks with two-way traffic characteristics and
multiple origin-destination pairs. In this article, a modified
Physarum-inspired model for the user equilibrium problem is proposed. By
decomposing traffic flux based on origin nodes, the traffic flux from different
origin-destination pairs can be distinguished in the proposed model. The
Physarum can obtain the equilibrium traffic flux when no shorter path can be
discovered between each origin-destination pair. Finally, numerical examples
use the Sioux Falls network to demonstrate the rationality and convergence
properties of the proposed model."
"Featuring low heat dissipation, devices based on spin-wave logic gates
promise to comply with increasing future requirements in information
processing. In this work, we present the experimental realization of a majority
gate based on the interference of spin waves in an Yttrium-Iron-Garnet-based
waveguiding structure. This logic device features a three-input combiner with
the logic information encoded in the phase of the spin waves. We show that the
phase of the output signal represents the majority of the phase of the input
signals. A switching time of about 10 ns in the prototype device provides
evidence for the ability of sub-nanosecond data processing in future
down-scaled devices."
"Touch sensing, as a major human/machine interface, is widely used in various
commercial products such as smart watches, mobile phones, tablets and TVs.
State-of-the-art touch detections are mainly based on mutual capacitive
sensing, which requires necessary contact-touch, limiting the mobile user
experience. Recently, remote gesture sensing is widely reported in both academy
and industry as it can provide additional user-experience for mobile interface.
The capacitive remote gesture sensing is mainly based on detecting
self-capacitance, achieving high resolution through eliminating the parasitic
mutual capacitance. In this work, we overview the different generations of
touchscreen technology, comparing the touch and remote gesture sensing
technologies difference. In addition, different remote gesture sensing
technologies are also compared. The limitations and potentials of different
topologies are discussed and a final conclusion about the technology trends is
summarized in the end."
"Today's unrelenting increase in demand for information processing creates the
need for novel computing concepts. Reservoir computing is such a concept that
lends itself particularly well to photonic hardware implementations. Over
recent years, these hardware implementations have gained maturity and now
achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks. However,
implementations so far are essentially all based on sequential data processing,
leaving the inherent parallelism of photonics unexploited. Parallel
implementations process all neurons simultaneously, and therefore have the
potential of reducing computation time by a factor equal to the number of
neurons, compared to sequential architectures. Here, we report a parallel
reservoir computer that uses frequency domain multiplexing of neuron states. We
illustrate its performance on standard benchmark tasks such as nonlinear
channel equalization, the reproduction of a nonlinear 10th-order system, and
speech recognition, obtaining error rates similar to previous optical
experiments. The present experiment is thus an important step towards high
speed, low footprint, all optical photonic information processing."
"We consider programmable matter that consists of computationally limited
devices (which we call particles) that are able to self-organize in order to
achieve some collective goal without the need for central control or external
intervention. We use the geometric amoebot model to describe such
self-organizing particle systems, which defines how particles can actively move
and establish or release bonds with one another. Under this model, we
investigate the feasibility of solving fundamental problems relevant to
programmable matter. In this paper, we present an efficient local-control
algorithm which solves the leader election problem in O(n) asynchronous rounds
with high probability, where n is the number of particles in the system. Our
algorithm relies only on local information (e.g., particles do not have unique
identifiers, any knowledge of n, or any sort of global coordinate system), and
requires only constant memory per particle."
"As diminishing feature sizes drive down the energy for computations, the
power budget for on-chip communication is steadily rising. Furthermore, the
increasing number of cores is placing a huge performance burden on the
network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. While NoCs are designed as regular
architectures that allow scaling to hundreds of cores, the lack of a flexible
topology gives rise to higher latencies, lower throughput, and increased energy
costs. In this paper, we explore MorphoNoCs - scalable, configurable, hybrid
NoCs obtained by extending regular electrical networks with configurable
nanophotonic links. In order to design MorphoNoCs, we first carry out a
detailed study of the design space for Multi-Write Multi-Read (MWMR)
nanophotonics links. After identifying optimum design points, we then discuss
the router architecture for deploying them in hybrid electronic-photonic NoCs.
We then study explore the design space at the network level, by varying the
waveguide lengths and the number of hybrid routers. This affords us to carry
out energy-latency trade-offs. For our evaluations, we adopt traces from
synthetic benchmarks as well as the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Our results
indicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3.0x or
energy improvements of up to 1.37x over the base electronic network."
"High-performance computing systems are moving toward 2.5D memory hierarchies,
based on High-bandwidth memory (HBM) and Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) to mitigate
the main memory bottlenecks. This trend is also creating new opportunities to
revisit near-memory computation. In this paper, we propose a flexible
processor-in-memory (PIM) solution for scalable and energy-efficient execution
of deep convolutional networks (ConvNets), one of the fastest-growing workloads
for servers and high-end embedded systems. Our co-design approach consists of a
network of Smart Memory Cubes (modular extensions to the standard HMC) each
augmented with a manycore PIM platform called NeuroCluster. NeuroClusters have
a modular design based on NeuroStream co-processors (for Convolution-intensive
computations) and general-purpose RISCV cores. In addition, a DRAM-friendly
tiling mechanism and a scalable computation paradigm are presented to
efficiently harness this computational capability with a very low programming
effort. NeuroCluster occupies only 8% of the total logic-base (LoB) die area in
a standard HMC and achieves an average performance of 240 GFLOPS for complete
execution of full-featured state-of-the-art (SoA) ConvNets within a power
budget of 2.5 W. Overall 11 W is consumed in a single SMC device, with 22.5
GFLOPS/W energy-efficiency which is 3.5X better than the best GPU
implementations in similar technologies. The minor increase in system-level
power and the negligible area increase make our PIM system a cost-effective and
energy efficient solution, easily scalable to 955 GFLOPS with a small network
of just four SMCs."
"The massive parallel approach of neuromorphic circuits leads to effective
methods for solving complex problems. It has turned out that resistive
switching devices with a continuous resistance range are potential candidates
for such applications. These devices are memristive systems - nonlinear
resistors with memory. They are fabricated in nanotechnology and hence
parameter spread during fabrication may aggravate reproducible analyses. This
issue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile.
  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model of the device
can be used to understand the underlying physical and chemical phenomena.
However, such simulations are very time-consuming and neither convenient for
investigations of whole circuits nor for real-time applications, e.g. emulation
purposes. Instead, a concentrated model of the device can be used for both fast
simulations and real-time applications, respectively. We introduce an enhanced
electrical model of a valence change mechanism (VCM) based double barrier
memristive device (DBMD) with a continuous resistance range. This device
consists of an ultra-thin memristive layer sandwiched between a tunnel barrier
and a Schottky-contact. The introduced model leads to very fast simulations by
using usual circuit simulation tools while maintaining physically meaningful
parameters.
  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model and experimental
data have been utilized as references to verify the concentrated model."
"We run a selection of algorithms on two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum
computers that are based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly
accessible superconducting transmon device with limited connectivity, and the
other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have
different native quantum interactions, both can be programmed in a way that is
blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing the first comparison of
identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that
quantum algorithms and circuits that employ more connectivity clearly benefit
from a better connected system of qubits. While the quantum systems here are
not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes
critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and
gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that co-designing
particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in
successfully using quantum computers in the future."
"The Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm utilizes a dynamical system, i.e., a
reservoir, and a linear classifier, i.e., a read-out layer, to process data
from sequential classification tasks. In this paper the usage of Cellular
Automata (CA) as a reservoir is investigated. The use of CA in RC has been
showing promising results. In this paper, selected state-of-the-art experiments
are reproduced. It is shown that some CA-rules perform better than others, and
the reservoir performance is improved by increasing the size of the CA
reservoir itself. In addition, the usage of parallel loosely coupled
CA-reservoirs, where each reservoir has a different CA-rule, is investigated.
The experiments performed on quasi-uniform CA reservoir provide valuable
insights in CA reservoir design. The results herein show that some rules do not
work well together, while other combinations work remarkably well. This
suggests that non-uniform CA could represent a powerful tool for novel CA
reservoir implementations."
"This paper presents a stochastic logic time delay reservoir design. The
reservoir is analyzed using a number of metrics, such as kernel quality,
generalization rank, performance on simple benchmarks, and is also compared to
a deterministic design. A novel re-seeding method is introduced to reduce the
adverse effects of stochastic noise, which may also be implemented in other
stochastic logic reservoir computing designs, such as echo state networks.
Benchmark results indicate that the proposed design performs well on
noise-tolerant classification problems, but more work needs to be done to
improve the stochastic logic time delay reservoir's robustness for regression
problems."
"Transactive or market-based coordination strategies have recently been
proposed for controlling the aggregate demand of a large number of electric
loads. Such schemes offer operational benefits such as enforcing distribution
feeder capacity limits and providing users with flexibility to consume energy
based on the price they are willing to pay. However, this paper demonstrates
that they are also prone to load synchronization and power oscillations. A
transactive energy framework has been adopted and applied to a population of
thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). A modified TCL switching logic takes
into account market coordination signals, alongside the natural
hysteresis-based switching conditions. Studies of this market-based
coordination scheme suggest that several factors may contribute to load
synchronism, including sharp changes in the market prices that are broadcast to
loads, lack of diversity in user specified bid curves, low feeder limits that
are encountered periodically, and the form of user bid curves. Case studies
illustrate challenges associated with market-based coordination strategies and
provide insights into modifications that address those issues."
"Neuromorphic computing using post-CMOS technologies is gaining immense
popularity due to its promising abilities to address the memory and power
bottlenecks in von-Neumann computing systems. In this paper, we propose RESPARC
- a reconfigurable and energy efficient architecture built-on Memristive
Crossbar Arrays (MCA) for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Prior works were
primarily focused on device and circuit implementations of SNNs on crossbars.
RESPARC advances this by proposing a complete system for SNN acceleration and
its subsequent analysis. RESPARC utilizes the energy-efficiency of MCAs for
inner-product computation and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design to
incorporate the data-flow patterns in an SNN in a scalable fashion. We evaluate
the proposed architecture on different SNNs ranging in complexity from 2k-230k
neurons and 1.2M-5.5M synapses. Simulation results on these networks show that
compared to the baseline digital CMOS architecture, RESPARC achieves 500X (15X)
efficiency in energy benefits at 300X (60X) higher throughput for multi-layer
perceptrons (deep convolutional networks). Furthermore, RESPARC is a
technology-aware architecture that maps a given SNN topology to the most
optimized MCA size for the given crossbar technology."
"A critical analysis of the feasibility of reversible computing is performed.
The key question is: Is it possible to build a completely reversible computer?
A closer look into the internal aspects of the reversible computing as well as
the external constraints such as the second law of thermodynamics has
demonstrated that several difficulties would have to be solved before
reversible computer is being built. It is shown that a conventional reversible
computer would require energy for setting up the reversible inputs from
irreversible signals, for the reading out of the reversible outputs, for the
transport of the information between logic elements and finally for the control
signals that will require more energy dissipating into the environment. A loose
bound on the minimum amount of energy required to be dissipated during the
physical implementation of a reversible computer is obtained and a
generalization of the principles for reversible computing is provided."
"In this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer
circuits introduced by Aaronson and Gottesman in {\it Phys. Rev. A 70(052328)},
2004. In particular, we reduce their 11-stage computation
-H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- into an 8-stage computation of the form
-H-C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the
-C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a shorter layered
expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement
compared to the -C- stages. Relying on the 8-stage decomposition we develop a
two-qubit depth-$(14n-4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate
library {P,H,CNOT}, executable in the LNN architecture, improving best
previously known depth-$25n$ circuit, also executable in the LNN architecture.
Our constructions rely on folding arbitrarily long sequences $($-P-C-$)^m$ into
a 3-stage computation -P-CZ-C-, as well as efficient implementation of the -CZ-
stage circuits."
"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been a prominent concept within
artificial intelligence. They are inspired by Biological Neural Networks (BNNs)
and provide an intuitive and abstract representation of how BNNs work. Derived
from the more generic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the recurrent ones are
meant to be used for temporal tasks, such as speech recognition, because they
are capable of memorizing historic input. However, such networks are very time
consuming to train as a result of their inherent nature. Recently, Echo State
Networks and Liquid State Machines have been proposed as possible RNN
alternatives, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RCs are far more easy
to train. In this paper, Cellular Automata are used as reservoir, and are
tested on the 5-bit memory task (a well known benchmark within the RC
community). The work herein provides a method of mapping binary inputs from the
task onto the automata, and a recurrent architecture for handling the
sequential aspects of it. Furthermore, a layered (deep) reservoir architecture
is proposed. Performances are compared towards earlier work, in addition to its
single-layer version. Results show that the single CA reservoir system yields
similar results to state-of-the-art work. The system comprised of two layered
reservoirs do show a noticeable improvement compared to a single CA reservoir.
This indicates potential for further research and provides valuable insight on
how to design CA reservoir systems."
"The prediction made by L. O. Chua 45+ years ago (see: IEEE Trans. Circuit
Theory (1971) 18:507-519 and also: Proc. IEEE (2012) 100:1920-1927) about the
existence of a passive circuit element (called memristor) that links the charge
and flux variables has been confirmed by the HP lab group in its report (see:
Nature (2008) 453:80-83) on a successful construction of such an element. This
sparked an enormous interest in mem-elements, analysis of their unusual
dynamical properties (i.e. pinched hysteresis loops, memory effects, etc.) and
construction of their emulators. Such topics are also of interest in mechanical
engineering where memdampers (or memory dampers) play the role equivalent to
memristors in electronic circuits. In this paper we discuss certain properties
of the oscillatory memristive circuits, including those with mixed-mode
oscillations. Mathematical models of such circuits can be linked to the
Newton's law $\phi''\!-\!F(t,\phi,\phi')/m=0$, with $\phi$ denoting the flux or
charge variables, $m$ is a positive constant and the nonlinear non-autonomous
function $F(t,\phi,\phi')$ contains memory terms. This leads further to scalar
fourth-order ODEs called the jounce Newtonian equations. The jounce equations
are used to construct the $RC$+op-amp simulation circuits in SPICE. Also, the
linear parallel $G$-$C$ and series $R$-$L$ circuits with sinusoidal inputs are
derived to match the $rms$ values of the memristive periodic circuits."
"In this paper, we consider the strict self-assembly of fractals in one of the
most well-studied models of tile based self-assembling systems known as the
Two-handed Tile Assembly Model (2HAM). We are particularly interested in a
class of fractals called discrete self-similar fractals (a class of fractals
that includes the discrete Sierpinski's carpet). We present a 2HAM system that
strictly self-assembles the discrete Sierpinski's carpet with scale factor 1.
Moreover, the 2HAM system that we give lends itself to being generalized and we
describe how this system can be modified to obtain a 2HAM system that strictly
self-assembles one of any fractal from an infinite set of fractals which we
call 4-sided fractals. The 2HAM systems we give in this paper are the first
examples of systems that strictly self-assemble discrete self-similar fractals
at scale factor 1 in a purely growth model of self-assembly. Finally, we give
an example of a 3-sided fractal (which is not a tree fractal) that cannot be
strictly self-assembled by any 2HAM system."
"This paper presents an extension of the BrainScaleS accelerated analog
neuromorphic hardware model. The scalable neuromorphic architecture is extended
by the support for multi-compartment models and non-linear dendrites. These
features are part of a \SI{65}{\nano\meter} prototype ASIC. It allows to
emulate different spike types observed in cortical pyramidal neurons: NMDA
plateau potentials, calcium and sodium spikes. By replicating some of the
structures of these cells, they can be configured to perform coincidence
detection within a single neuron. Built-in plasticity mechanisms can modify not
only the synaptic weights, but also the dendritic synaptic composition to
efficiently train large multi-compartment neurons. Transistor-level simulations
demonstrate the functionality of the analog implementation and illustrate
analogies to biological measurements."
"A significant hurdle towards realization of practical and scalable quantum
computing is to protect the quantum states from inherent noises during the
computation. In physical implementation of quantum circuits, a long-distance
interaction between two qubits is undesirable since, it can be interpreted as a
noise. Therefore, multiple quantum technologies and quantum error correcting
codes strongly require the interacting qubits to be arranged in a nearest
neighbor (NN) fashion. The current literature on converting a given quantum
circuit to an NN-arranged one mainly considered chained qubit topologies or
Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) topology. However, practical quantum circuit
realizations, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), may not have an LNN
topology. To address this gap, we consider an arbitrary qubit topology. We
present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for achieving minimal
logical depth while guaranteeing the nearest neighbor arrangement between the
interacting qubits. We substantiate our claim with studies on diverse network
topologies and prominent quantum circuit benchmarks."
"Searching large databases is an important problem with broad applications.
The Grover search algorithm provides a powerful method for quantum computers to
perform searches with a quadratic speedup in the number of required database
queries over classical computers. It is an optimal search algorithm for a
quantum computer, and has further applications as a subroutine for other
quantum algorithms. Searches with two qubits have been demonstrated on a
variety of platforms and proposed for others, but larger search spaces have
only been demonstrated on a non-scalable NMR system. Here, we report results
for a complete three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the scalable quantum
computing technology of trapped atomic ions, with better-than-classical
performance. The algorithm is performed for all 8 possible single-result
oracles and all 28 possible two-result oracles. Two methods of state marking
are used for the oracles: a phase-flip method employed by other experimental
demonstrations, and a Boolean method requiring an ancilla qubit that is
directly equivalent to the state-marking scheme required to perform a classical
search. All quantum solutions are shown to outperform their classical
counterparts. We also report the first implementation of a Toffoli-4 gate,
which is used along with Toffoli-3 gates to construct the algorithms; these
gates have process fidelities of 70.5% and 89.6%, respectively."
"Artificial Neural Network computation relies on intensive vector-matrix
multiplications. Recently, the emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) crossbar array
showed a feasibility of implementing such operations with high energy
efficiency, thus there are many works on efficiently utilizing emerging NVM
crossbar array as analog vector-matrix multiplier. However, its nonlinear I-V
characteristics restrain critical design parameters, such as the read voltage
and weight range, resulting in substantial accuracy loss. In this paper,
instead of optimizing hardware parameters to a given neural network, we propose
a methodology of reconstructing a neural network itself optimized to resistive
memory crossbar arrays. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we
simulated various neural network with MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset using two
different specific Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model. Simulation
results show that our proposed neural network produces significantly higher
inference accuracies than conventional neural network when the synapse devices
have nonlinear I-V characteristics."
"This paper serves as a review and discussion of the recent works on
memcomputing. In particular, the $\textit{universal memcomputing machine}$
(UMM) and the $\textit{digital memcomputing machine}$ (DMM) are discussed. We
review the memcomputing concept in the dynamical systems framework and assess
the algorithms offered for computing $NP$ problems in the UMM and DMM
paradigms. We argue that the UMM is a physically implausible machine, and that
the DMM model, as described by numerical simulations, is no more powerful than
Turing-complete computation. We claim that the evidence for the resolution of
$P$ vs. $NP$ is therefore inconclusive, and conclude that the memcomputing
machine paradigm constitutes an energy efficient, special-purpose class of
models of dynamical systems computation."
"In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, an initial highly entangled
state called a graph state is used to perform universal quantum computations by
a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements and post-measurement Pauli-X
and Pauli-Z corrections. The needed computations are organized as measurement
patterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in
a pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and
output qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum
computation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally
nondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to
guarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)
is a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a
dependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve
determinism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to
simplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and
Pauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement
calculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these
rules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.
Moreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing
many ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a
new scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow
or gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for
geometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed
approach is improved over the previous ones."
"Reversible logic has two main properties. First, the number of inputs is
equal to the number of outputs. Second, it implements a one-to-one mapping;
i.e., one can reconstruct the inputs from the outputs. These properties enable
its applications in building quantum computing architectures.
  In this paper we study reverse engineering of reversible logic circuits,
including reverse engineering of non-reversible functions embedded into
reversible circuits. We propose the number of embeddings of non-reversible
functions into a reversible circuit as the security metric for reverse
engineering. We analyze the security benefits of automatic synthesis of
reversible circuits. We use our proposed security metric to show that the
functional synthesis approaches yield reversible circuits that are more
resilient to reverse engineering than the structural synthesis approaches.
Finally, we propose scrambling of the inputs and outputs of a reversible
circuit to thwart reverse engineering."
"A totally new energy harvesting architecture that exploits ambient
electric-field (E-field) emitting from fluorescent light fixtures is presented.
A copper plate, 50 x 50 cm in size, is placed in between the ambient field to
extract energy by capacitive coupling. A low voltage prototype is designed,
structured and tested on a conventional ceiling-type 4-light fluorescent
troffer operating in 50 Hz 220 V AC power grid. It is examined that the
harvester is able to collect roughly 1.25 J of energy in 25 min when a 0.1 F of
super-capacitor is employed. The equivalent circuit and the physical model of
the proposed harvesting paradigm are provided, and the attainable power is
evaluated in both theoretical and experimental manner. The scavenged energy is
planned to be utilized for building battery-less Internet of Things (IoT)
networks that are obliged to sense environmental parameters, analyze the
gathered data, and remotely inform a higher authority within predefined
periods."
"The purpose of the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer is to find a set of
qubit values that minimize its objective function. For various reasons, the set
of qubit values returned by the D-Wave has errors. This paper presents a method
of improving the results returned by the D-Wave. The method individually
modifies the qubit values returned by the D-Wave to find a set of values which
is a minimum of the objective function. That set however is not necessarily
guaranteed to be a global minimum. The method is simple and easily incorporated
into any algorithm that has direct access to the sets of values returned by the
D-Wave. Examples are also presented that demonstrate the merit of using such a
sample improvement method."
"Rapid miniaturization and cost reduction of computing, along with the
availability of wearable and implantable physiological sensors have led to the
growth of human Body Area Network (BAN) formed by a network of such sensors and
computing devices. One promising application of such a network is wearable
health monitoring where the collected data from the sensors would be
transmitted and analyzed to assess the health of a person. Typically, the
devices in a BAN are connected through wireless (WBAN), which suffers from
energy inefficiency due to the high-energy consumption of wireless
transmission. Human Body Communication (HBC) uses the relatively low loss human
body as the communication medium to connect these devices, promising order(s)
of magnitude better energy-efficiency and built-in security compared to WBAN.
In this paper, we demonstrate a health monitoring device and system built using
Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) sensors and components, that can collect data
from physiological sensors and transmit it through a) intra-body HBC to another
device (hub) worn on the body or b) upload health data through HBC-based
human-machine interaction to an HBC capable machine. The system design
constraints and signal transfer characteristics for the implemented HBC-based
wearable health monitoring system are measured and analyzed, showing reliable
connectivity with >8x power savings compared to Bluetooth lowenergy (BTLE)."
"Conventional von-Neumann computing models have achieved remarkable feats for
the past few decades. However, they fail to deliver the required efficiency for
certain basic tasks like image and speech recognition when compared to
biological systems. As such, taking cues from biological systems, novel
computing paradigms are being explored for efficient hardware implementations
of recognition/classification tasks. The basic building blocks of such
neuromorphic systems are neurons and synapses. Towards that end, we propose a
leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neuron using domain wall motion induced by
magnetoelectric effect. Due to a strong elastic pinning between the
ferromagnetic domain wall (FM-DW) and the underlying ferro-electric domain wall
(FE-DW), the FM-DW gets dragged by the FE-DW on application of a voltage pulse.
The fact that FE materials are insulators allows for pure voltage-driven FM-DW
motion, which in turn can be used to mimic both the leaky and the integrate
behavior of a spiking neuron. Further, the voltage driven nature of the
proposed neuron allows energy-efficient operation. A detailed device to circuit
level simulation framework based on micromagnetic simulations has been
developed to analyze the feasibility of the proposed device."
"We present a synthesis framework to map logic networks into quantum circuits
for quantum computing. The synthesis framework is based on LUT networks
(lookup-table networks), which play a key role in conventional logic synthesis.
Establishing a connection between LUTs in a LUT network and reversible
single-target gates in a reversible network allows us to bridge conventional
logic synthesis with logic synthesis for quantum computing, despite several
fundamental differences. We call our synthesis framework LUT-based Hierarchical
Reversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS). Input to LHRS is a classical logic network;
output is a quantum network (realized in terms of Clifford+$T$ gates). The
framework offers to trade-off the number of qubits for the number of quantum
gates. In a first step, an initial network is derived that only consists of
single-target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in
the final quantum network. Different methods are then used to map each
single-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using
available resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
automatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double
precision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation
applications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components.
But due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it
can be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our
synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm
designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum
algorithms. Thus, the benchmarks and, more generally, the LHRS framework are an
essential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will
be practical in the first generations of quantum computers."
"Three-dimensional (3D)-stacking technology, which enables the integration of
DRAM and logic dies, offers high bandwidth and low energy consumption. It also
empowers new memory designs for executing tasks not traditionally associated
with memories. A practical 3D-stacked memory is Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), which
provides significant access bandwidth and low power consumption in a small
area. Although several studies have taken advantage of the novel architecture
of HMC, they have not fully explored either its characteristics in terms of
latency and bandwidth or their correlation with temperature and power
consumption. This paper is the first to characterize the thermal behavior of
HMC in a real environment using the AC-510 accelerator and to identify
temperature as a new limitation for this state-of-the-art design space.
Moreover, we deconstruct factors that contribute to access latency and reveal
their sources for high- and low-load accesses. The results and observations of
this work should provide constructive information for
high-performance-computing (HPC) research."
"Integer arithmetic is the underpinning of many quantum algorithms, with
applications ranging from Shor's algorithm over HHL for matrix inversion to
Hamiltonian simulation algorithms. A basic objective is to keep the required
resources to implement arithmetic as low as possible. This applies in
particular to the number of qubits required in the implementation as for the
foreseeable future this number is expected to be small. We present a reversible
circuit for integer multiplication that is inspired by Karatsuba's recursive
method. The main improvement over circuits that have been previously reported
in the literature is an asymptotic reduction of the amount of space required
from $O(n^{1.585})$ to $O(n^{1.427})$. This improvement is obtained in exchange
for a small constant increase in the number of operations by a factor less than
$2$ and a small asymptotic increase in depth for the parallel version. The
asymptotic improvement are obtained from analyzing pebble games on complete
ternary trees."
"Quantum circuits of many qubits are extremely difficult to realize; thus, the
number of qubits is an important metric in a quantum circuit design. Further,
scalable and reliable quantum circuits are based on Clifford + T gates. An
efficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the
number of T gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits.
Recently, the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by Babu [1] which
improves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates, number of
qubits, and delay. However, the recent design is not based on fault-tolerant
Clifford + T gates. Also, it has large number of qubits and garbage outputs.
Therefore, this work presents a T-count optimized quantum circuit for integer
multiplication with only $4 \cdot n + 1$ qubits and no garbage outputs. The
proposed quantum multiplier design saves the T-count by using a novel quantum
conditional adder circuit. Also, where one operand to the controlled adder is
zero, the conditional adder is replaced with a Toffoli gate array to further
save the T gates. To have fair comparison with the recent design by Babu and
get an actual estimate of the T-count, it is made garbageless by using
Bennett's garbage removal scheme. The proposed design achieves an average
T-count savings of $47.55\%$ compared to the recent work by Babu. Further,
comparison is also performed with other recent works by Lin et. al. [2], and
Jayashree et. al.[3]. Average T-count savings of $62.71\%$ and $26.30\%$ are
achieved compared to the recent works by Lin et. al., and Jayashree et. al.,
respectively."
"This work presents an algorithm to generate depth, quantum gate and qubit
optimized circuits for $GF(2^m)$ squaring in the polynomial basis. Further, to
the best of our knowledge the proposed quantum squaring circuit algorithm is
the only work that considers depth as a metric to be optimized. We compared
circuits generated by our proposed algorithm against the state of the art and
determine that they require $50 \%$ fewer qubits and offer gates savings that
range from $37 \%$ to $68 \%$. Further, existing quantum exponentiation are
based on either modular or integer arithmetic. However, Galois arithmetic is a
useful tool to design resource efficient quantum exponentiation circuit
applicable in quantum cryptanalysis. Therefore, we present the quantum circuit
implementation of Galois field exponentiation based on the proposed quantum
Galois field squaring circuit. We calculated a qubit savings ranging between
$44\%$ to $50\%$ and quantum gate savings ranging between $37 \%$ to $68 \%$
compared to identical quantum exponentiation circuit based on existing squaring
circuits."
"In recent years, numerous research efforts have been dedicated towards
developing efficient implantable devices for brain stimulation. However, there
are limitations and challenges with the current technologies. Firstly, the
stimulation of neurons currently is possible through implantable electrodes but
limited to a population of neurons. Secondly, a major hurdle lies in developing
miniature devices that can last for a lifetime in the patient's brain. In
parallel, Optogenetics has emerged proposing the stimulation of neurons using
light by means of optical fibers inserted through the skull. Many challenges
are thus introduced in terms of suitability to patient's lifestyle and
biocompatibility. We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic
nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment
problems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. The
WiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a
genetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic
vibrations. This paper investigates how light propagates in the brain tissue,
and based on the power required to emit sufficient intensity for stimulation,
an energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are
also proposed to maximize energy efficiency while ensuring minimum number of
neural spike misfirings. These protocols include the Charge and Fire, the
Predictive Sliding Detection Window, and its variant Markov-Chain based
Time-Delay Patterns. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for
25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain
based Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire. The results show the
feasibility of utilizing WiOptND for long-term implants, and a new direction
towards precise stimulation of neurons in the cortical columns of the brain."
"Recently we have shown that an architecture based on resistive processing
unit (RPU) devices has potential to achieve significant acceleration in deep
neural network (DNN) training compared to today's software-based DNN
implementations running on CPU/GPU. However, currently available device
candidates based on non-volatile memory technologies do not satisfy all the
requirements to realize the RPU concept. Here, we propose an analog CMOS-based
RPU design (CMOS RPU) which can store and process data locally and can be
operated in a massively parallel manner. We analyze various properties of the
CMOS RPU to evaluate the functionality and feasibility for acceleration of DNN
training."
"We give precise quantum resource estimates for Shor's algorithm to compute
discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields. The estimates are
derived from a simulation of a Toffoli gate network for controlled elliptic
curve point addition, implemented within the framework of the quantum computing
software toolsuite LIQ$Ui|\rangle$. We determine circuit implementations for
reversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and
inversion, as well as reversible elliptic curve point addition. We conclude
that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an
$n$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most $9n +
2\lceil\log_2(n)\rceil+10$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most $448 n^3
\log_2(n) + 4090 n^3$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the
Toffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition
as the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the NIST standard curves P-192,
P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to
recent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also
confirm estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for
current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of
qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA,
suggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA."
"Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology which, compared to
classical computation, allows for substantial speed-ups e.g. for integer
factorization or database search. However, since physical realizations of
quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in
this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on classical
machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state of the art
simulators tackle by applying massive hardware power. In this work, we revisit
the basics of quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states
and quantum operations can be represented, and, eventually, simulated in a more
efficient fashion. This leads to a simulation approach which works
complementary different to the state-of-the-art. Experimental evaluations show
that the proposed solution is capable of simulating quantum computations with
more qubits than before, and in significantly less run-time (several magnitudes
faster compared to previously proposed simulators). An implementation of the
proposed simulator is publicly available online."
"Motivated by advantages of current-mode design, this brief contribution
explores the implementation of weight matrices in neuromemristive systems via
current-mode memristor crossbar circuits. After deriving theoretical results
for the range and distribution of weights in the current-mode design, it is
shown that any weight matrix based on voltage-mode crossbars can be mapped to a
current-mode crossbar if the voltage-mode weights are carefully bounded. Then,
a modified gradient descent rule is derived for the current-mode design that
can be used to perform backpropagation training. Behavioral simulations on the
MNIST dataset indicate that both voltage and current-mode designs are able to
achieve similar accuracy and have similar defect tolerance. However, analysis
of trained weight distributions reveals that current-mode and voltage-mode
designs may use different feature representations."
"Memories that exploit three-dimensional (3D)-stacking technology, which
integrate memory and logic dies in a single stack, are becoming popular. These
memories, such as Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), utilize a network-on-chip (NoC)
design for connecting their internal structural organizations. This novel usage
of NoC, in addition to aiding processing-in-memory capabilities, enables
numerous benefits such as high bandwidth and memory-level parallelism. However,
the implications of NoCs on the characteristics of 3D-stacked memories in terms
of memory access latency and bandwidth have not been fully explored. This paper
addresses this knowledge gap by (i) characterizing an HMC prototype on the
AC-510 accelerator board and revealing its access latency behaviors, and (ii)
by investigating the implications of such behaviors on system and software
designs."
"Progress in quantum computing hardware raises questions about how these
devices can be controlled, programmed, and integrated with existing
computational workflows. We briefly describe several prominent quantum
computational models, their associated quantum processing units (QPUs), and the
adoption of these devices as accelerators within high-performance computing
systems. Emphasizing the interface to the QPU, we analyze instruction set
architectures based on reduced and complex instruction sets, i.e., RISC and
CISC architectures. We clarify the role of conventional constraints on memory
addressing and instruction widths within the quantum computing context.
Finally, we examine existing quantum computing platforms, including the D-Wave
2000Q and IBM Quantum Experience, within the context of future ISA development
and HPC needs."
"In this paper we study the ways to use a global entangling operator to
efficiently implement circuitry common to a selection of important quantum
algorithms. In particular, we focus on the circuits composed with global Ising
entangling gates and arbitrary addressable single-qubit gates. We show that
under certain circumstances the use of global operations can substantially
improve the entangling gate count."
"In this paper, we propose a way for designing a power efficient and high
speed deep neural networks (DNNs) based on hardware electronic synapse devices.
A learning rule based on a back-propagation (BP) algorithm is proposed to
implement a hardware-based neural network (HW-DNN) using electronic devices
that exhibit discrete and limited conductance characteristics. Then, using a
3-layer perceptron network, we evaluate the learning performance according to
the various conductance responses of the electronic synapse devices and the
weight update methods. It is shown that the learning accuracy can be comparable
to that obtained by using software-based BP algorithm when the electronic
synapse device has the linear and symmetric conductance response. Furthermore,
the proposed unidirectional weight update method is suitable for electronic
synapse devices which have nonlinear and asymmetric conductance response.
Because the unidirectional weight update method can cancel the effect of
asymmetric conductance response, the better accuracy can be obtained."
"This technical report deals with the concept of an artificial DNA which
contains a blueprint of the structure and organization of an embedded system.
This blueprint can be used to build up the embedded system in a self-organizing
manner at run-time. The report describes in detail the basic principles of the
the artificial DNA and its relationship to standard design methods for embedded
systems. A prototypic implementation is presented and evaluated. Additionally,
future work is described and a conclusion is given."
"Wireless video streaming has traditionally been considered an extremely
power-hungry operation. Existing approaches optimize the camera and
communication modules individually to minimize their power consumption.
However, the joint redesign and optimization of wireless communication as well
as the camera is what that provides more power saving. We present an
ultra-low-power wireless video streaming camera. To achieve this, we present a
novel ""analog"" video backscatter technique that feeds analog pixels from the
photo-diodes directly to the backscatter hardware, thereby eliminating power
consuming hardware components such as ADCs and amplifiers. We prototype our
wireless camera using off-the-shelf hardware and show that our design can
stream video at up to 13 FPS and can operate up to a distance of 150 feet from
the access point. Our COTS prototype consumes 2.36mW. Finally, to demonstrate
the potential of our design, we built two proof-of-concept applications: video
streaming for micro-robots and security cameras for face detection."
"We present some basic integer arithmetic quantum circuits, such as adders and
multipliers-accumulators of various forms, as well as diagonal operators, which
operate on multilevel qudits. The integers to be processed are represented in
an alternative basis after they have been Fourier transformed. Several
arithmetic circuits operating on Fourier transformed integers have appeared in
the literature for two level qubits. Here we extend these techniques on
multilevel qudits, as they may offer some advantages relative to qubits
implementations. The arithmetic circuits presented can be used as basic
building blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation,
quantum simulation, quantum optimization etc., but they can also be used in the
implementation of a quantum fractional Fourier transform as it is shown in a
companion work presented separately."
"On distributed memory electronic computers, the implementation and
association of fast parallel matrix multiplication algorithms has yielded
astounding results and insights. In this discourse, we use the tools of
molecular biology to demonstrate the theoretical encoding of Strassen's fast
matrix multiplication algorithm with DNA based on an $n$-moduli set in the
residue number system, thereby demonstrating the viability of computational
mathematics with DNA. As a result, a general scalable implementation of this
model in the DNA computing paradigm is presented and can be generalized to the
application of \emph{all} fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a DNA
computer. We also discuss the practical capabilities and issues of this
scalable implementation. Fast methods of matrix computations with DNA are
important because they also allow for the efficient implementation of other
algorithms (i.e. inversion, computing determinants, and graph theory) with DNA."
"Energy minimization of Ising spin-glasses has played a central role in
statistical and solid-state physics, facilitating studies of phase transitions
and magnetism. Recent proposals suggest using Ising spin-glasses for
non-traditional computing as a way to harness the nature's ability to find
min-energy configurations, and to take advantage of quantum tunneling to boost
combinatorial optimization. Laboratory demonstrations have been unconvincing so
far and lack a non-quantum baseline for definitive comparisons. In this work we
(i) design and evaluate new computational techniques to simulate natural energy
minimization in spin glasses and (ii) explore their application to study design
alternatives in quantum adiabatic computers. Unlike previous work, our
algorithms are not limited to planar Ising topologies. In one CPU-day, our
branch-and-bound algorithm finds ground states on 100 spins, while our local
search approximates ground states on 1, 000, 000 spins. We use this
computational tool as a simulator to study the significance of hyper-couplings
in the context of recently implemented adiabatic quantum computers."
"This paper proposed a new method to build the large scale DNA sequences
search system based on web search engine technology. We give a very brief
introduction for the methods used in search engine first. Then how to build a
DNA search system like Google is illustrated in detail. Since there is no local
alignment process, this system is able to provide the ms level search services
for billions of DNA sequences in a typical server."
"With the explosion of wireless networks and automotive radar systems, there
is an acute need for new materials and technologies that would not only
minimize the size of these devices, but also enhance their performances. The
technique of transformation optics-an innovative approach to produce artificial
metamaterials that control electromagnetic waves as if space itself was
transformed-provides unique opportunities to reach this goal. In this paper we
design, fabricate and characterize a new class of metamaterial capable of
transforming the source distribution and radiation pattern of an isotropic
microwave emitter. Our findings have considerable implications for the
development of new ultradirective antennas with superior performances and
compactness compared to conventional antennas operating in the same frequency
range."
"In this work we propose a generalization of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly
Model (aTAM) in which tile types are assigned rigid shapes, or geometries,
along each tile face. We examine the number of distinct tile types needed to
assemble shapes within this model, the temperature required for efficient
assembly, and the problem of designing compact geometric faces to meet given
compatibility specifications. Our results show a dramatic decrease in the
number of tile types needed to assemble $n \times n$ squares to
$\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ at temperature 1 for the most simple model which meets
a lower bound from Kolmogorov complexity, and $O(\log\log n)$ in a model in
which tile aggregates must move together through obstacle free paths within the
plane. This stands in contrast to the $\Theta(\log n / \log\log n)$ tile types
at temperature 2 needed in the basic aTAM. We also provide a general method for
simulating a large and computationally universal class of temperature 2 aTAM
systems with geometric tiles at temperature 1. Finally, we consider the problem
of computing a set of compact geometric faces for a tile system to implement a
given set of compatibility specifications. We show a number of bounds on the
complexity of geometry size needed for various classes of compatibility
specifications, many of which we directly apply to our tile assembly results to
achieve non-trivial reductions in geometry size."

"This Master thesis examines issues of interoperability and integration
between the Classic Information Science (CIS) and Quantum Information Science
(QIS). It provides a short introduction to the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
and proceeds to describe the development steps that have lead to a prototype
XML specification for quantum computing (QIS-XML). QIS-XML is a proposed
framework, based on the widely used standard (XML) to describe, visualize,
exchange and process quantum gates and quantum circuits. It also provides a
potential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers
through the concept of XML driven compilers. Examples are provided for the
description of commonly used quantum gates and circuits, accompanied with tools
to visualize them in standard web browsers. An algorithmic example is also
presented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and
running the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial
effort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the
architecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a
widely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and
quantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and
facilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts. This would
support the consolidation of Classic Information Science and Quantum
Information Science into a Complete Information Science, a challenge that could
be referred to as the ""Information Science Grand Unification Challenge""."
"This paper discusses some topics related to the latest trends in the field of
evolutionary approaches to iris recognition. It presents the results of an
exploratory experimental simulation whose goal was to analyze the possibility
of establishing an Interchange Protocol for Digital Identities evolved in
different geographic locations interconnected through and into an Intelligent
Iris Verifier Distributed System (IIVDS) based on multi-enrollment. Finding a
logically consistent model for the Interchange Protocol is the key factor in
designing the future large-scale iris biometric networks. Therefore, the
logical model of such a protocol is also investigated here. All tests are made
on Bath Iris Database and prove that outstanding power of discrimination
between the intra- and the inter-class comparisons can be achieved by an IIVDS,
even when practicing 52.759.182 inter-class and 10.991.943 intra-class
comparisons. Still, the test results confirm that inconsistent enrollment can
change the logic of recognition from a fuzzified 2-valent consistent logic of
biometric certitudes to a fuzzified 3-valent inconsistent possibilistic logic
of biometric beliefs justified through experimentally determined probabilities,
or to a fuzzified 8-valent logic which is almost consistent as a biometric
theory - this quality being counterbalanced by an absolutely reasonable loss in
the user comfort level."
"We design logic circuits based on the notion of zero forcing on graphs; each
gate of the circuits is a gadget in which zero forcing is performed. We show
that such circuits can evaluate every monotone Boolean function. By using two
vertices to encode each logical bit, we obtain universal computation. We also
highlight a phenomenon of ""back forcing"" as a property of each function. Such a
phenomenon occurs in a circuit when the input of gates which have been already
used at a given time step is further modified by a computation actually
performed at a later stage. Finally, we point out that zero forcing can be also
used to implement reversible computation. The model introduced here provides a
potentially new tool in the analysis of Boolean functions, with particular
attention to monotonicity."
"Sampling theory encompasses all aspects related to the conversion of
continuous-time signals to discrete streams of numbers. The famous
Shannon-Nyquist theorem has become a landmark in the development of digital
signal processing. In modern applications, an increasingly number of functions
is being pushed forward to sophisticated software algorithms, leaving only
those delicate finely-tuned tasks for the circuit level.
  In this paper, we review sampling strategies which target reduction of the
ADC rate below Nyquist. Our survey covers classic works from the early 50's of
the previous century through recent publications from the past several years.
The prime focus is bridging theory and practice, that is to pinpoint the
potential of sub-Nyquist strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. In
that spirit, we integrate contemporary theoretical viewpoints, which study
signal modeling in a union of subspaces, together with a taste of practical
aspects, namely how the avant-garde modalities boil down to concrete signal
processing systems. Our hope is that this presentation style will attract the
interest of both researchers and engineers in the hope of promoting the
sub-Nyquist premise into practical applications, and encouraging further
research into this exciting new frontier."
"The Calculus of Wrapped Compartments (CWC) is a recently proposed modelling
language for the representation and simulation of biological systems behaviour.
Although CWC has no explicit structure modelling a spatial geometry, its
compartment labelling feature can be exploited to model various examples of
spatial interactions in a natural way. However, specifying large networks of
compartments may require a long modelling phase. In this work we present a
surface language for CWC that provides basic constructs for modelling spatial
interactions. These constructs can be compiled away to obtain a standard CWC
model, thus exploiting the existing CWC simulation tool. A case study
concerning the modelling of Arbuscular Mychorrizal fungi growth is discussed."
"We solve the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP), for P systems based
on digraphs with simplex channels, where communication is restricted by the
direction of structural arcs. Previous work on FSSP for P systems focused
exclusively on P systems with duplex channels, where communication between
parents and children is bidirectional. Our P solution, the first for simplex
channels, requires cell IDs, strongly connected digraphs and some awareness of
the local topology (such as each cell's outdegree)---we argue that these
requirements are necessary. Compared to the known solutions for cellular
automata, our solution is substantially simpler and faster."
"In this article we consider a new derivation mode for generalized
communicating P systems (GCPS) corresponding to the functioning of population
protocols (PP) and based on the sequential derivation mode and a fairness
condition. We show that PP can be seen as a particular variant of GCPS. We also
consider a particular stochastic evolution satisfying the fairness condition
and obtain that it corresponds to the run of a Gillespie's SSA. This permits to
further describe the dynamics of GCPS by a system of ODEs when the population
size goes to the infinity."
"Nowadays, multiscale modelling is recognized as the most suitable way to
study biological processes. Indeed, almost every phenomenon in nature exhibits
a multiscale behaviour, i.e., it is the outcome of interactions that occur at
different spatial and temporal scales. Although several ways to provide
""multilayer"" models have been proposed, only Complex Automata naturally embed
spatial information and realize the multiscale approach with well-established
inter-scale integration schemas. Recently, such approach has been restated in
terms of Spatial P systems - a variant of P systems with a more geometric
concept of space.
  In this work we discuss how mobile membranes, a variant of membrane systems
inspired by the biological movements of endocytosis and exocytosis, can be
efficaciously exploited to define a uniform multiscale coupling scheme relying
only on the features of the formalism itself."
"Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large cell, visible by unaided eye,
which exhibits sophisticated patterns of foraging behaviour. The plasmodium's
behaviour is well interpreted in terms of computation, where data are spatially
extended configurations of nutrients and obstacles, and results of computation
are networks of protoplasmic tubes formed by the plasmodium. In laboratory
experiments and numerical simulation we show that if plasmodium of Physarum is
inoculated in a maze's peripheral channel and an oat flake (source of
attractants) in a the maze's central chamber then the plasmodium grows toward
target oat flake and connects the flake with the site of original inoculation
with a pronounced protoplasmic tube. The protoplasmic tube represents a path in
the maze. The plasmodium solves maze in one pass because it is assisted by a
gradient of chemo-attractants propagating from the target oat flake."
"The paper shows that ranking information units by quantum probability differs
from ranking them by classical probability provided the same data used for
parameter estimation. As probability of detection (also known as recall or
power) and probability of false alarm (also known as fallout or size) measure
the quality of ranking, we point out and show that ranking by quantum
probability yields higher probability of detection than ranking by classical
probability provided a given probability of false alarm and the same parameter
estimation data. As quantum probability provided more effective detectors than
classical probability within other domains that data management, we conjecture
that, the system that can implement subspace-based detectors shall be more
effective than a system which implements a set-based detectors, the
effectiveness being calculated as expected recall estimated over the
probability of detection and expected fallout estimated over the probability of
false alarm."
"This position paper overviews several challenges of collective adaptive
systems, which are beyond the research objectives of current top-projects in
ICT, and especially in FET, initiatives. The attention is paid not only to
challenges and new research topics, but also to their impact and potential
breakthroughs in information and communication technologies."
"The DNA microarray technology has modernized the approach of biology research
in such a way that scientists can now measure the expression levels of
thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment. Gene expression
profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level, have great
potential as a medical diagnosis tool. But compared to the number of genes
involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample
size for classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge
to certain classification methodologies. Feature selection techniques can be
used to extract the marker genes which influence the classification accuracy
effectively by eliminating the un wanted noisy and redundant genes This paper
presents a review of feature selection techniques that have been employed in
micro array data based cancer classification and also the predominant role of
SVM for cancer classification."
"The number of Sensor Observation Service (SOS) instances available online has
been increasing in the last few years. The SOS specification standardises
interfaces and data formats for exchanging sensor-related in-formation between
information providers and consumers. SOS in conjunction with other
specifications in the Sensor Web Enablement initiative, at-tempts to realise
the Sensor Web vision, a worldwide system where sensor networks of any kind are
interconnected. In this paper we present an empirical study of actual instances
of servers implementing SOS. The study focuses mostly in which parts of the
specification are more frequently included in real implementations, and how
exchanged messages follows the structure defined by XML Schema files. Our
findings can be of practical use when implementing servers and clients based on
the SOS specification, as they can be optimized for common scenarios."
"Biomolecular computers, along with quantum computers, may be a future
alternative for traditional, silicon-based computers. Main advantages of
biomolecular computers are massive parallel processing of data, expanded
capacity of storing information and compatibility with living organisms (first
attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of
improper genetic information are described in Benenson et al.(2004). However,
biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming
procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and
interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory
implementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing
machine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA
computers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory
implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing
DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton
established by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new
attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing
two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works.
This creates an opportunity to implement in laboratories of more complex finite
automata and other theoretical models of computers: pushdown automata, Turing
machines."
"In our work we propose implementing fuzzy logic using memristors. Min and max
operations are done by antipodally configured memristor circuits that may be
assembled into computational circuits. We discuss computational power of such
circuits with respect to m-efficiency and experimentally observed behavior of
memristive devices. Circuits implemented with real devices are likely to
manifest learning behavior. The circuits presented in the work may be
applicable for instance in fuzzy classifiers."
"Algorithmic Cooling (AC) of spins applies entropy manipulation algorithms in
open spin-systems in order to cool spins far beyond Shannon's entropy bound. AC
of nuclear spins was demonstrated experimentally, and may contribute to nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Several cooling algorithms were
suggested in recent years, including practicable algorithmic cooling (PAC) and
exhaustive AC. Practicable algorithms have simple implementations, yet their
level of cooling is far from optimal; Exhaustive algorithms, on the other hand,
cool much better, and some even reach (asymptotically) an optimal level of
cooling, but they are not practicable. We introduce here semi-optimal
practicable AC (SOPAC), wherein few cycles (typically 2-6) are performed at
each recursive level. Two classes of SOPAC algorithms are proposed and
analyzed. Both attain cooling levels significantly better than PAC, and are
much more efficient than the exhaustive algorithms. The new algorithms are
shown to bridge the gap between PAC and exhaustive AC. In addition, we
calculated the number of spins required by SOPAC in order to purify qubits for
quantum computation. As few as 12 and 7 spins are required (in an ideal
scenario) to yield a mildly pure spin (60% polarized) from initial
polarizations of 1% and 10%, respectively. In the latter case, about five more
spins are sufficient to produce a highly pure spin (99.99% polarized), which
could be relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing."
"This paper introduces a fuzzy cellular model of road traffic that was
intended for on-line applications in traffic control. The presented model uses
fuzzy sets theory to deal with uncertainty of both input data and simulation
results. Vehicles are modelled individually, thus various classes of them can
be taken into consideration. In the proposed approach, all parameters of
vehicles are described by means of fuzzy numbers. The model was implemented in
a simulation of vehicles queue discharge process. Changes of the queue length
were analysed in this experiment and compared to the results of NaSch cellular
automata model."
"The class of memory circuit elements which comprises memristive,
memcapacitive, and meminductive systems, is gaining considerable attention in a
broad range of disciplines. This is due to the enormous flexibility these
elements provide in solving diverse problems in analog/neuromorphic and
digital/quantum computation; the possibility to use them in an integrated
computing-memory paradigm, massively-parallel solution of different
optimization problems, learning, neural networks, etc. The time is therefore
ripe to introduce these elements to the next generation of physicists and
engineers with appropriate teaching tools that can be easily implemented in
undergraduate teaching laboratories. In this paper, we suggest the use of
easy-to-build emulators to provide a hands-on experience for the students to
learn the fundamental properties and realize several applications of these
memelements. We provide explicit examples of problems that could be tackled
with these emulators that range in difficulty from the demonstration of the
basic properties of memristive, memcapacitive, and meminductive systems to
logic/computation and cross-bar memory. The emulators can be built from
off-the-shelf components, with a total cost of a few tens of dollars, thus
providing a relatively inexpensive platform for the implementation of these
exercises in the classroom. We anticipate that this experiment-based learning
can be easily adopted and expanded by the instructors with many more case
studies."
"A resistive memory network that has no crossover wiring is proposed to
overcome the hardware limitations to size and functional complexity that is
associated with conventional analogue neural networks. The proposed memory
network is based on simple network cells that are arranged in a hierarchical
modular architecture. Cognitive functionality of this network is demonstrated
by an example of character recognition. The network is trained by an
evolutionary process to completely recognise characters deformed by random
noise, rotation, scaling and shifting"
"Human brain is functionally and physically complex. This 'complexity' can be
seen as a result of biological design process involving extensive use of
concepts such as modularity and hierarchy. Over the past decade, deeper
insights into the functioning of cortical neurons have led to the development
of models that can be implemented in hardware. The implementation of
biologically inspired spiking neuron networks in silicon can provide solutions
to difficult cognitive tasks. The work reported in this paper is an application
of a VLSI cortical neuron model for low power design. The VLSI implementation
shown in this paper is based on the spike and burst firing pattern of cortex
and follows the Izhikevich neuron model. This model is applied to a DC
differential amplifier as practical application of power reduction"
"Traditional computers work with finite numbers. Situations where the usage of
infinite or infinitesimal quantities is required are studied mainly
theoretically. In this paper, a recently introduced computational methodology
(that is not related to the non-standard analysis) is used to work with finite,
infinite, and infinitesimal numbers \textit{numerically}. This can be done on a
new kind of a computer - the Infinity Computer - able to work with all these
types of numbers. The new computational tools both give possibilities to
execute computations of a new type and open new horizons for creating new
mathematical models where a computational usage of infinite and/or
infinitesimal numbers can be useful. A number of numerical examples showing the
potential of the new approach and dealing with divergent series, limits,
probability theory, linear algebra, and calculation of volumes of objects
consisting of parts of different dimensions are given."
"There exist many applications where it is necessary to approximate
numerically derivatives of a function which is given by a computer procedure.
In particular, all the fields of optimization have a special interest in such a
kind of information. In this paper, a new way to do this is presented for a new
kind of a computer -- the Infinity Computer -- able to work numerically with
finite, infinite, and infinitesimal numbers. It is proved that the Infinity
Computer is able to calculate values of derivatives of a higher order for a
wide class of functions represented by computer procedures. It is shown that
the ability to compute derivatives of arbitrary order automatically and
accurate to working precision is an intrinsic property of the Infinity Computer
related to its way of functioning. Numerical examples illustrating the new
concepts and numerical tools are given."
"Secured opportunistic Medium Access Control (MAC) and complexity reduction in
channel estimation are proposed in the Cross layer design Cognitive Radio
Networks deploying the secured dynamic channel allocation from the endorsed
channel reservation. Channel Endorsement and Transmission policy is deployed to
optimize the free channel selection as well as channel utilization to cognitive
radio users. This strategy provide the secured and reliable link to secondary
users as well as the collision free link to primary users between the physical
and MAC layers which yields the better network performance. On the other hand,
Complexity Reduction in Minimum Mean Square Errror (CR-MMSE) and Maximum
Likelihood (CR-ML) algorithm on Decision Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) is
deployed significantly to achieve computational complexity as Least Square (LS)
method. Rigorously, CR-MMSE in sample spaced channel impulse response (SS-CIR)
is implemented by allowing the computationally inspired matrix inversion.
Regarding CR-ML, Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation (PSAM) with DDCE is
implemented such the pilot symbol sequence provides the significant performance
gain in frequency correlation using the finite delay spread. It is found that
CRMMSE demonstrates outstanding Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance over MMSE
and LS, and CR-ML over MMSE and ML."
"Quantum networks will support long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD)
and distributed quantum computation, and are an active area of both
experimental and theoretical research. Here, we present an analysis of
topologically complex networks of quantum repeaters composed of heterogeneous
links. Quantum networks have fundamental behavioral differences from classical
networks; the delicacy of quantum states makes a practical path selection
algorithm imperative, but classical notions of resource utilization are not
directly applicable, rendering known path selection mechanisms inadequate. To
adapt Dijkstra's algorithm for quantum repeater networks that generate
entangled Bell pairs, we quantify the key differences and define a link cost
metric, seconds per Bell pair of a particular fidelity, where a single Bell
pair is the resource consumed to perform one quantum teleportation. Simulations
that include both the physical interactions and the extensive classical
messaging confirm that Dijkstra's algorithm works well in a quantum context.
Simulating about three hundred heterogeneous paths, comparing our path cost and
the total work along the path gives a coefficient of determination of 0.88 or
better."
"Acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a monstrously large single
cell visible by an unaided eye. It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in
foraging for nutrients and developing an optimal transport network of
protoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients. The slime mould sufficiently
approximates man-made transport networks on a flat substrate. Does slime mould
imitate man-made transport networks on three-dimensional terrain as well as it
does on a flat substrate? We simplified the problem to approximation of a
single transport route. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA
and Germany we imitated development of route 20, the longest road in USA, and
autobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mould
builds longer transport routes on 3D terrains, comparing to flat agar plates
yet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We discuss how
nutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mould, how
the mould navigates around elevations, and offer an automaton model of slime
mould which might explain variability of the protoplasmic routes constructed.
We also display results of scoping experiments with slime mould on 3D terrains
of Russia and United Kingdom."
"Detailed exploration on Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and its recent trends
has been done in this paper. Work is being done to identify objects, images,
videos and their color compositions. Efforts are on the way in understanding
speech, words, emotions, feelings and moods. When humans watch the surrounding
environment, visual data is processed by the brain, and it is possible to
reconstruct the same on the screen with some appreciable accuracy by analyzing
the physiological data. This data is acquired by using one of the non-invasive
techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) in BCI. The acquired signal is to
be translated to produce the image on to the screen. This paper also lays
suitable directions for future work."
"This volume contains the papers presented at the 6th Membrane Computing and
Biologically Inspired Process Calculi (MeCBIC 2012), a satellite workshop of

"In present day technology, storing and processing of information occur on
physically distinct regions of space. Not only does this result in space
limitations; it also translates into unwanted delays in retrieving and
processing of relevant information. There is, however, a class of two-terminal
passive circuit elements with memory, memristive, memcapacitive and
meminductive systems -- collectively called memelements -- that perform both
information processing and storing of the initial, intermediate and final
computational data on the same physical platform. Importantly, the states of
these memelements adjust to input signals and provide analog capabilities
unavailable in standard circuit elements, resulting in adaptive circuitry, and
providing analog massively-parallel computation. All these features are
tantalizingly similar to those encountered in the biological realm, thus
offering new opportunities for biologically-inspired computation. Of particular
importance is the fact that these memelements emerge naturally in nanoscale
systems, and are therefore a consequence and a natural by-product of the
continued miniaturization of electronic devices. We will discuss the various
possibilities offered by memcomputing, discuss the criteria that need to be
satisfied to realize this paradigm, and provide an example showing the solution
of the shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the
solution path."
"Numerous energy harvesting wireless devices that will serve as building
blocks for the Internet of Things (IoT) are currently under development.
However, there is still only limited understanding of the properties of various
energy sources and their impact on energy harvesting adaptive algorithms.
Hence, we focus on characterizing the kinetic (motion) energy that can be
harvested by a wireless node with an IoT form factor and on developing energy
allocation algorithms for such nodes. In this paper, we describe methods for
estimating harvested energy from acceleration traces. To characterize the
energy availability associated with specific human activities (e.g., relaxing,
walking, cycling), we analyze a motion dataset with over 40 participants. Based
on acceleration measurements that we collected for over 200 hours, we study
energy generation processes associated with day-long human routines. We also
briefly summarize our experiments with moving objects. We develop energy
allocation algorithms that take into account practical IoT node design
considerations, and evaluate the algorithms using the collected measurements.
Our observations provide insights into the design of motion energy harvesters,
IoT nodes, and energy harvesting adaptive algorithms."
"The modelling, analysis, and visualisation of dynamic geospatial phenomena
has been identified as a key developmental challenge for next-generation
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this context, the envisaged
paradigmatic extensions to contemporary foundational GIS technology raises
fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational, and
(analytical) computational methods that would underlie their spatial
information theoretic underpinnings.
  We present the conceptual overview and architecture for the development of
high-level semantic and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic
geospatial domains. Building on formal methods in the areas of commonsense
reasoning, qualitative reasoning, spatial and temporal representation and
reasoning, reasoning about actions and change, and computational models of
narrative, we identify concrete theoretical and practical challenges that
accrue in the context of formal reasoning about `space, events, actions, and
change'. With this as a basis, and within the backdrop of an illustrated
scenario involving the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban narratives, we address
specific problems and solutions techniques chiefly involving `qualitative
abstraction', `data integration and spatial consistency', and `practical
geospatial abduction'. From a broad topical viewpoint, we propose that
next-generation dynamic GIS technology demands a transdisciplinary scientific
perspective that brings together Geography, Artificial Intelligence, and
Cognitive Science.

"Reconstruction of gene regulatory networks or 'reverse-engineering' is a
process of identifying gene interaction networks from experimental microarray
gene expression profile through computation techniques. In this paper, we tried
to reconstruct cancer-specific gene regulatory network using information
theoretic approach - mutual information. The considered microarray data
consists of large number of genes with 20 samples - 12 samples from colon
cancer patient and 8 from normal cell. The data has been preprocessed and
normalized. A t-test statistics has been applied to filter differentially
expressed genes. The interaction between filtered genes has been computed using
mutual information and ten different networks has been constructed with varying
number of interactions ranging from 30 to 500. We performed the topological
analysis of the reconstructed network, revealing a large number of interactions
in colon cancer. Finally, validation of the inferred results has been done with
available biological databases and literature."
"We show that memcapacitive (memory capacitive) systems can be used as
synapses in artificial neural networks. As an example of our approach, we
discuss the architecture of an integrate-and-fire neural network based on
memcapacitive synapses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity can be simply realized with some of these
devices. Memcapacitive synapses are a low-energy alternative to memristive
synapses for neuromorphic computation."
"This short survey of recent work in tile self-assembly discusses the use of
simulation to classify and separate the computational and expressive power of
self-assembly models. The journey begins with the result that there is a single
universal tile set that, with proper initialization and scaling, simulates any
tile assembly system. This universal tile set exhibits something stronger than
Turing universality: it captures the geometry and dynamics of any simulated
system. From there we find that there is no such tile set in the
noncooperative, or temperature 1, model, proving it weaker than the full tile
assembly model. In the two-handed or hierarchal model, where large assemblies
can bind together on one step, we encounter an infinite set, of infinite
hierarchies, each with strictly increasing simulation power. Towards the end of
our trip, we find one tile to rule them all: a single rotatable flipable
polygonal tile that can simulate any tile assembly system. It seems this could
be the beginning of a much longer journey, so directions for future work are
suggested."
"In this paper, we explore relationships between two models of systems which
are governed by only the local interactions of large collections of simple
components: cellular automata (CA) and the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM).
While sharing several similarities, the models have fundamental differences,
most notably the dynamic nature of CA (in which every cell location is allowed
to change state an infinite number of times) versus the static nature of the
aTAM (in which tiles are static components that can never change or be removed
once they attach to a growing assembly). We work with 2-dimensional systems in
both models, and for our results we first define what it means for CA systems
to simulate aTAM systems, and then for aTAM systems to simulate CA systems. We
use notions of simulate which are similar to those used in the study of
intrinsic universality since they are in some sense strict, but also
intuitively natural notions of simulation. We then demonstrate a particular
nondeterministic CA which can be configured so that it can simulate any
arbitrary aTAM system, and finally an aTAM tile set which can be configured so
that it can be used to simulate any arbitrary nondeterministic CA system which
begins with a finite initial configuration."
"This work describes preliminary steps towards nano-scale reservoir computing
using quantum dots. Our research has focused on the development of an
accumulator-based sensing system that reacts to changes in the environment, as
well as the development of a software simulation. The investigated systems
generate nonlinear responses to inputs that make them suitable for a physical
implementation of a neural network. This development will enable
miniaturisation of the neurons to the molecular level, leading to a range of
applications including monitoring of changes in materials or structures. The
system is based around the optical properties of quantum dots. The paper will
report on experimental work on systems using Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum
dots and on the various methods to render the systems sensitive to pH, redox
potential or specific ion concentration. Once the quantum dot-based systems are
rendered sensitive to these triggers they can provide a distributed array that
can monitor and transmit information on changes within the material."
"Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the field of brain-inspired
computing based on neural-network architectures. In order to translate the
related algorithmic models into powerful, yet energy-efficient
cognitive-computing hardware, computing-devices beyond CMOS may need to be
explored. The suitability of such devices to this field of computing would
strongly depend upon how closely their physical characteristics match with the
essential computing primitives employed in such models. In this work we discuss
the rationale of applying emerging spin-torque devices for bio-inspired
computing. Recent spin-torque experiments have shown the path to low-current,
low-voltage and high-speed magnetization switching in nano-scale magnetic
devices. Such magneto-metallic, current-mode spin-torque switches can mimic the
analog summing and thresholding operation of an artificial neuron with high
energy-efficiency. Comparison with CMOS-based analog circuit-model of neuron
shows that spin neurons can achieve more than two orders of magnitude lower
energy and beyond three orders of magnitude reduction in energy-delay product.
The application of spin neurons can therefore be an attractive option for
neuromorphic computers of future."
"Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in
non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has
brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been,
however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a
computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and
even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we
introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a
physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract
computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the
comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in
experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of
the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,
leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical
system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that
must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate
these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also
covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer
user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the
role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems."
"Future extreme-scale computer systems may expose silent data corruption (SDC)
to applications, in order to save energy or increase performance. However,
resilience research struggles to come up with useful abstract programming
models for reasoning about SDC. Existing work randomly flips bits in running
applications, but this only shows average-case behavior for a low-level,
artificial hardware model. Algorithm developers need to understand worst-case
behavior with the higher-level data types they actually use, in order to make
their algorithms more resilient. Also, we know so little about how SDC may
manifest in future hardware, that it seems premature to draw conclusions about
the average case. We argue instead that numerical algorithms can benefit from a
numerical unreliability fault model, where faults manifest as unbounded
perturbations to floating-point data. Algorithms can use inexpensive ""sanity""
checks that bound or exclude error in the results of computations. Given a
selective reliability programming model that requires reliability only when and
where needed, such checks can make algorithms reliable despite unbounded
faults. Sanity checks, and in general a healthy skepticism about the
correctness of subroutines, are wise even if hardware is perfectly reliable."
"Communication via diffusion (CvD) is an effective and energy efficient method
for transmitting information in nanonetworks. In this work, we focus on a
diffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an
absorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is
removed from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first
passage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only.
In 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time
distribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end
simulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive
symbols.
  In CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol
duration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main
challenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in
the following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.
End-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol
interference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI
cancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the
effect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are
considered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints
on transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a
carrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this
purpose. Results show that, the proposed ISI mitigation technique improves the
symbol detection performance and the amplitude-based modulations are improved
more than frequency-based modulations."
"Despite the intensive recent research on wireless single-channel full-duplex
communications, relatively little is known about the transceiver chain
nonidealities of full-duplex devices. In this paper, the effect of nonlinear
distortion occurring in the transmitter power amplifier (PA) and the receiver
chain is analyzed, alongside with the dynamic range requirements of
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This is done with detailed system
calculations, which combine the properties of the individual electronics
components to jointly model the complete transceiver chain, including
self-interference cancellation. They also quantify the decrease in the dynamic
range for the signal of interest caused by self-interference at the
analog-to-digital interface. Using these system calculations, we provide
comprehensive numerical results for typical transceiver parameters. The
analytical results are also confirmed with full waveform simulations. We
observe that the nonlinear distortion produced by the transmitter PA is a
significant issue in a full-duplex transceiver and, when using cheaper and less
linear components, also the receiver chain nonlinearities become considerable.
It is also shown that, with digitally-intensive self-interference cancellation,
the quantization noise of the ADCs is another significant problem."
"A plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a very large cell visible by unaided
eye. The plasmodium is capable for distributed sensing, parallel information
processing, and decentralized optimization. It is an ideal substrate for future
and emerging bio-computing devices. We study space-time dynamics of plasmodium
reactiom to localised illumination, and provide analogies between propagating
plasmodium and travelling wave-fragments in excitable media. We show how
plasmodium-based computing devices can be precisely controlled and shaped by
planar domains of illumination."
"We realize a biochemical filtering process by introducing a buffer in a
biocatalytic signal-transduction logic system based on the function of an
enzyme, esterase. The input, ethyl butyrate, is converted into butyric acid-the
output signal, which in turn is measured by the drop in the pH value. The
developed approach offers a versatile ""network element"" for increasing the
complexity of biochemical information processing systems. Evaluation of an
optimal regime for quality filtering is accomplished in the framework of a
kinetic rate-equation model."
"The present paper deals with the possibility of creation of the quantum
computer in which the role of q-bits is played by quasi-particles. In such a
computer, the elementary computation block should represent a cluster created
on the basis of the paramagnetic molecules. The latter form heterogeneous spin
states in the cluster owing to the presence of interelectron correlations."
"Current digital data storage systems are able to store huge amounts of data.
Even though the data density of digital information storage has increased
tremendously over the last few decades, the data longevity is limited to only a
few decades. If we want to preserve anything about the human race which can
outlast the human race itself, we require a data storage medium designed to
last for 1 million to 1 billion years. In this paper a medium is investigated
consisting of tungsten encapsulated by siliconnitride which, according to
elevated temperature tests, will last for well over the suggested time."
"We define a normal form for Clifford circuits, and we prove that every
Clifford operator has a unique normal form. Moreover, we present a rewrite
system by which any Clifford circuit can be reduced to normal form. This yields
a presentation of Clifford operators in terms of generators and relations."
"We demonstrate how a genetic ring oscillator network with quorum sensing
feedback can operate as a robust logic gate. Specifically we show how a range
of logic functions, namely AND/NAND, OR/NOR and XOR/XNOR, can be realized by
the system, thus yielding a versatile unit that can morph between different
logic operations. We further demonstrate the capacity of this system to yield
complementary logic operations in parallel. Our results then indicate the
computing potential of this biological system, and may lead to bio-inspired
computing devices."
"The Strukov model was the phenomenological model that accompanied the
announcement of the first recognised physical instantiation of the memristor
and, as such, it has been widely used. This model described the motion of a
boundary, $w$, between two types of inter-converting material,
$R_{\mathrm{off}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{on}}$, seemingly under a uniform field
across the entire device. In fact, what was intended was a field with a
discontinuity at $w$, that was uniform between $0<x<w$. In this paper we show
that the discontinuity is required for the Strukov model derivation to be
completed, and thus the derivation as given does not describe a situation with
a uniform field across the entire device. The discontinuity can be described as
a Heaviside function, $H$, located on $w$, for which there are three common
single-valued approximations for $H(w)$. The Strukov model as intended includes
an approximation for the Heaviside function (the field is taken to be the same
as that across the $R_{\mathrm{on}}$ part of the device). We compare
approximations and give solutions. We then extend the description of the field
to a more-realistic continuously varying sigmoidal transition between two
uniform fields and demonstrate that the centro-symmetric approximation model
(taking the field as being the average of the fields across $R_{\mathrm{on}}$
and $R_{\mathrm{off}}$) is a better single-point model of that situation: the
other two approximations over or underestimate the field."
"We define the Reflexive Tile Assembly Model (RTAM), which is obtained from
the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) by allowing tiles to reflect across
their horizontal and/or vertical axes. We show that the class of directed
temperature-1 RTAM systems is not computationally universal, which is
conjectured but unproven for the aTAM, and like the aTAM, the RTAM is
computationally universal at temperature 2. We then show that at temperature 1,
when starting from a single tile seed, the RTAM is capable of assembling n x n
squares for n odd using only n tile types, but incapable of assembling n x n
squares for n even. Moreover, we show that n is a lower bound on the number of
tile types needed to assemble n x n squares for n odd in the temperature-1
RTAM. The conjectured lower bound for temperature-1 aTAM systems is 2n-1.
Finally, we give preliminary results toward the classification of which finite
connected shapes in Z^2 can be assembled (strictly or weakly) by a singly
seeded (i.e. seed of size 1) RTAM system, including a complete classification
of which finite connected shapes be strictly assembled by a ""mismatch-free""
singly seeded RTAM system."
"Solving mazes is not just a fun pastime. Mazes are prototype models in graph
theory, topology, robotics, traffic optimization, psychology, and in many other
areas of science and technology. However, when maze complexity increases their
solution becomes cumbersome and very time consuming. Here, we show that a
network of memristors - resistors with memory - can solve such a non-trivial
problem quite easily. In particular, maze solving by the network of memristors
occurs in a massively parallel fashion since all memristors in the network
participate simultaneously in the calculation. The result of the calculation is
then recorded into the memristors' states, and can be used and/or recovered at
a later time. Furthermore, the network of memristors finds all possible
solutions in multiple-solution mazes, and sorts out the solution paths
according to their length. Our results demonstrate not only the first
application of memristive networks to the field of massively-parallel
computing, but also a novel algorithm to solve mazes which could find
applications in different research fields."
"We consider a basic model of digital memory where each cell is composed of a
reflecting medium with two possible reflectivities. By fixing the mean number
of photons irradiated over each memory cell, we show that a non-classical
source of light can retrieve more information than any classical source. This
improvement is shown in the regime of few photons and high reflectivities,
where the gain of information can be surprising. As a result, the use of
quantum light can have non-trivial applications in the technology of digital
memories, such as optical disks and barcodes."
"We consider a realization of the XOR logic gate in a process biocatalyzed by
an enzyme (here horseradish peroxidase: HRP), the function of which can be
inhibited by a substrate (hydrogen peroxide for HRP), when the latter is
inputted at large enough concentrations. A model is developed for describing
such systems in an approach suitable for evaluation of the analog noise
amplification properties of the gate. The obtained data are fitted for gate
quality evaluation within the developed model, and we discuss aspects of
devising XOR gates for functioning in ""biocomputing"" systems utilizing
biomolecules for information processing."
"Slime mould Physarum polycephalum builds up sophisticated networks to
transport nutrients between distant part of its extended body. The slime
mould's protoplasmic network is optimised for maximum coverage of nutrients yet
minimum energy spent on transportation of the intra-cellular material. In
laboratory experiments with P. polycephalum we represent Canadian major urban
areas with rolled oats and inoculated slime mould in the Toronto area. The
plasmodium spans the urban areas with its network of protoplasmic tubes. We
uncover similarities and differences between the protoplasmic network and the
Canadian national highway network, analyse the networks in terms of proximity
graphs and evaluate slime mould's network response to contamination."
"Magnetic data storage is pervasive in the preservation of digital information
and the rapid pace of computer development requires ever more capacity.
Increasing the storage density for magnetic hard disk drives requires a reduced
bit size, previously thought to be limited by the thermal stability of the
constituent magnetic grains. The limiting storage density in magnetic recording
is investigated treating the writing of bits as a thermodynamic process. A
'thermal writability' factor is introduced and it is shown that storage
densities will be limited to 15 to 20 TBit/in^2 unless technology can move
beyond the currently available write field magnitudes."
"This paper establishes a novel analytical approach to quantify robustness of
scheduling and battery management for battery supported cyber-physical systems.
A dynamic schedulability test is introduced to determine whether tasks are
schedulable within a finite time window. The test is used to measure robustness
of a real-time scheduling algorithm by evaluating the strength of computing
time perturbations that break schedulability at runtime. Robustness of battery
management is quantified analytically by an adaptive threshold on the state of
charge. The adaptive threshold significantly reduces the false alarm rate for
battery management algorithms to decide when a battery needs to be replaced."
"Spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is considered
as one of the most promising candidates to build up a true universal memory
thanks to its fast write/read speed, infinite endurance and non-volatility.
However the conventional access architecture based on 1 transistor + 1 memory
cell limits its storage density as the selection transistor should be large
enough to ensure the write current higher than the critical current for the STT
operation. This paper describes a design of cross-point architecture for
STT-MRAM. The mean area per word corresponds to only two transistors, which are
shared by a number of bits (e.g. 64). This leads to significant improvement of
data density (e.g. 1.75 F2/bit). Special techniques are also presented to
address the sneak currents and low speed issues of conventional cross-point
architecture, which are difficult to surmount and few efficient design
solutions have been reported in the literature. By using a STT-MRAM SPICE model
including precise experimental parameters and STMicroelectronics 65 nm
technology, some chip characteristic results such as cell area, data access
speed and power have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected
performances of this new memory architecture."
"Self-assembly is a fundamental process by which supramolecular species form
spontaneously from their components. This process is ubiquitous throughout the
life chemistry and is central to biological information processing. Algorithms
for solving many mathematical and computational problems via tile self assembly
have been proposed by many researchers in the last decade. In particular tile
set for doing basic arithmetic of two inputs have been given. In this work we
give tile set for doing basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication) of n inputs and subsequently computing its modulo. We also
present a tile set for primality testing. Finally we present a software
'xtilemod' for doing modular arithmetic. This simplifies the task of creating
the input files to xgrow simulator for doing basic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) as well as modular arithmetic of n inputs. Similar
software for creating tile set for primality testing is also given."
"In this paper, we have worked on reducing burden on mechanic involving
complex automobile maintenance activities that are performed in centralised
workshops. We have presented a system prototype that combines Augmented Reality
with Kinect. With the use of Kinect, very high quality sensors are available at
considerably low costs, thus reducing overall expenditure for system design.
The system can be operated either in Speech mode or in Gesture mode. The system
can be controlled by various audio commands if user opts for Speech mode. The
same controlling can also be done by using a set of Gestures in Gesture mode.
  Gesture recognition is the task performed by Kinect system. This system,
bundled with RGB and Depth camera, processes the skeletal data by keeping track
of 20 different body joints. Recognizing Gestures is done by verifying user
movements and checking them against predefined condition. Augmented Reality
module captures real-time image data streams from high resolution camera. This
module then generates 3D model that is superimposed on real time data."
"We contribute a 2D nearest-neighbor quantum architecture for Shor's algorithm
to factor an $n$-bit number in $O(\log^2(n))$ depth. Our implementation uses
parallel phase estimation, constant-depth fanout and teleportation, and
constant-depth carry-save modular addition. We derive upper bounds on the
circuit resources of our architecture under a new 2D nearest-neighbor model
which allows a classical controller and parallel, communicating modules. We
also contribute a novel constant-depth circuit for unbounded quantum unfanout
in our new model. Finally, we provide a comparison to all previous
nearest-neighbor factoring implementations. Our circuit results in an
exponential improvement in nearest-neighbor circuit depth at the cost of a
polynomial increase in circuit size and width."
"Titanium dioxide sol-gel memristors have two different modes of operation,
believed to be dependent on whether there is bulk memristance, i.e. memristance
throughout the whole volume or filamentary memristance, i.e. memristance caused
by the connection of conducting filaments. The mem-con theory of memristance is
based on the drift of oxygen vacancies rather than that of conducting electrons
and has been previously used to describe bulk memristance in several devices.
Here, the mem-con theory is extended to model memristance caused by small
filaments of low resistance titanium dioxide and it compares favorably to
experimental results for filamentary memristance in sol-gel devices."
"The width of the electrodes is not included in the current phenomenological
models of memristance, but is included in the memory-conservation (mem-con)
theory of memristance. An experimental study of the effect of changing the top
electrode width was performed on titanium dioxide sol-gel memristors. It was
demonstrated that both the on resistance, Ron, and the off resistance, Roff,
decreased with increasing electrode size. The memory function part of the
mem-con model could fit the relationship between Ron and electrode size.
Similarly, the conservation function fits the change in Roff. The
experimentally measured hysteresis did not fit the phenomenological model's
predictions. Instead the size of the hysteresis increased with increasing
electrode size, and correlated well to decreasing Ron."
"Reservoir computing is a new, powerful and flexible machine learning
technique that is easily implemented in hardware. Recently, by using a
time-multiplexed architecture, hardware reservoir computers have reached
performance comparable to digital implementations. Operating speeds allowing
for real time information operation have been reached using optoelectronic
systems. At present the main performance bottleneck is the readout layer which
uses slow, digital postprocessing. We have designed an analog readout suitable
for time-multiplexed optoelectronic reservoir computers, capable of working in
real time. The readout has been built and tested experimentally on a standard
benchmark task. Its performance is better than non-reservoir methods, with
ample room for further improvement. The present work thereby overcomes one of
the major limitations for the future development of hardware reservoir
computers."
"A noncooperative game theoretical approach for analysing opportunistic
spectrum access (OSA) in cognitive radio (CR) environments is proposed. New
concepts from game theory are applied to spectrum access analysis in order to
extract rules of behaviour for an emerging environment. In order to assess OSA
scenarios of CRs, two oligopoly game models are reformulated in terms of
resource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed:
simultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and
asymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access
(licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game
solutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter
captures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting
different types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic
modelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium
detection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of
channels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium
describes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable
solutions. The analysis of the Stackelberg modelling shows that payoffs are
maximised for all users if the incumbents are Nash oriented and the new
entrants are Pareto driven."
"Finite fields of the form GF(2^m) play an important role in coding theory and
cryptography. We show that the choice of how to represent the elements of these
fields can have a significant impact on the resource requirements for quantum
arithmetic. In particular, we show how the use of Gaussian normal basis
representations and of `ghost-bit basis' representations can be used to
implement inverters with a quantum circuit of depth O(m log(m)). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first construction with subquadratic depth reported
in the literature. Our quantum circuit for the computation of multiplicative
inverses is based on the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm which exploits that in normal
basis representation squaring corresponds to a permutation of the coefficients.
We give resource estimates for the resulting quantum circuit for inversion over
binary fields GF(2^m) based on an elementary gate set that is useful for
fault-tolerant implementation."
"Elliptic curves over finite fields GF(2^n) play a prominent role in modern
cryptography. Published quantum algorithms dealing with such curves build on a
short Weierstrass form in combination with affine or projective coordinates. In
this paper we show that changing the curve representation allows a substantial
reduction in the number of T-gates needed to implement the curve arithmetic. As
a tool, we present a quantum circuit for computing multiplicative inverses in
GF(2^n) in depth O(n log n) using a polynomial basis representation, which may
be of independent interest."
"For over a decade, the hypercomputation movement has produced computational
models that in theory solve the algorithmically unsolvable, but they are not
physically realizable according to currently accepted physical theories. While
opponents to the hypercomputation movement provide arguments against the
physical realizability of specific models in order to demonstrate this, these
arguments lack the generality to be a satisfactory justification against the
construction of \emph{any} information-processing machine that computes beyond
the universal Turing machine. To this end, I present a more mathematically
concrete challenge to hypercomputability, and will show that one is immediately
led into physical impossibilities, thereby demonstrating the infeasibility of
hypercomputers more generally. This gives impetus to propose and justify a more
plausible starting point for an extension to the classical paradigm that is
physically possible, at least in principle. Instead of attempting to rely on
infinities such as idealized limits of infinite time or numerical precision, or
some other physically unattainable source, one should focus on extending the
classical paradigm to better encapsulate modern computational problems that are
not well-expressed/modeled by the closed-system paradigm of the Turing machine.
I present the first steps toward this goal by considering contemporary
computational problems dealing with intractability and issues surrounding
cyber-physical systems, and argue that a reasonable extension to the classical
paradigm should focus on these issues in order to be practically viable."
"Over the past several years, DNA sequencing has emerged as one of the driving
forces in life-sciences, paving the way for affordable and accurate whole
genome sequencing. As genomes represent the entirety of an organism's
hereditary information, the availability of complete human genomes prompts a
wide range of revolutionary applications. The hope for improving modern
healthcare and better understanding the human genome propels many interesting
and challenging research frontiers. Unfortunately, however, the proliferation
of human genomes amplifies worrisome privacy concerns, since a genome
represents a treasure trove of highly personal and sensitive information. In
this article, we provide an overview of positive results and biomedical
advances in the field, and discuss privacy issues associated with human genomic
information. Finally, we survey available privacy-enhancing technologies and
list a number of open research challenges."
"Herein, we present a detailed analysis of an eigenvalue based sensing
technique in the presence of correlated noise in the context of a Cognitive
Radio (CR). We use a Standard Condition Number (SCN) based decision statistic
based on asymptotic Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for decision process. Firstly,
the effect of noise correlation on eigenvalue based Spectrum Sensing (SS) is
studied analytically under both the noise only and the signal plus noise
hypotheses. Secondly, new bounds for the SCN are proposed for achieving
improved sensing in correlated noise scenarios. Thirdly, the performance of
Fractional Sampling (FS) based SS is studied and a method for determining the
operating point for the FS rate in terms of sensing performance and complexity
is suggested. Finally, an SNR estimation technique based on the maximum
eigenvalue of the received signal's covariance matrix is proposed. It is shown
that proposed SCN-based threshold improves sensing performance in the presence
of correlated noise and SNRs upto 0 dB can be reliably estimated without the
knowledge of noise variance."
"Spiking Neural P systems, SNP systems for short, are biologically inspired
computing devices based on how neurons perform computations. SNP systems use
only one type of symbol, the spike, in the computations. Information is encoded
in the time differences of spikes or the multiplicity of spikes produced at
certain times. SNP systems with delays (associated with rules) and those
without delays are two of several Turing complete SNP system variants in
literature. In this work we investigate how restricted forms of SNP systems
with delays can be simulated by SNP systems without delays. We show the
simulations for the following spike routing constructs: sequential, iteration,
join, and split."
"Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error
correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer
formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators
that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting
of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on
conventional computers using Omega(n^2) bits, where n is the number of qubits.
Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have
been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer
states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for:
(i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining
canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between
stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general,
but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC
(e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly
4(2^n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim
experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing
arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms
to compute the inner product between two such frames."
"The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a suitable candidate organism for
soft-matter robotics because it exhibits controllable transport, movement and
guidance behaviour. Physarum may be considered as a smart computing and
actuating material since both its motor and control systems are distributed
within its undifferentiated tissue and can survive trauma such as excision,
fission and fusion of plasmodia. Thus it may be suitable for exploring the
generation and distribution of micro-actuation in individual units or planar
arrays. We experimentally show how the plasmodium of Physarum is shaped to
execute controllable oscillatory transport behaviour applicable in small hybrid
engines. We measure the lifting force of the plasmodium and demonstrate how
protoplasmic transport can be influenced by externally applied illumination
stimuli. We provide an exemplar vehicle mechanism by coupling the oscillations
of the plasmodium to drive the wheels of a Braitenberg vehicle and use light
stimuli to effect a steering mechanism. Using a particle model of Physarum we
show how emergent travelling wave patterns produced by competing oscillatory
domains may be used to to generate spatially represented actuation patterns. We
demonstrate different patterns of controllable motion, including linear,
reciprocal, rotational and helical, and demonstrate in simulation how dynamic
oscillatory patterns may be translated into motive forces for simple transport
of substances within a patterned environment."
"A gas free analogue of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction catalysed by ferroin
and encapsulated in phospholipid stabilised vesicles is reported. A reaction
mixture which exhibits spontaneous oscillation and excitation transfer between
vesicles was formulated. By adjusting the reagent concentrations a quiescent
state with fewer spontaneous oscillations was achieved. Using relatively low
power laser sources of specific wavelengths (green 532nm and blue 405nm) it was
shown that waves could be reproducibly initiated within the BZ vesicles.
Furthermore, despite the reduced excitability of the system overall the
initiated waves exhibited vesicle to vesicle transfer. It was possible to
manipulate single vesicles and design simple circuits based on a 2D validation
of collision based circuits. Therefore, we conclude that this BZ system
exhibits promise for computing applications based on 3D networks of vesicles."
"This paper provides an analysis of patent activity in the field of quantum
information processing. Data from the PatentScope database from the years
1993-2011 was used. In order to predict the future trends in the number of
filed patents time series models were used."
"In this work we extend and improve the results done in a previous work on
simulating Spiking Neural P systems (SNP systems in short) with delays using
SNP systems without delays. We simulate the former with the latter over
sequential, iteration, join, and split routing. Our results provide
constructions so that both systems halt at exactly the same time, start with
only one spike, and produce the same number of spikes to the environment after
halting."
"Bio-Inspired Algorithms on Road Traffic Congestion and safety is a very
promising research problem. Searching for an efficient optimization method to
increase the degree of speed optimization and thereby increasing the traffic
Flow in an unplanned zone is a widely concerning issue. However, there has been
a limited research effort on the optimization of the lane usage with speed
optimization. The main objective of this article is to find avenues or
techniques in a novel way to solve the problem optimally using the knowledge
from analysis of speeds of vehicles, which, in turn will act as a guide for
design of lanes optimally to provide better optimized traffic. The accident
factors adjust the base model estimates for individual geometric design element
dimensions and for traffic control features. The application of these
algorithms in partially modified form in accordance of this novel Speed
Optimization Technique in an Unplanned Traffic analysis technique is applied to
the proposed design and speed optimization plan. The experimental results based
on real life data are quite encouraging."
"A \beta-skeleton is a proximity undirected graph whose connectivity is
determined by the parameter \beta. We study \beta-skeleton automata where every
node is a finite state machine taking two states, and updating its states
depending on the states of adjacent automata-nodes. We allow automata-nodes to
remember their previous states. In computational experiments we study how
memory affects the global space-time dynamics on \beta-skeleton automata."
"All-spin logic devices are promising candidates to augment and complement
beyond-CMOS integrated circuit computing due to non-volatility, ultra-low
operating voltages, higher logical efficiency, and high density integration.
However, the path to reach lower energy-delay product performance compared to
CMOS transistors currently is not clear. We show that scaling and engineering
the nanoscale magnetic materials and interfaces is the key to realizing spin
logic devices that can surpass energy-delay performance of CMOS transistors.
With validated stochastic nano-magnetic and vector spin transport numerical
models, we derive the target material and interface properties for the
nanomagnets and channels. We identified promising new directions for material
engineering/discovery focusing on systematic scaling of magnetic anisotropy
(Hk) with saturation magnetization (Ms), use of perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, and interface spin mixing conductance of ferromagnet/spin channel
interface (Gmix). We provide systematic targets for scaling spin logic
energy-delay product toward a 2 aJ.ns energy-delay product, comprehending the
stochastic noise for nanomagnets."
"A major obstacle to implementing Shor's quantum number-factoring algorithm is
the large size of modular-exponentiation circuits. We reduce this bottleneck by
customizing reversible circuits for modular multiplication to individual runs
of Shor's algorithm. Our circuit-synthesis procedure exploits spectral
properties of multiplication operators and constructs optimized circuits from
the traces of the execution of an appropriate GCD algorithm. Empirically, gate
counts are reduced by 4-5 times, and circuit latency is reduced by larger
factors."
"We undertook a study of the use of a memristor network for music generation,
making use of the memristor's memory to go beyond the Markov hypothesis. Seed
transition matrices are created and populated using memristor equations, and
which are shown to generate musical melodies and change in style over time as a
result of feedback into the transition matrix. The spiking properties of simple
memristor networks are demonstrated and discussed with reference to
applications of music making. The limitations of simulating composing memristor
networks in von Neumann hardware is discussed and a hardware solution based on
physical memristor properties is presented."
"Energy Harvesting (EH) is a novel technique to prolong the lifetime of the
wireless networks such as wireless sensor networks or Ad-Hoc networks, by
providing an unlimited source of energy for their nodes. In this sense, it has
emerged as a promising technique for Green Communications, recently. On the
other hand, cooperative communication with the help of relay nodes improves the
performance of wireless communication networks by increasing the system
throughput or the reliability as well as the range and efficient energy
utilization. In order to investigate the cooperation in EH nodes, in this
paper, we consider the problem of optimal power and rate allocation in the
degraded full-duplex Gaussian relay channel in which source and relay can
harvest energy from their environments. We consider the general stochastic
energy arrivals at the source and the relay with known EH times and amounts at
the transmitters before the start of transmission. This problem has a min-max
optimization form that along with the constraints is not easy to solve. We
propose a method based on a mathematical theorem proposed by Terkelsen [1] to
transform it to a solvable convex optimization form. Also, we consider some
special cases for the harvesting profile of the source and the relay nodes and
find their solutions efficiently."
"In this paper, novel enhanced Cognitive Radio Network is considered by using
power control where secondary users are allowed to use wireless resources of
the primary users when primary users are deactivated, but also allow secondary
users to coexist with primary users while primary users are activated by
managing interference caused from secondary users to primary users. Therefore,
a novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is
proposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced
cognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under
two cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference
(SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for
increasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within
finite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed
scheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher
target SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower
value for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In
order to mitigate the attenuation of SIR due to channel uncertainties the
proposed novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation
allows the SIR of both primary users' and secondary users' to converge to a
desired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite
horizon. Simulation results illustrate that this novel finite horizon adaptive
optimal distributed power allocation scheme can converge much faster and cost
less energy than others by adapting to the channel variations optimally."
"In this letter, we present an original demonstration of an associative
learning neural network inspired by the famous Pavlov's dogs experiment. A
single nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor (NOMFET) is used to
implement each synapse. We show how the physical properties of this dynamic
memristive device can be used to perform low power write operations for the
learning and implement short-term association using temporal coding and spike
timing dependent plasticity based learning. An electronic circuit was built to
validate the proposed learning scheme with packaged devices, with good
reproducibility despite the complex synaptic-like dynamic of the NOMFET in
pulse regime."
"Huffman Compression, also known as Huffman Coding, is one of many compression
techniques in use today. The two important features of Huffman coding are
instantaneousness that is the codes can be interpreted as soon as they are
received and variable length that is a most frequent symbol has length smaller
than a less frequent symbol. The traditional Huffman coding has two procedures:
constructing a tree in O(n^2) and then traversing it in O(n). Quantum computing
is a promising approach of computation that is based on equations from Quantum
Mechanics. Instantaneousness and variable length features are difficult to
generalize to the quantum case. The quantum coding field is pioneered by
Schumacher works on block coding scheme. To encode N signals sequentially, it
requires O(N3) computational steps. The encoding and decoding processes are far
from instantaneous. Moreover, the lengths of all the codewords are the same. A
Huffman-coding-inspired scheme for the storage of quantum information takes
O(N(log N)a) computational steps for a sequential implementation on
non-parallel machines."
"Quantum computing is a promising approach of computation that is based on
equations from Quantum Mechanics. A simulator for quantum algorithms must be
capable of performing heavy mathematical matrix transforms. The design of the
simulator itself takes one of three forms: Quantum Turing Machine, Network
Model or circuit model of connected gates or, Quantum Programming Language,
yet, some simulators are hybrid. We studied previous simulators and then we
adopt features from three simulators of different implementation languages,
different paradigms, and for different platforms. They are Quantum Computing
Language (QCL), QUASI, and Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab 5. Our simulator
for quantum algorithms takes the form of a package or a programming library for
Quantum computing, with a case study showing the ability of using it in the
circuit model. The .NET is a promising platform for computing. VB.NET is an
easy, high productive programming language with the full power and
functionality provided by the .NET framework. It is highly readable, writeable,
and flexible language, compared to another language such as C#.NET in many
aspects. We adopted VB.NET although its shortage in built-in mathematical
complex and matrix operations, compared to Matlab. For implementation, we first
built a mathematical core of matrix operations. Then, we built a quantum core
which contains: basic qubits and register operations, basic 1D, 2D, and 3D
quantum gates, and multi-view visualization of the quantum state, then a window
for demos to show you how to use and get the most of the package."
"A rotation-based synthesis framework for reversible logic is proposed. We
develop a canonical representation based on binary decision diagrams and
introduce operators to manipulate the developed representation model.
Furthermore, a recursive functional bi-decomposition approach is proposed to
automatically synthesize a given function. While Boolean reversible logic is
particularly addressed, our framework constructs intermediate quantum states
that may be in superposition, hence we combine techniques from reversible
Boolean logic and quantum computation. The proposed approach results in
quadratic gate count for multiple-control Toffoli gates without ancillae,
linear depth for quantum carry-ripple adder, and quasilinear size for quantum
multiplexer."
"Orientation and Motion Sensing are widely implemented on various consumer
products, such as mobile phones, tablets and cameras as they enable immediate
interaction with virtual information. The prototyping phase of any orientation
and motion sensing capable device is however a quite difficult process as it
may involve complex hardware designing, math algorithms and programming.
  In this paper, we present FreeIMU, an Open Hardware Framework for prototyping
orientation and motion sensing capable devices. The framework consists in a
small circuit board containing various sensors and a software library, built on
top of the Arduino platform. Both the hardware and library are released under
open licences and supported by an active community allowing to be implemented
into research and commercial projects."
"We show that memristive networks-namely networks of resistors with memory-can
efficiently solve shortest-path optimization problems. Indeed, the presence of
memory (time non-locality) promotes self organization of the network into the
shortest possible path(s). We introduce a network entropy function to
characterize the self-organized evolution, show the solution of the
shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the solution
path. Finally, we provide an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem.
Similar considerations apply to networks of memcapacitors and meminductors, and
networks with memory in various dimensions."
"The field of quantum algorithms is vibrant. Still, there is currently a lack
of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical
scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by
introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum
programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of
non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations
using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses
a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any
particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to
use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum
algorithms."
"The idea of changing our energy system from a hierarchical design into a set
of nearly independent microgrids becomes feasible with the availability of
small renewable energy generators. The smart microgrid concept comes with
several challenges in research and engineering targeting load balancing,
pricing, consumer integration and home automation. In this paper we first
provide an overview on these challenges and present approaches that target the
problems identified. While there exist promising algorithms for the particular
field, we see a missing integration which specifically targets smart
microgrids. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates the presented
approaches and defines interfaces between the identified components such as
generators, storage, smart and \dq{dumb} devices."
"Quipper is a recently developed programming language for expressing quantum
computations. This paper gives a brief tutorial introduction to the language,
through a demonstration of how to make use of some of its key features. We
illustrate many of Quipper's language features by developing a few well known
examples of Quantum computation, including quantum teleportation, the quantum
Fourier transform, and a quantum circuit for addition."
"In cognitive radio networks, spectrum sensing is a crucial technique to
discover spectrum opportunities for the Secondary Users (SUs). The quality of
spectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency.
Here, sensing accuracy is represented by the false alarm probability and the
detection probability while sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing
overhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based
cooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses
the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the
cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each
team senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint
detection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an
available channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an
SU-selecting algorithm is presented to selectively choose the cooperative SUs
based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is
built to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of
channel conditions: time-invariant channel and time-varying channel. An
optimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to
optimize the important design parameters. Both saturation and non-saturation
situations are investigated with respect to throughput and sensing overhead.
Simulation results indicate that the proposed protocol is able to significantly
decrease sensing overhead and increase network throughput with guaranteed
sensing accuracy."
"Indoor localization systems that are accurate and robust with respect to
propagation channel conditions are still a technical challenge today. In
particular, for systems based on range measurements from radio signals,
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations can result in large position errors. In
this paper, we address these issues using measurements in a representative
indoor environment. Results show that conventional tracking schemes using high-
and a low-complexity ranging algorithms are strongly impaired by NLOS
conditions unless a very large signal bandwidth is used. Furthermore, we
discuss and evaluate the performance of multipath-assisted indoor navigation
and tracking (MINT), that can overcome these impairments by making use of
multipath propagation. Across a wide range of bandwidths, MINT shows superior
performance compared to conventional schemes, and virtually no degradation in
its robustness due to NLOS conditions."
"This paper studies the mitigation of intersymbol interference in a diffusive
molecular communication system using enzymes that freely diffuse in the
propagation environment. The enzymes form reaction intermediates with
information molecules and then degrade them so that they cannot interfere with
future transmissions. A lower bound expression on the expected number of
molecules measured at the receiver is derived. A simple binary receiver
detection scheme is proposed where the number of observed molecules is sampled
at the time when the maximum number of molecules is expected. Insight is also
provided into the selection of an appropriate bit interval. The expected bit
error probability is derived as a function of the current and all previously
transmitted bits. Simulation results show the accuracy of the bit error
probability expression and the improvement in communication performance by
having active enzymes present."
"Context-consistency checking is challenging in the dynamic and uncertain
ubiquitous computing environments. This is because contexts are often noisy
owing to unreliable sensing data streams, inaccurate data measurement, fragile
connectivity and resource constraints. One of the state-of-the-art efforts is
CEDA, which concurrently detects context consistency by exploring the
\emph{happened-before} relation among events. However, CEDA is seriously
limited by several side effects --- centralized detection manner that easily
gets down the checker process, heavy computing complexity and false negative.
  In this paper, we propose SECA: Snapshot-based Event Detection for Checking
Asynchronous Context Consistency in ubiquitous computing. SECA introduces
snapshot-based timestamp to check event relations, which can detect scenarios
where CEDA fails. Moreover, it simplifies the logical clock instead of adopting
the vector clock, and thus significantly reduces both time and space
complexity. Empirical studies show that SECA outperforms CEDA in terms of
detection accuracy, scalability, and computing complexity."
"This paper presents Telebrain, a browser-based performatization platform
invented for organizing real-time telematic performances. Performatization is
the human performance of algorithms. When computers and humans performatize

"Slime mould P. polycephalum is a single cells visible by unaided eye. The
cells shows a wide spectrum of intelligent behaviour. By interpreting the
behaviour in terms of computation one can make a slime mould based computing
device. The Physarum computers are capable to solve a range of tasks of
computational geometry, optimisation and logic. Physarum computers designed so
far lack of localised inputs. Commonly used inputs --- illumination and
chemo-attractants and -repellents --- usually act on extended domains of the
slime mould's body. Aiming to design massive-parallel tactile inputs for slime
mould computers we analyse a temporal dynamic of P. polycephalum's electrical
response to tactile stimulation. In experimental laboratory studies we discover
how the Physarum responds to application and removal of a local mechanical
pressure with electrical potential impulses and changes in its electrical
potential oscillation patterns."
"Improving over an earlier construction by Kaye and Zalka, Maslov et al.
describe an implementation of Shor's algorithm which can solve the discrete
logarithm problem on binary elliptic curves in quadratic depth O(n^2). In this
paper we show that discrete logarithms on such curves can be found with a
quantum circuit of depth O(log^2 n). As technical tools we introduce quantum
circuits for GF(2^n) multiplication in depth O(log n) and for GF(2^n) inversion
in depth O(log^2 n)."
"In laboratory experiments we demonstrate that protoplasmic tubes of acellular
slime mould \emph{Physarum polycephalum} show current versus voltage profiles
consistent with memristive systems and that the effect is due to the living
protoplasm of the mould. This complements previous findings on memristive
properties of other living systems (human skin and blood) and contributes to
development of self-growing bio-electronic circuits. Distinctive asymmetric
$V$-$I$ curves which were occasionally observed when the internal current is on
the same order as the driven current, are well-modelled by the concept of
active memristors."
"We present a new approach for the design of a synthetic biological circuit
whose behaviour is specified in terms of signal temporal logic (STL) formulae.
We first show how to characterise with STL formulae the input/output behaviour
of biological modules miming the classical logical gates (AND, NOT, OR). Hence,
we provide the regions of the parameter space for which these specifications
are satisfied. Given a STL specification of the target circuit to be designed
and the networks of its constituent components, we propose a methodology to
constrain the behaviour of each module, then identifying the subset of the
parameter space in which those constraints are satisfied, providing also a
measure of the robustness for the target circuit design. This approach, which
leverages recent results on the quantitative semantics of Signal Temporal
Logic, is illustrated by synthesising a biological implementation of an
half-adder."
"The present von Neumann computing paradigm involves a significant amount of
information transfer between a central processing unit (CPU) and memory, with
concomitant limitations in the actual execution speed. However, it has been
recently argued that a different form of computation, dubbed memcomputing
[Nature Physics, 9, 200-202 (2013)] and inspired by the operation of our brain,
can resolve the intrinsic limitations of present day architectures by allowing
for computing and storing of information on the same physical platform. Here we
show a simple and practical realization of memcomputing that utilizes
easy-to-build memcapacitive systems. We name this architecture Dynamic
Computing Random Access Memory (DCRAM). We show that DCRAM provides
massively-parallel and polymorphic digital logic, namely it allows for
different logic operations with the same architecture, by varying only the
control signals. In addition, by taking into account realistic parameters, its
energy expenditures can be as low as a few fJ per operation. DCRAM is fully
compatible with CMOS technology, can be realized with current fabrication
facilities, and therefore can really serve as an alternative to the present
computing technology."
"We propose magnetic threshold-logic (MTL) design based on non-volatile
spin-torque switches. A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs summation of
multiple inputs multiplied by a fixed set of weights and compares the sum with
a threshold. MTL employs resistive states of magnetic tunnel junctions as
programmable input weights, while, a low-voltage domain-wall shift based
spin-torque switch is used for thresholding operation. The resulting MTL gate
acts as a low-power, configurable logic unit and can be used to build fully
pipelined, high-performance programmable computing blocks. Multiple stages in
such a MTL design can be connected using energy-efficient ultralow swing
programmable interconnect networks based on resistive switches. Owing to
memory-based compact logic and interconnect design and low-voltage, high-speed
spintorque based threshold operation, MTL can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude improvement in energy-delay product as compared to look-up table
based CMOS FPGA."
"We propose dynamic resistive threshold-logic (DRTL) design based on
non-volatile resistive memory. A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs summation
of multiple inputs multiplied by a fixed set of weights and compares the sum
with a threshold. DRTL employs resistive memory elements to implement the
weights and the thresholds, while a compact dynamic CMOS latch is used for the
comparison operation. The resulting DRTL gate acts as a low-power, configurable
dynamic logic unit and can be used to build fully pipelined, high-performance
programmable computing blocks. Multiple stages in such a DRTL design can be
connected using energy-efficient low swing programmable interconnect networks
based on resistive switches. Owing to memory-based compact logic and
interconnect design and highspeed dynamic-pipelined operation, DRTL can achieve
more than two orders of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product as
compared to look-up table based CMOS FPGA."
"Green communication attracts increasing research interest recently. Equipped
with a rechargeable battery, a source node can harvest energy from ambient
environments and rely on this free and regenerative energy supply to transmit
packets. Due to the uncertainty of available energy from harvesting, however,
intolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source
always waits for harvested energy. To overcome this problem, one Reliable
Energy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged
packets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay
and power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal
scheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a
capacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The
proposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and
resorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing
processes, with an average power constraint from the RES. Through
twodimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming formulation, we
derive the optimal threshold-based scheduling policy together with the
corresponding transmission parameters. Our study includes three exemplary cases
that capture some important relations between the data packet arrival process
and energy harvesting capability. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated by
simulation results."
"In solid_state hybrid electron_nuclear spin systems quantum entanglement
plays vital role in allowing accessible transfer of information between
subatomic particles, regardless of the host lattice coordination spatial
geometry, revealing the powerful resource for nuclear quantum states
engineering. Here we present study of 2 MeV superfocused channeled proton (SCP)
beam induced polarization of atom_photon correlated states, established in
isotopically purified silicon nanocrystal. Two level entangling interaction
which couples an initial quantum state to two possible light_matter states via
silicon nanocrystal interface is presented. The anisotropic hyperfine coupling
is demonstrated by strong mixing of quantum states within the control mechanism
of the coherent proton pulse sequence. Obtained results reveal the mutual
predictable correlation of particles of energy_matter, by using the fully
broadcastable and precise hybrid electron_nuclear spin qubit manipulations
which can be exploited for the speed_superior communication channels keeping at
the same time the maximum degree of data preservation."
"The limited spectrum resources and dramatic growth of high data rate
communications have motivated opportunistic spectrum access using the promising
concept of cognitive radio networks. Although this concept has emerged
primarily to enhance spectrum utilization, the importance of energy consumption
poses new challenges, because energy efficiency and communication performance
can be at odds. In this paper, the existing approaches to energy efficiency
spectrum sensing and handoff are classified. The tradeoff between energy
consumption and throughput is established as function of the numerous design
parameters of cognitive radio networks, both in the case of local and of
cooperative spectrum sensing. It is argued that a number of important aspects
still needs to be researched, such as fairness, dynamic behavior, reactive and
proactive schemes for energy efficiency."
"Acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a popular now user-friendly
living substrate for designing of future and emergent sensing and computing
devices. P. polycephalum exhibits regular patterns of oscillations of its
surface electrical potential. The oscillation patterns are changed when the
slime mould is subjected to mechanical, chemical, electrical or optical
stimuli. We evaluate feasibility of slime-mould based colour sensors by
illuminating Physarum with red, green, blue and white colours and analysing
patterns of the slime mould's electrical potential oscillations. We define that
the slime mould recognises a colour if it reacts to illumination with the
colour by a unique changes in amplitude and periods of oscillatory activity. In
laboratory experiments we found that the slime mould recognises red and blue
colour. The slime mould does not differentiate between green and white colours.
The slime mould also recognises when red colour is switched off. We also map
colours to diversity of the oscillations: illumination with a white colour
increases diversity of amplitudes and periods of oscillations, other colours
studied increase diversity either of amplitude or period."
"We experimentally derived a unique one-to-one mapping between a range of
selected bioactive chemicals and patterns of oscillations of the slime mould's
extacellular electrical potential."
"There are three theoretical models which purport to relate
experimentally-measurable or fabrication-controllable device properties to the
memristor's operation: 1. Strukov et al's phenomenological model; 2. Georgiou
et al's Bernoulli rewrite of that phenomenological model; 3. Gale's
memory-conservation model. They differ in their prediction of the effect on
memristance of changing the electrode size and factors that affect the
hysteresis. Using a batch of TiO$_2$ sol-gel memristors fabricated with
different top electrode widths we test and compare these three theories. It was
found that, contrary to model 2's prediction, the `dimensionless lumped
parameter', $\beta$, did not correlate to any measure of the hysteresis.
Contrary to model 1, memristance was found to be dependent on the three spatial
dimensions of the TiO$_2$ layer, as was predicted by model 3. Model 3 was found
to fit the change in resistance value with electrode size. Simulations using
model 3 and experimentally derived values for contact resistance gave
hysteresis values that were linearly related to (and only one order of
magnitude out) from the experimentally-measured values. Memristor hysteresis
was found to be related to the ON state resistance and thus the electrode size
(as those two are related). These results offer a verification of the
memory-conservation theory of memristance and its association of the vacancy
magnetic flux with the missing magnetic flux in memristor theory. This is the
first paper to experimentally test various theories pertaining to the operation
of memristor devices."
"It is not always possible for a robot to process all the information from its
sensors in a timely manner and thus quick and yet valid approximations of the
robot's situation are needed. Here we design hybrid control for a robot within
this limit using algorithms inspired by ant worker placement behaviour and
based on memristor-based non-linearity."
"Time perception is essential for task switching, and in the mammalian brain
appears alongside other processes. Memristors are electronic components used as
synapses and as models for neurons. The d.c. response of memristors can be
considered as a type of short-term memory. Interactions of the memristor d.c.
response within networks of memristors leads to the emergence of oscillatory
dynamics and intermittent spike trains, which are similar to neural dynamics.
Based on this data, the structure of a memristor network control for a robot as
it undergoes task switching is discussed and it is suggested that these
emergent network dynamics could improve the performance of role switching and
learning in an artificial intelligence and perhaps create artificial time
perception."
"A memristor is often identified by showing its distinctive pinched hysteresis
curve and testing for the effect of frequency. The hysteresis size should
relate to frequency and shrink to zero as the frequency approaches infinity.
Although mathematically understood, the material causes for this are not well
known. The d.c. response of the memristor is a decaying curve with its own
timescale. We show via mathematical reasoning that this decaying curve when
transformed to a.c. leads to the frequency effect by considering a descretized
curve. We then demonstrate the validity of this approach with experimental data
from two different types of memristors."
"Memristors have been suggested as neuromorphic computing elements. Spike-time
dependent plasticity and the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron have both been
modelled effectively by memristor theory. The d.c. response of the memristor is
a current spike. Based on these three facts we suggest that memristors are
well-placed to interface directly with neurons. In this paper we show that
connecting a spiking memristor network to spiking neuronal cells causes a
change in the memristor network dynamics by: removing the memristor spikes,
which we show is due to the effects of connection to aqueous medium; causing a
change in current decay rate consistent with a change in memristor state;
presenting more-linear $I-t$ dynamics; and increasing the memristor spiking
rate, as a consequence of interaction with the spiking neurons. This
demonstrates that neurons are capable of communicating directly with
memristors, without the need for computer translation."
"Memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing
based on the similarity between neurons (synapses and ion pumps) and
memristors. The D.C. action of the memristor is a current spike, which we think
will be fruitful for building memristor computers. In this paper, we introduce
4 different logical assignations to implement sequential logic in the memristor
and introduce the physical rules, summation, `bounce-back', directionality and
`diminishing returns', elucidated from our investigations. We then demonstrate
how memristor sequential logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate
and a Full Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the
memristor's memory to add three binary values together and outputs the value,
the carry digit and even the order they were input in."
"Languages, compilers, and computer-aided design tools will be essential for
scalable quantum computing, which promises an exponential leap in our ability
to execute complex tasks. LIQUi|> is a modular software architecture designed
to control quantum hardware. It enables easy programming, compilation, and
simulation of quantum algorithms and circuits, and is independent of a specific
quantum architecture. LIQUi|> contains an embedded, domain-specific language
designed for programming quantum algorithms, with F# as the host language. It
also allows the extraction of a circuit data structure that can be used for
optimization, rendering, or translation. The circuit can also be exported to
external hardware and software environments. Two different simulation
environments are available to the user which allow a trade-off between number
of qubits and class of operations. LIQUi|> has been implemented on a wide range
of runtimes as back-ends with a single user front-end. We describe the
significant components of the design architecture and how to express any given
quantum algorithm."
"In this paper we define the Dupled abstract Tile Assembly Model (DaTAM),
which is a slight extension to the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) that
allows for not only the standard square tiles, but also ""duple"" tiles which are
rectangles pre-formed by the joining of two square tiles. We show that the
addition of duples allows for powerful behaviors of self-assembling systems at
temperature 1, meaning systems which exclude the requirement of cooperative
binding by tiles (i.e., the requirement that a tile must be able to bind to at
least 2 tiles in an existing assembly if it is to attach). Cooperative binding
is conjectured to be required in the standard aTAM for Turing universal
computation and the efficient self-assembly of shapes, but we show that in the
DaTAM these behaviors can in fact be exhibited at temperature 1. We then show
that the DaTAM doesn't provide asymptotic improvements over the aTAM in its
ability to efficiently build thin rectangles. Finally, we present a series of
results which prove that the temperature-2 aTAM and temperature-1 DaTAM have
mutually exclusive powers. That is, each is able to self-assemble shapes that
the other can't, and each has systems which cannot be simulated by the other.
Beyond being of purely theoretical interest, these results have practical
motivation as duples have already proven to be useful in laboratory
implementations of DNA-based tiles."
"The development of long-term data storage technology is one of the urging
problems of our time. This paper presents the results of implementation of
technical solution for long-term data storage technology proposed a few years
ago on the basis of single crystal sapphire. It is shown that the problem of
reading data through a substrate of negative single crystal sapphire can be
solved by using for reading a special optical system with a plate of positive
single crystal quartz. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the
proposed method of compensation."
"In the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), the phenomenon of cooperation
occurs when the attachment of a new tile to a growing assembly requires it to
bind to more than one tile already in the assembly. Often referred to as
``temperature-2'' systems, those which employ cooperation are known to be quite
powerful (i.e. they are computationally universal and can build an enormous
variety of shapes and structures). Conversely, aTAM systems which do not
enforce cooperative behavior, a.k.a. ``temperature-1'' systems, are conjectured
to be relatively very weak, likely to be unable to perform complex computations
or algorithmically direct the process of self-assembly. Nonetheless, a variety
of models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in
which temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation
through a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several
of those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate
the stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems.
  In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1
systems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM)
in which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is
also unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2
aTAM. We then show that by combining the properties of two such models, the
Dupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a
model which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at
temperature-2. Specifically, the DrgTAM, at temperature-1, can simulate any
aTAM system of any temperature, and it also contains systems which cannot be
simulated by any system in the aTAM."
"We study the computational complexity of the recently proposed nubot model of
molecular-scale self-assembly. The model generalises asynchronous cellular
automata to have non-local movement where large assemblies of molecules can be
pushed and pulled around, analogous to millions of molecular motors in animal
muscle effecting the rapid movement of macroscale arms and legs. We show that
the nubot model is capable of simulating Boolean circuits of polylogarithmic
depth and polynomial size, in only polylogarithmic expected time. In
computational complexity terms, we show that any problem from the complexity
class NC is solvable in polylogarithmic expected time and polynomial workspace
using nubots.
  Along the way, we give fast parallel nubot algorithms for a number of
problems including line growth, sorting, Boolean matrix multiplication and
space-bounded Turing machine simulation, all using a constant number of nubot
states (monomer types). Circuit depth is a well-studied notion of parallel
time, and our result implies that the nubot model is a highly parallel model of
computation in a formal sense. Asynchronous cellular automata are not capable
of this parallelism, and our result shows that adding a rigid-body movement
primitive to such a model, to get the nubot model, drastically increases
parallel processing abilities."
"Since their inception at {\it Macy conferences} in later 1940s complex
systems remain the most controversial topic of inter-disciplinary sciences. The
term `complex system' is the most vague and liberally used scientific term.
Using elementary cellular automata (ECA), and exploiting the CA classification,
we demonstrate elusiveness of `complexity' by shifting space-time dynamics of
the automata from simple to complex by enriching cells with {\it memory}. This
way, we can transform any ECA class to another ECA class --- without changing
skeleton of cell-state transition function --- and vice versa by just selecting
a right kind of memory. A systematic analysis display that memory helps
`discover' hidden information and behaviour on trivial --- uniform, periodic,
and non-trivial --- chaotic, complex --- dynamical systems."
"In this modern era a great deal of metamorphism is observed around us which
eventuate due to some minute modifications and innovations in the area of
Science and Technology. This paper deals with the application of a meta
heuristic optimization algorithm namely the Cuckoo Search Algorithm in the
design of an optimized planar antenna array which ensures high
gain,directivity, suppression of side lobes, increased efficiency and improves
other antenna parameters as well."
"As the conventional silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor
(MOSFET) approaches its scaling limits; many novel device structures are being
extensively explored. Among them, the silicon nanowire transistor (SNWT) has
attracted broad attention. To understand device physics in depth and to assess
the performance limits of SNWTs, simulation is becoming increasingly important.
The objectives of this work are: 1) to theoretically explore the essential
physics of SNWTs (e.g., electrostatics, transport and band structure) by
performing computer-based simulations, and 2) to assess the performance limits
and scaling potentials of SNWTs and to address the SNWT design issues. The
computer based simulations carried out are essentially based on DFT using NEGF
formalism. A silicon nanowire has been modeled as PN diode (Zener Diode), PIN
diode, PIP & NIN diode configurations by selectively doping the nanowire and
simulated by biasing one end of the nanowire to ground and sweeping the other
end of the nanowire from -1 V to 1 V to obtain the electrical characteristics
of the respective diodes. In order to determine the effectiveness of the
modeled diodes in silicon nanowire, the same diodes have been modeled using a
germanium nanowire by selective doping and simulated in the same manner to
obtain the electrical characteristics of the germanium nanowire based diodes
which has been used as a reference to analyze the characteristics obtained
using silicon nanowire. The modeled diodes are extremely small in dimension
when compared to the conventional bulk silicon and germanium based diodes. This
work is followed by modeling and simulation of a gate all around nanowire field
effect transistor using two different gate dielectrics, followed by temperature
dependence of the nanowire FET characteristics and the off state current and
conductance variation using the two dielectrics."
"The marriage of two vibrant fields---photonics and neuromorphic
processing---is fundamentally enabled by the strong analogies within the
underlying physics between the dynamics of biological neurons and lasers, both
of which can be understood within the framework of nonlinear dynamical systems
theory. Whereas neuromorphic engineering exploits the biophysics of neuronal
computation algorithms to provide a wide range of computing and signal
processing applications, photonics offer an alternative approach to
neuromorphic systems by exploiting the high speed, high bandwidth, and low
crosstalk available to photonic interconnects which potentially grants the
capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making. Here we
highlight some recent progress on this exciting field."
"Discrete time quantum walks are known to be universal for quantum
computation. This has been proven by showing that they can simulate a universal
quantum gate set. In this paper, we examine computation by quantum walks in
terms of language acceptance, and present two ways in which discrete time
quantum walks can accept some languages with certainty. These walks can take
quantum as well as classical inputs, and we show that when the input is
quantum, the walks can also be interpreted as performing the task of quantum
state discrimination."
"In this letter, we present an implementation of a neural microcircuit for
image processing employing Hebbian-adaptive learning. The neuronal circuit
utilizes only excitatory synapses to correlate action potentials, extracting
the uncorrelated ones, which contain significant image information. This
circuit is capable of approximating Gabor-like image filtering and other image
processing functions"
"We explore the relation between memcomputing, namely computing with and in
memory, and swarm intelligence algorithms. In particular, we show that one can
design memristive networks to solve short-path optimization problems that can
also be solved by ant-colony algorithms. By employing appropriate memristive
elements one can demonstrate an almost one-to-one correspondence between
memcomputing and ant colony optimization approaches. However, the memristive
network has the capability of finding the solution in one deterministic step,
compared to the stochastic multi-step ant colony optimization. This result
paves the way for nanoscale hardware implementations of several swarm
intelligence algorithms that are presently explored, from scheduling problems
to robotics."
"The design of biologically-inspired wireless communication systems using
bacteria as the basic element of the system is initially motivated by a
phenomenon called \emph{Quorum Sensing}. Due to high randomness in the
individual behavior of a bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria
is almost impossible. Therefore, we have recently proposed that a population of
bacteria in a cluster is considered as a bio node in the network capable of
molecular transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a
reliable bio node out of many unreliable bacteria.
  In this paper, we study the communication between two nodes in such a network
where information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the
transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter node
propagate through the diffusion channel. Then, the concentration of molecules
is sensed by the bacteria population in the receiver node which would decode
the information and output light or fluorescent as a result. The uncertainty in
the communication is caused by all three components of communication, i.e.,
transmission, propagation and reception. We study the theoretical limits of the
information transfer rate in the presence of such uncertainties. Finally, we
consider M-ary signaling schemes and study their achievable rates and
corresponding error probabilities."
"Molecular communication between biological entities is a new paradigm in
communications. Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes
formed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,
we used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such
communication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules
that a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the
number of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls
with distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.
In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a
molecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the
different or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the
transmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the
relay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the
receiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type
of molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of
concentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number
of bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,
we obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that
multi-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the
second scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary
signaling scheme. We show that this relaying strategy increases the reliability
of M-ary communication significantly."
"Real-time detection of moving objects involves memorisation of features in
the template image and their comparison with those in the test image. At high
sampling rates, such techniques face the problems of high algorithmic
complexity and component delays. We present a new resistive switching based
threshold logic cell which encodes the pixels of a template image. The cell
comprises a voltage divider circuit that programs the resistances of the
memristors arranged in a single node threshold logic network and the output is
encoded as a binary value using a CMOS inverter gate. When a test image is
applied to the template-programmed cell, a mismatch in the respective pixels is
seen as a change in the output voltage of the cell. The proposed cell when
compared with CMOS equivalent implementation shows improved performance in
area, leakage power, power dissipation and delay."
"Recent advances bring within reach the viability of solving combinatorial
problems using a quantum annealing algorithm implemented on a purpose-built
platform that exploits quantum properties. However, the question of how to tune
the algorithm for most effective use in this framework is not well understood.
In this paper we describe some operational parameters that drive performance,
discuss approaches for mitigating sources of error, and present experimental
results from a D-Wave Two quantum annealing processor."
"We show theoretically that networks of membrane memcapacitive systems --
capacitors with memory made out of membrane materials -- can be used to perform
a complete set of logic gates in a massively parallel way by simply changing
the external input amplitudes, but not the topology of the network. This
polymorphism is an important characteristic of memcomputing (computing with
memories) that closely reproduces one of the main features of the brain. A
practical realization of these membrane memcapacitive systems, using, e.g.,
graphene or other 2D materials, would be a step forward towards a solid-state
realization of memcomputing with passive devices."
"In the nanonetworking literature, many solutions have been suggested to
enable the nanomachine-to-nanomachine communication. Among these solutions, we
focus on what constitutes the basis for molecular communication paradigms
--molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD). In this paper, we start with an
analytical modeling of a spherical absorbing receiver under messenger molecule
degradation and show that our formulations are in agreement with the simulation
results of a similar topology. Next, we identify how such signal
characteristics as pulse peak time and pulse amplitude are affected by
degradation. Indeed, we show analytically how in MCvD, signal shaping is
achieved through degradation. We also compare communication under messenger
molecule degradation with the case of no-degradation and electromagnetic
communication in terms of channel characteristics. Lastly, we evaluate the
communication performance of the scenarios having various degradation rates.
Here, we assess the system performance according to traditional network metrics
such as the level of inter-symbol interference, detection performance, bit
error rate, and channel capacity. Our results indicate that introducing
degradation significantly improves the system performance when the rate of
degradation is appropriately selected. We make a thorough analysis of the
communication scenario by taking into account different detection thresholds,
symbol durations, and communication distances."
"Molecular communication is a new field of communication where molecules are
used to transfer information. Among the proposed methods, molecular
communication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main
challenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits
communication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy
efficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a
pre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a
decision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the
optimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally
calculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD
system suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,
new modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of
ISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a
modulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is
proposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.
Furthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes
the residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a
new energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute
for the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision
feedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are
compared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more
advantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower
computational complexity."
"Here we focus on the challenge of verifying the correctness of molecular
implementations of abstract chemical reaction networks, where operation in a
well-mixed ""soup"" of molecules is stochastic, asynchronous, concurrent, and
often involves multiple intermediate steps in the implementation, parallel
pathways, and side reactions. This problem relates to the verification of Petri
nets, but existing approaches are not sufficient for providing a single
guarantee covering an infinite set of possible initial states (molecule counts)
and an infinite state space potentially explored by the system given any
initial state. We address these issues by formulating a new theory of pathway
decomposition that provides an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical
reaction network implementations, and we present an algorithm that computes
this basis. Our theory naturally handles certain situations that commonly arise
in molecular implementations, such as what we call ""delayed choice,"" that are
not easily accommodated by other approaches. We further show how pathway
decomposition can be combined with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class
that includes most currently known enzyme-free DNA implementation techniques.
We anticipate that our notion of logical equivalence between chemical reaction
network implementations will be valuable for other molecular implementations
such as biochemical enzyme systems, and perhaps even more broadly in
concurrency theory."
"We prove several limits on the behavior of a model of self-assembling
particles introduced by Dabby and Chen (SODA 2013), called insertion systems,
where monomers insert themselves into the middle of a growing linear polymer.
First, we prove that the expressive power of these systems is equal to
context-free grammars, answering a question posed by Dabby and Chen.
  Second, we give tight bounds on the maximum length and minimum expected time
of constructed polymers in systems of three increasingly restricted classes. We
prove that systems of $k$ monomer types can deterministically construct
polymers of length $n = 2^{\Theta(k^{3/2})}$ in $O(\log^{5/3}(n))$ expected
time. We also prove that if non-deterministic construction of a finite number
of polymers is permitted, then the expected construction time can be reduced to
$O(\log^{3/2}(n))$ at the trade-off of decreasing the length to
$2^{\Theta(k)}$. If the system is allowed to construct an infinite number of
polymers, then constructing polymers of unbounded length in $O(\log{n})$
expected time is possible. We follow these positive results with a set of lower
bounds proving that these are the best possible polymer lengths and expected
construction times."
"Energy Harvesting (EH) has emerged as a promising technique for Green
Communications and it is a novel technique to prolong the lifetime of the
wireless networks with replenishable nodes. In this paper, we consider the
energy shortage analysis of fixed rate transmission in communication systems
with energy harvesting nodes. First, we study the finite-horizon transmission
and provide the general formula for the energy shortage probability. We also
give some examples as benchmarks. Then, we continue to derive a closed-form
expression for infinite-horizon transmission, which is a lower bound for the
energy shortage probability of any finite-horizon transmission. These results
are proposed for both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channels.
Moreover, we show that even under \emph{random energy arrival}, one can
transmit at a fixed rate equal to capacity in the AWGN channels with negligible
aggregate shortage time. We achieve this result using our practical
transmission schemes, proposed for finite-horizon. Also, comprehensive
numerical simulations are performed in AWGN and fading channels with no Channel
State Information (CSI) available at the transmitter, which corroborate our
theoretical findings. Furthermore, we improve the performance of our
transmission schemes in the fading channel with no CSI at the transmitter by
optimizing the transmission initiation threshold."
"Molecular communication in nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm
where molecules are used as information carriers. Concentration Shift Keying
(CSK) and Molecule Shift Keying (MoSK) are being studied extensively for the
short and medium range molecular nanonetworks. It is observed that MoSK
outperforms CSK. However, MoSK requires different types of molecules for
encoding which render transmitter and receiver complexities. We propose a
modulation scheme called On-Off MoSK (OOMoSK) in which, molecules are released
for information bit 1 and no molecule is released for 0. The proposed scheme
enjoys reduced number of the types of molecules for encoding. Numerical results
show that the proposed scheme enhances channel capacity and Symbol Error Rate
(SER)."
"Strongly correlated electron systems such as the rare-earth nickelates
(RNiO3, R = rare-earth element) can exhibit synapse-like continuous long term
potentiation and depression when gated with ionic liquids; exploiting the
extreme sensitivity of coupled charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of
freedom to stoichiometry. We present experimental real-time, device-level
classical conditioning and unlearning using nickelate-based synaptic devices in
an electronic circuit compatible with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
We establish a physical model for the device behavior based on electric-field
driven coupled ionic-electronic diffusion that can be utilized for design of
more complex systems. We use the model to simulate a variety of associate and
non-associative learning mechanisms, as well as a feedforward recurrent network
for storing memory. Our circuit intuitively parallels biological neural
architectures, and it can be readily generalized to other forms of cellular
learning and extinction. The simulation of neural function with electronic
device analogues may provide insight into biological processes such as decision
making, learning and adaptation, while facilitating advanced parallel
information processing in hardware."
"The performance of molecular communication is significantly impacted by the
reception process of the messenger molecules. The receptors' size and density,
however, have yet to be investigated. In this letter, we analyze the effect of
receptor density and size on the signal reception of an absorbing receiver with
receptors. The results show that, when the total receptor area is the same,
better hitting probability is achieved by using a higher number of relatively
small receptors. In addition, deploying receptors, which cover a small
percentage of the receiver surface, is able to create an effective
communication channel that has a detectable signal level."
"Despite the rich literature on quantum algorithms, there is a surprisingly
small amount of coverage of their concrete logical design and implementation.
Most resource estimation is done at the level of complexity analysis, but
actual concrete numbers (of quantum gates, qubits, etc.) can differ by orders
of magnitude. The line of work we present here is a formal framework to write,
and reason about, quantum algorithms. Specifically, we designed a language,
Quipper, with scalability in mind, and we are able to report actual resource
counts for seven non-trivial algorithms found in the quantum computer science
literature."
"Recently, hybrid models have emerged that combine microscopic and mesoscopic
regimes in a single stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation. Microscopic
simulations track every individual molecule and are generally more accurate.
Mesoscopic simulations partition the environment into subvolumes, track when
molecules move between adjacent subvolumes, and are generally more
computationally efficient. In this paper, we present the foundation of a
multi-scale stochastic simulator from the perspective of molecular
communication, for both mesoscopic and hybrid models, where we emphasize
simulation accuracy at the receiver and efficiency in regions that are far from
the communication link. Our multi-scale models use subvolumes of different
sizes, between which we derive the diffusion event transition rate. Simulation
results compare the accuracy and efficiency of traditional approaches with that
of a regular hybrid method and with those of our proposed multi-scale methods."
"Artifact metrics is an information security technology that uses the
intrinsic characteristics of a physical object for authentication and clone
resistance. Here, we demonstrate nano-artifact metrics based on silicon
nanostructures formed via an array of resist pillars that randomly collapse
when exposed to electron-beam lithography. The proposed technique uses
conventional and scalable lithography processes, and because of the random
collapse of resist, the resultant structure has extremely fine-scale morphology
with a minimum dimension below 10 nm, which is less than the resolution of
current lithography capabilities. By evaluating false match, false non-match
and clone-resistance rates, we clarify that the nanostructured patterns based
on resist collapse satisfy the requirements for high-performance security
applications."
"Communication at mmWave frequencies has been the focus in the recent years.
In this paper, we discuss standardization efforts in 60 GHz short range
communication and the progress therein. We compare the available standards in
terms of network architecture, medium access control mechanisms, physical layer
techniques and several other features. Comparative analysis indicates that IEEE
802.11ad is likely to lead the short-range indoor communication at 60 GHz. We
bring to the fore resolved and unresolved issues pertaining to robust WLAN
connectivity at 60 GHz. Further, we discuss the role of mmWave bands in 5G
communication scenarios and highlight the further efforts required in terms of
research and standardization."
"This paper presents a compact programmable biphasic stimulator for cochlear
implants. By employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of
the current generator is increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of
the output transistor. To make the stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation
current is set by scaling a reference current using a two stage binary-weighted
transistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a 4 bit
low-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the
area of the circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented
in AMS 0.18um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of
about 0.042mm^2. Measurement results show that proper charge balance of the
anodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor
can be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the proposed
system suitable for a large number of channels."
"We investigate the subclass of reversible functions that are self-inverse and
relate them to reversible circuits that are equal to their reverse circuit,
which are called palindromic circuits. We precisely determine which
self-inverse functions can be realized as a palindromic circuit. For those
functions that cannot be realized as a palindromic circuit, we find alternative
palindromic representations that require an extra circuit line or quantum gates
in their construction. Our analyses make use of involutions in the symmetric
group $S_{2^n}$ which are isomorphic to self-inverse reversible function on $n$
variables."
"A concept for a novel CMOS image sensor suited for analog image
pre-processing is presented in this paper. As an example, an image restoration
algorithm for reducing image noise is applied as image pre-processing in the
analog domain. To supply low-latency data input for analog image preprocessing,
the proposed concept for a CMOS image sensor offers a new sensor signal
acquisition method in 2D. In comparison to image pre-processing in the digital
domain, the proposed analog image pre-processing promises an improved image
quality. Furthermore, the image noise at the stage of analog sensor signal
acquisition can be used to select the most effective restoration algorithm
applied to the analog circuit due to image processing prior to the A/D
converter."
"The original Pascaline was a mechanical calculator able to sum and subtract
integers. It encodes information in the angles of mechanical wheels and through
a set of gears, and aided by gravity, could perform the calculations. Here, we
show that such a concept can be realized in electronics using memory elements
such as memristive systems. By using memristive emulators we have demonstrated
experimentally the memcomputing version of the mechanical Pascaline, capable of
processing and storing the numerical results in the multiple levels of each
memristive element. Our result is the first experimental demonstration of
multidigit arithmetics with multi-level memory devices that further emphasizes
the versatility and potential of memristive systems for future
massively-parallel high-density computing architectures."
"The main limitation of visible light communication (VLC) is the narrow
modulation bandwidth, which reduces the achievable data rates. In this paper,
we apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to enhance the
achievable throughput in high-rate VLC downlink networks. We first propose a
novel gain ratio power allocation (GRPA) strategy that takes into account the
users' channel conditions to ensure efficient and fair power allocation. Our
results indicate that GRPA significantly enhances system performance compared
to the static power allocation. We also study the effect of tuning the
transmission angles of the light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the field of views
(FOVs) of the receivers, and demonstrate that these parameters can offer new
degrees of freedom to boost NOMA performance. Simulation results reveal that
NOMA is a promising multiple access scheme for the downlink of VLC networks."
"Advances in materials science have led to physical instantiations of
self-assembled networks of memristive devices and demonstrations of their
computational capability through reservoir computing. Reservoir computing is an
approach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time
computing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a
time-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a
desired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the
computational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated
readouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of
interconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal
amplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which
improves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number
of output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small
networks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform
generation tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor
of 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single
memristive networks are unable to produce the correct result. Hierarchical
composition is key for solving more complex tasks with such novel nano-scale
hardware."
"Pervasive systems refers to context-aware systems that can sense their
context, and adapt their behavior accordingly to provide adaptable services.
Proactive adaptation of such systems allows changing the service and the
context based on prediction. However, the definition of the context is still
vague and not suitable to prediction. In this paper we discuss and classify
previous definitions of context. Then, we present a new definition which allows
pervasive systems to understand and predict their contexts. We analyze the
essential lines that fall within the context definition, and propose some
scenarios to make it clear our approach."
"DNA strand displacement systems have proven themselves to be fertile
substrates for the design of programmable molecular machinery and circuitry.
Domain-level reaction enumerators provide the foundations for molecular
programming languages by formalizing DNA strand displacement mechanisms and
modeling interactions at the ""domain"" level - one level of abstraction above
models that explicitly describe DNA strand sequences. Unfortunately, the
most-developed models currently only treat pseudo-linear DNA structures, while
many systems being experimentally and theoretically pursued exploit a much
broader range of secondary structure configurations. Here, we describe a new
domain-level reaction enumerator that can handle arbitrary non-pseudoknotted
secondary structures and reaction mechanisms including association and
dissociation, 3-way and 4-way branch migration, and direct as well as remote
toehold activation. To avoid polymerization that is inherent when considering
general structures, we employ a time-scale separation technique that holds in
the limit of low concentrations. This also allows us to ""condense"" the detailed
reactions by eliminating fast transients, with provable guarantees of
correctness for the set of reactions and their kinetics. We hope that the new
reaction enumerator will be used in new molecular programming languages,
compilers, and tools for analysis and verification that treat a wider variety
of mechanisms of interest to experimental and theoretical work. We have
implemented this enumerator in Python, and it is included in the DyNAMiC
Workbench Integrated Development Environment."
"In this paper we present a uniform method for translating an arbitrary
nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) into a deterministic mass action
biochemical reaction network (BRN) that simulates it. The BRN receives its
input as a continuous time signal consisting of concentrations of chemical
species that vary to represent the NFA's input string in a natural way. The BRN
exploits the inherent parallelism of chemical kinetics to simulate the NFA in
real time with a number of chemical species that is linear in the number of
states of the NFA. We prove that the simulation is correct and that it is
robust with respect to perturbations of the input signal, the initial
concentrations of species, the output (decision), and the rate constants of the
reactions of the BRN."
"Digital data explosion drives a demand for robust and reliable data storage
medium. Development of better digital storage device to accumulate Zetta bytes
(1 ZB = $10^{21}$ bytes ) of data that will be generated in near future is a
big challenge. Looking at limitations of present day digital storage devices,
it will soon be a big challenge for data scientists to provide reliable.
affordable and dense storage medium. As an alternative, researcher used natural
medium of storage like DNA, bacteria and protein as information storage
systems. This article discuss DNA based information storage system in detail
along with an overview about bacterial and protein data storage systems."
"A neuromorphic chip that combines CMOS analog spiking neurons and memristive
synapses offers a promising solution to brain-inspired computing, as it can
provide massive neural network parallelism and density. Previous hybrid analog
CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and
thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of
memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and
post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe
a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses
to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines
integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements
competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ
plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits
recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit
simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it
realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient
brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive
computing."
"We describe a visual programming language for defining behaviors manifested
by reified actors in a 2D virtual world that can be compiled into programs
comprised of sequences of combinators that are themselves reified as actors.
This makes it possible to build programs that build programs from components of
a few fixed types delivered by diffusion using processes that resemble
chemistry as much as computation."
"Diffusion-based and neural communication are two interesting domains in
molecular communication. Both of them have distinct advantages and are
exploited separately in many works. However, in some cases, neural and
diffusion-based ways have to work together for a communication. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a hybrid communication system, in which the
diffusion-based and neural communication channels are contained. Multiple
connection nano-devices (CND) are used to connect the two channels. We define
the practice function of the CNDs and develop the mechanism of exchanging
information from diffusion-based to neural channel, based on the biological
characteristics of the both channels. In addition, we establish a brief
mathematical model to present the complete communication process of the hybrid
system. The information exchange process at the CNDs is shown in the
simulation. The bit error rate (BER) indicator is used to verify the
reliability of communication. The result reveals that based on the biological
channels, optimizing some parameters of nano-devices could improve the
reliability performance."
"We provide an overview of current approaches to DNA-based storage system
design and accompanying synthesis, sequencing and editing methods. We also
introduce and analyze a suite of new constrained coding schemes for both
archival and random access DNA storage channels. The mathematical basis of our
work is the construction and design of sequences over discrete alphabets that
avoid pre-specified address patterns, have balanced base content, and exhibit
other relevant substring constraints. These schemes adapt the stored signals to
the DNA medium and thereby reduce the inherent error-rate of the system."
"In this paper we propose a wet lab algorithm for prediction of radiation fog
by DNA computing. The concept of DNA computing is essentially exploited for
generating the classifier algorithm in the wet lab. The classifier is based on
a new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning suitable for wet lab
implementation. This new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning is
different from conventional approach to fuzzy reasoning based on similarity
measure and also replaces the logical aspect of classical fuzzy reasoning by
DNA chemistry. Thus, we add a new dimension to existing forms of fuzzy
reasoning by bringing it down to nanoscale. We exploit the concept of massive
parallelism of DNA computing by designing this new classifier in the wet lab.
This newly designed classifier is very much generalized in nature and apart
from prediction of radiation fog this methodology can be applied to other types
of data also. To achieve our goal we first fuzzify the given observed
parameters in a form of synthetic DNA sequence which is called fuzzy DNA and
which handles the vague concept of human reasoning."
"A quantum annealer heuristically minimizes quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) problems, but is limited by the physical hardware in the
size and density of the problems it can handle. We have developed a
meta-heuristic solver that utilizes D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer (or any
other QUBO problem optimizer) to solve larger or denser problems, by
iteratively solving subproblems, while keeping the rest of the variables fixed.
We present our algorithm, several variants, and the results for the
optimization of standard QUBO problem instances from OR-Library of sizes 500
and 2500 as well as the Palubeckis instances of sizes 3000 to 7000. For
practical use of the solver, we show the dependence of the time to best
solution on the desired gap to the best known solution. In addition, we study
the dependence of the gap and the time to best solution on the size of the
problems solved by the underlying optimizer."
"This paper extends the notion of information processing capacity for
non-independent input signals in the context of reservoir computing (RC). The
presence of input autocorrelation makes worthwhile the treatment of forecasting
and filtering problems for which we explicitly compute this generalized
capacity as a function of the reservoir parameter values using a streamlined
model. The reservoir model leading to these developments is used to show that,
whenever that approximation is valid, this computational paradigm satisfies the
so called separation and fading memory properties that are usually associated
with good information processing performances. We show that several standard
memory, forecasting, and filtering problems that appear in the parametric
stochastic time series context can be readily formulated and tackled via RC
which, as we show, significantly outperforms standard techniques in some
instances."
"We introduce and study the computational power of Oritatami, a theoretical
model to explore greedy molecular folding, by which the molecule begins to fold
before waiting the end of its production. This model is inspired by our recent
experimental work demonstrating the construction of shapes at the nanoscale by
folding an RNA molecule during its transcription from an engineered sequence of
synthetic DNA. While predicting the most likely conformation is known to be
NP-complete in other models, Oritatami sequences fold optimally in linear time.
Although our model uses only a small subset of the mechanisms known to be
involved in molecular folding, we show that it is capable of efficient
universal computation, implying that any extension of this model will have this
property as well.
  We introduce general design techniques for programming these molecules. Our
main result in this direction is an algorithm in time linear in the sequence
length, that finds a rule for folding the sequence deterministically into a
prescribed set of shapes depending of its environment. This shows the
corresponding problem is fixed-parameter tractable although we proved it is
NP-complete in the number of possible environments. This algorithm was used
effectively to design several key steps of our constructions."
"In this work, we investigate the communication reliability for
diffusion-based molecular communication, using the indicator of bit error rate
(BER). A molecular classified model is established to divide molecules into
three parts, which are the signal, inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise.
We expand each part separately using molecular absorbing probability, and
connect them by a traditional-like formula. Based on the classified model, we
do a theoretical analysis to prove the feasibility of improving the BER
performance. Accordingly, an adaptive threshold variation (ATV) algorithm is
designed in demodulation to implement the goal, which makes the receiver adapt
the channel condition properly through learning process. Moreover, the
complexity of ATV is calculated and its performance in various noisy channel is
discussed. An expression of Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) is
defined to verify the system performance. We test some important parameters of
the channel model, as well as the ATV algorithm in the simulation section. The
results have shown the performance gain of the proposal."
"The security of the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-(like)-noise (KLJN) key exchange
system is based on the Fluctuation-Dissipation-Theorem of classical statistical
physics. Similarly to quantum key distribution, in practical situations, due to
the non-idealities of the building elements, there is a small information leak,
which can be mitigated by privacy amplification or other techniques so that the
unconditional (information theoretic) security is preserved. In this paper, the
industrial cable and circuit simulator LTSPICE is used to validate the
information leak due to one of the non-idealities in KLJN, the parasitic
(cable) capacitance. Simulation results show that privacy amplification and/or
capacitor killer (capacitance compensation) arrangements can effectively
eliminate the leak."
"There are now several works on the use of the additive inverse Gaussian noise
(AIGN) model for the random transit time in molecular communication~(MC)
channels. The randomness invariably causes inter-symbol interference (ISI) in
MC, an issue largely ignored or simplified. In this paper we derive an upper
bound and two lower bounds for MC based on amplitude shift keying (ASK) in
presence of ISI. The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm~(BAA) is modified to find the
input distribution of transmitted symbols to maximize the lower bounds. Our
results show that over wide parameter values the bounds are close."
"Spatial and temporal variability of HfOx-based resistive random access memory
(RRAM) are investigated for manufacturing and product designs. Manufacturing
variability is characterized at different levels including lots, wafers, and
chips. Bit-error-rate (BER) is proposed as a holistic parameter for the write
cycle resistance statistics. Using the electrical in-line-test cycle data, a
method is developed to derive BERs as functions of the design margin, to
provide guidance for technology evaluation and product design. The proposed BER
calculation can also be used in the off-line bench test and build-in-self-test
(BIST) for adaptive error correction and for the other types of random access
memories."
"We introduce the new concept of ""metalines"" for manipulating the amplitude
and phase profile of an incident wave locally and independently. Thanks to the
highly confined graphene plasmons, a transmit-array of graphene-based metalines
is used to realize analog computing on an ultra-compact, integrable and planar
platform. By employing the general concepts of spatial Fourier transformation,
a well-designed structure of such meta-transmit-array combined with graded
index lenses can perform two mathematical operations; i.e. differentiation and
integration, with high efficiency. The presented configuration is about 60
times shorter than the recent structure proposed by Silva et al.(Science, 2014,
343, 160-163); moreover, our simulated output responses are in more agreement
with the desired analytic results. These findings may lead to remarkable
achievements in light-based plasmonic signal processors at nanoscale instead of
their bulky conventional dielectric lens-based counterparts."
"Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an innovative technology which exploits the
laws of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute unconditionally secure
cryptographic keys. While QKD offers the promise of unconditionally secure key
distribution, real world systems are built from non-ideal components which
necessitates the need to model and understand the impact these non-idealities
have on system performance and security. OMNeT++ has been used as a basis to
develop a simulation framework to support this endeavor. This framework,
referred to as ""qkdX"" extends OMNeT++'s module and message abstractions to
efficiently model optical components, optical pulses, operating protocols and
processes. This paper presents the design of this framework including how
OMNeT++'s abstractions have been utilized to model quantum optical components,
optical pulses, fiber and free space channels. Furthermore, from our toolbox of
created components, we present various notional and real QKD systems, which
have been studied and analyzed."
"Quantum adiabatic evolution is perceived as useful for binary quadratic
programming problems that are a priori unconstrained. For constrained problems,
it is a common practice to relax linear equality constraints as penalty terms
in the objective function. However, there has not yet been proposed a method
for efficiently dealing with inequality constraints using the quantum adiabatic
approach. In this paper, we give a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a
binary quadratic programming (BQP) problem in the presence of inequality
constraints and employ this procedure within a branch-and-bound framework for
constrained BQP (CBQP) problems."
"We give a rigorous framework for the interaction of physical computing
devices with abstract computation. Device and program are mediated by the
non-logical 'representation relation'; we give the conditions under which
representation and device theory give rise to commuting diagrams between
logical and physical domains, and the conditions for computation to occur. We
give the interface of this new framework with currently existing formal
methods, showing in particular its close relationship to refinement theory, and
the implications for questions of meaning and reference in theoretical computer
science. The case of hybrid computing is considered in detail, addressing in
particular the example of an internet-mediated 'social machine', and the
abstraction/representation framework used to provide a formal distinction
between heterotic and hybrid computing. This forms the basis for future use of
the framework in formal treatments of nonstandard physical computers."
"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems are power-limited and susceptible
to blockages. As a result, mmWave connectivity will be likely to be
intermittent. One promising approach to increasing mmWave connectivity and
range is to use relays. Device-to-device (D2D) communications open the door to
the vast opportunities of D2D and device-to-network relaying for mmWave
cellular systems. In this correspondence, we study how to select a good relay
for a given source-destination pair in a two-hop mmWave cellular system, where
the mmWave links are subject to random Bernoulli blockages. In such a system,
probing more relays could potentially lead to the discovery of a better relay
but at the cost of more overhead. We find that the throughput-optimal relay
probing strategy is a pure threshold policy: the system can stop relay probing
once the achievable spectral efficiency of the currently probed two-hop link
exceeds some threshold. In general, the spectral efficiency threshold can be
obtained by solving a fixed point equation. For the special case with on/off
mmWave links, we derive a closed-form solution for the threshold. Numerical
results demonstrate that the threshold-based relay probing strategy can yield
remarkable throughput gains."
"In active transport molecular communication (ATMC), information particles are
actively transported from a transmitter to a receiver using special proteins.
Prior work has demonstrated that ATMC can be an attractive and viable solution
for on-chip applications. The energy consumption of an ATMC system plays a
central role in its design and engineering. In this work, an energy model is
presented for ATMC and the model is used to provide guidelines for designing
energy efficient systems. The channel capacity per unit energy is analyzed and
maximized. It is shown that based on the size of the symbol set and the symbol
duration, there is a vesicle size that maximizes rate per unit energy. It is
also demonstrated that maximizing rate per unit energy yields very different
system parameters compared to maximizing the rate only."
"Memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing
based on the similarity between them and neurons (specifically synapses and ion
pumps). The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a
short-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term
memory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate
the physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of
these current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing
returns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to
implement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential
logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full
Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's
short-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the
carry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also
outputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not
physically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port
with an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to
unexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's
slow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large
computation with such slow operations speeds. We propose that using spiking
logic, either in gates or as neuron-analogues, with plastic rewritable
connections between them, would allow the building of a neuromorphic computer."
"Neuron is the most important building block in our brain, and information
processing in individual neuron involves the transformation of input synaptic
spike trains into an appropriate output spike train. Hardware implementation of
neuron by individual ionic/electronic hybrid device is of great significance
for enhancing our understanding of the brain and solving sensory processing and
complex recognition tasks. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle artificial
neuron based on a proton conducting graphene oxide (GO) coupled oxide-based
electric-double-layer (EDL) transistor with multiple driving inputs and one
modulatory input terminal. Paired-pulse facilitation, dendritic integration and
orientation tuning were successfully emulated. Additionally, neuronal gain
control (arithmetic) in the scheme of rate coding is also experimentally
demonstrated. Our results provide a new-concept approach for building
brain-inspired cognitive systems."
"Random projections have proven extremely useful in many signal processing and
machine learning applications. However, they often require either to store a
very large random matrix, or to use a different, structured matrix to reduce
the computational and memory costs. Here, we overcome this difficulty by
proposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections
literally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory.
This is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering
of coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of
classification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database,
the experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the
corresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for
applications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.
We discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels,
speed, memory consumption and different problems."
"In diffusion-based molecular communication (DMC), one important functionality
of a transmitter nano-machine is signal modulation. In particular, the
transmitter has to be able to control the release of signaling molecules for
modulation of the information bits. An important class of control mechanisms in
natural cells for releasing molecules is based on ion channels which are
pore-forming proteins across the cell membrane whose opening and closing may be
controlled by a gating parameter. In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on
ion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are
released from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal.
Exploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying
modulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal,
i.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is
derived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a
closed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is
obtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released
molecules regardless of this assumption. The derived average modulated signal
is compared to results obtained with a particle based simulator. The numerical
results show that the derived upper bound is tight if the number of ion
channels distributed across the transmitter (cell) membrane is small."
"Living organisms survive and multiply even though they have uncertain and
incomplete information about their environment and imperfect models to predict
the consequences of their actions. Bayesian models have been proposed to face
this challenge. Indeed, Bayesian inference is a way to do optimal reasoning
when only uncertain and incomplete information is available. Various
perceptive, sensory-motor, and cognitive functions have been successfully
modeled this way. However, the biological mechanisms allowing animals and
humans to represent and to compute probability distributions are not known. It
has been proposed that neurons and assemblies of neurons could be the
appropriate scale to search for clues to probabilistic reasoning. In contrast,
in this paper, we propose that interacting populations of macromolecules and
diffusible messengers can perform probabilistic computation. This suggests that
probabilistic reasoning, based on cellular signaling pathways, is a fundamental
skill of living organisms available to the simplest unicellular organisms as
well as the most complex brains."
"Concentration modulation, whereby information is encoded in the concentration
level of chemicals, is considered. One of the main challenges with such systems
is the limited control the transmitter has on the concentration level at the
receiver. For example, concentration cannot be directly decreased by the
transmitter, and the decrease in concentration over time occurs solely due to
transport mechanisms such as diffusion. This can result in inter-symbol
interference (ISI), which can have degrading effects on performance. In this
work, a new and novel scheme is proposed that uses the transmission of acids,
bases, and the concentration of hydrogen ions for carrying information. By
employing this technique, the concentration of hydrogen ions at the receiver
can be both increased and decreased through the sender's transmissions. This
enables novel ISI mitigation schemes as well as the possibility to form a wider
array of signal patterns at the receiver."
"We introduce a family of quantum walks on cycles parametrized by their
liveliness, defined by the ability to execute a long-range move. We investigate
the behaviour of the probability distribution and time-averaged probability
distribution. We show that the liveliness parameter, controlling the magnitude
of the additional long-range move, has a direct impact on the periodicity of
the limiting distribution. We also show that the introduced model provides a
method for network exploration which is robust against trapping."
"Many networks used in machine learning and as models of biological neural
networks make use of stochastic neurons or neuron-like units. We show that
stochastic artificial neurons can be realized on silicon chips by exploiting
the quasi-periodic behavior of mismatched analog oscillators to approximate the
neuron's stochastic activation function. We represent neurons by finite state
machines (FSMs) that communicate using digital events and whose transitions are
event-triggered. The event generation times of each neuron are controlled by an
analog oscillator internal to that neuron/FSM and the frequencies of the
oscillators in different FSMs are incommensurable. We show that within this
quasi-periodic system, the transition graph of a FSM can be interpreted as the
transition graph of a Markov chain and we show that by using different FSMs, we
can obtain approximations of different stochastic activation functions. We
investigate the quality of the stochastic interpretation of such a
deterministic system and we use the system to realize and sample from a
restricted Boltzmann machine. We implemented the quasi-periodic event-based
system on a custom silicon chip and we show that the chip behavior can be used
to closely approximate a stochastic sampling task."
"The Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) scheme is a statistical/physical
secure key exchange system based on the laws of classical statistical physics
to provide unconditional security. We used the LTSPICE industrial cable and
circuit simulator to emulate one of the major active (invasive) attacks, the
current injection attack, against the ideal and a practical KLJN system,
respectively. We show that two security enhancement techniques, namely, the
instantaneous voltage/current comparison method, and a simple privacy
amplification scheme, independently and effectively eliminate the information
leak and successfully preserve the system's unconditional security."
"We present quantum circuits to implement an exhaustive key search for the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and analyze the quantum resources required
to carry out such an attack. We consider the overall circuit size, the number
of qubits, and the circuit depth as measures for the cost of the presented
quantum algorithms. Throughout, we focus on Clifford$+T$ gates as the
underlying fault-tolerant logical quantum gate set. In particular, for all
three variants of AES (key size 128, 192, and 256 bit) that are standardized in
FIPS-PUB 197, we establish precise bounds for the number of qubits and the
number of elementary logical quantum gates that are needed to implement
Grover's quantum algorithm to extract the key from a small number of AES
plaintext-ciphertext pairs."
"We introduce a class of digital machines we name Digital Memcomputing
Machines (DMMs) able to solve a wide range of problems including
Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP) ones with polynomial resources (in time,
space and energy). An abstract DMM with this power must satisfy a set of
compatible mathematical constraints underlying its practical realization. We
initially prove this by introducing the complexity classes for these machines.
We then make a connection with dynamical systems theory. This leads to the set
of physical constraints for poly-resource resolvability. Once the mathematical
requirements have been assessed, we propose a practical scheme to solve the
above class of problems based on the novel concept of self-organizing logic
gates and circuits (SOLCs). These are logic gates and circuits able to accept
input signals from any terminal, without distinction between conventional input
and output terminals. They can solve boolean problems by self-organizing into
their solution. They can be fabricated either with circuit elements with memory
(such as memristors) and/or standard MOS technology. Using tools of functional
analysis, we prove mathematically the following constraints for the
poly-resource resolvability: i) SOLCs possess a global attractor; ii) their
only equilibrium points are the solutions of the problems to solve; iii) the
system converges exponentially fast to the solutions; iv) the equilibrium
convergence rate scales at most polynomially with input size. We finally
provide arguments that periodic orbits and strange attractors cannot coexist
with equilibria. As examples we show how to solve the prime factorization and
the NP-hard version of the subset-sum problem. Since DMMs map integers into
integers they are robust against noise, and hence scalable. We finally discuss
the implications of the DMM realization through SOLCs to the NP=P question
related to..."
"Quantum networks must classically exchange complex metadata between devices
in order to carry out information for protocols such as teleportation,
super-dense coding, and quantum key distribution. Demonstrating the integration
of these new communication methods with existing network protocols, channels,
and data forwarding mechanisms remains an open challenge. Software-defined
networking (SDN) offers robust and flexible strategies for managing diverse
network devices and uses. We adapt the principles of SDN to the deployment of
quantum networks, which are composed from unique devices that operate according
to the laws of quantum mechanics. We show how quantum metadata can be managed
within a software-defined network using the OpenFlow protocol, and we describe
how OpenFlow management of classical optical channels is compatible with
emerging quantum communication protocols. We next give an example specification
of the metadata needed to manage and control QPHY behavior and we extend the
OpenFlow interface to accommodate this quantum metadata. We conclude by
discussing near-term experimental efforts that can realize SDN's principles for
quantum communication."
"In this paper, we present an analytical model for the diffusive molecular
communication (MC) system with a reversible adsorption receiver in a fluid
environment. The widely used concentration shift keying (CSK) is considered for
modulation. The time-varying spatial distribution of the information molecules
under the reversible adsorption and desorption reaction at the surface of a
receiver is analytically characterized. Based on the spatial distribution, we
derive the net number of newly-adsorbed information molecules expected in any
time duration. We further derive the number of newly-adsorbed molecules
expected at the steady state to demonstrate the equilibrium concentration.
Given the number of newly-adsorbed information molecules, the bit error
probability of the proposed MC system is analytically approximated.
Importantly, we present a simulation framework for the proposed model that
accounts for the diffusion and reversible reaction. Simulation results show the
accuracy of our derived expressions, and demonstrate the positive effect of the
adsorption rate and the negative effect of the desorption rate on the error
probability of reversible adsorption receiver with last transmit bit-1.
Moreover, our analytical results simplify to the special cases of a full
adsorption receiver and a partial adsorption receiver, both of which do not
include desorption."
"Neuromemristive systems (NMSs) currently represent the most promising
platform to achieve energy efficient neuro-inspired computation. However, since
the research field is less than a decade old, there are still countless
algorithms and design paradigms to be explored within these systems. One
particular domain that remains to be fully investigated within NMSs is
unsupervised learning. In this work, we explore the design of an NMS for
unsupervised clustering, which is a critical element of several machine
learning algorithms. Using a simple memristor crossbar architecture and
learning rule, we are able to achieve performance which is on par with MATLAB's
k-means clustering."
"An important challenge in design of modulation schemes for molecular
communication is positivity of the transmission signal (only a positive
concentration of molecules can be released in the environment). This
restriction makes handling of the InterSymbol Interference (ISI) a challenge
for molecular communication. Previous works have proposed use of chemical
reactions to remove molecules from the environment, and to effectively simulate
negative signals. However, the differential equation describing a
diffusion-reaction process is non-linear. This precludes the possibility of
using Fourier transform tools. In this paper, a solution for simulating
negative signals based on the diffusion-reaction channel model is proposed.
While the proposed solution does not exploit the full degrees of freedom
available for signaling in a diffusion-reaction process, but its end-to-end
system is a linear channel and amenable to Fourier transform analysis. Based on
our solution, a modulation scheme and a precoder are introduced and shown to
have a significant reduction in error probability compared to previous
modulation schemes such as CSK and MCSK. The effect of various imperfections
(such as quantization error) on the communication system performance are
studied."
"This paper considers the problem of maximizing the sum-rate for simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a full-duplex bi-directional
communication system subject to energy harvesting and transmit power
constraints at both nodes. We investigate the optimum design of the receive
power splitters and transmit powers for SWIPT in full-duplex mode. Exploiting
rate-split method, an iterative algorithm is derived to solve the non-convex
problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is justified through
numerical simulations."
"In his 2003 paper ""Towards an algebraic theory of Boolean circuits"", Lafont
notes that the class of reversible circuits over a set of k truth values is
finitely generated when k is odd. He cites a private communication for the
proof. The purpose of this short note is to make the content of that
communication available."
"We show that some natural output conventions for error-free computation in
chemical reaction networks (CRN) lead to a common level of computational
expressivity. Our main results are that the standard consensus-based output
convention have equivalent computational power to (1) existence-based and (2)
democracy-based output conventions. The CRNs using the former output convention
have only ""yes"" voters, with the interpretation that the CRN's output is yes if
any voters are present and no otherwise. The CRNs using the latter output
convention define output by majority vote among ""yes"" and ""no"" voters.
  Both results are proven via a generalized framework that simultaneously
captures several definitions, directly inspired by a Petri net result of
Esparza, Ganty, Leroux, and Majumder [CONCUR 2015]. These results support the
thesis that the computational expressivity of error-free CRNs is intrinsic, not
sensitive to arbitrary definitional choices."
"Molecular communication is an emerging paradigm for systems that rely on the
release of molecules as information carriers. Communication via molecular
diffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over
distances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of
the diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter
is a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for
spherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived
channel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment
and can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment.
The point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy
can be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse
responses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA
when the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to
the size of the transmitter. The derived results are verified via microscopic
particle-based simulations using the molecular communication simulation
platform AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion). A spherical
transmitter variation where molecules are released from the surface of a solid
sphere is also considered via simulation."
"This work explores the feasibility of specialized hardware implementing the
Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) in order to fully exploit its inherent
advantages. This algorithm, which is inspired in the current understanding of
the mammalian neo-cortex, is the basis of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory
(HTM). In contrast to other machine learning (ML) approaches, the structure is
not application dependent and relies on fully unsupervised continuous learning.
We hypothesize that a hardware implementation will be able not only to extend
the already practical uses of these ideas to broader scenarios but also to
exploit the hardware-friendly CLA characteristics. The architecture proposed
will enable an unfeasible scalability for software solutions and will fully
capitalize on one of the many CLA advantages: low computational requirements
and reduced storage utilization. Compared to a state-of-the-art CLA software
implementation it could be possible to improve by 4 orders of magnitude in
performance and up to 8 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency. We propose to
use a packet-switched network to tackle this. The paper addresses the
fundamental issues of such an approach, proposing solutions to achieve scalable
solutions. We will analyze cost and performance when using well-known
architecture techniques and tools. The results obtained suggest that even with
CMOS technology, under constrained cost, it might be possible to implement a
large-scale system. We found that the proposed solutions enable a saving of 90%
of the original communication costs running either synthetic or realistic
workloads."
"This work introduces capacity limits for molecular timing (MT) channels,
where information is modulated on the release timing of small information
particles, and decoded from the time of arrival at the receiver. It is shown
that the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise
channel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel, this noise is
distributed according to the L\'evy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the
capacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay
associated with the propagation of information particles in the channel is
finite. These bounds are also shown to be tight."
"An earlier work [18] proposes a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a
constrained binary quadratic programming problem via quantum adiabatic
evolution using an outer approximation method. This should be an efficient
prescription for solving the Lagrangian dual problem in the presence of an
ideally noise-free quantum adiabatic system. However, current implementations
of quantum annealing systems demand methods that are efficient at handling
possible sources of noise. In this paper, we consider a subgradient method for
finding an optimal primal-dual pair for the Lagrangian dual of a constrained
binary polynomial programming problem. We then study the quadratic stable set
(QSS) problem as a case study. We see that this method applied to the QSS
problem can be viewed as an instance-dependent penalty-term approach that
avoids large penalty coefficients. Finally, we report our experimental results
of using the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer and conclude that our approach helps
this quantum processor to succeed more often in solving these problems compared
to the usual penalty-term approaches."
"The performance of communication systems is fundamentally limited by the loss
of energy through propagation and circuit inefficiencies. In this article, we
show that it is possible to achieve ultra low energy communications at the
nano-scale, if diffusive molecules are used for carrying data. Whilst the
energy of electromagnetic waves will inevitably decay as a function of
transmission distance and time, the energy in individual molecules does not.
Over time, the receiver has an opportunity to recover some, if not all of the
molecular energy transmitted. The article demonstrates the potential of
ultra-low energy simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer (SMIET)
through the design of two different nano-relay systems, and the discusses how
molecular communications can benefit more from crowd energy harvesting than
traditional wave-based systems."
"I review the advancements of atomic scale nanoelectronics towards quantum
neuromorphics. First, I summarize the key properties of elementary combinations
of few neurons, namely long-- and short--term plasticity, spike-timing
dependent plasticity (associative plasticity), quantumness and stochastic
effects, and their potential computational employment. Next, I review several
atomic scale device technologies developed to control electron transport at the
atomic level, including single atom implantation for atomic arrays and CMOS
quantum dots, single atom memories, Ag$_2$S and Cu$_2$S atomic switches,
hafnium based RRAMs, organic material based transistors, Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$
synapses. Each material/method proved successful in achieving some of the
properties observed in real neurons. I compare the different methods towards
the creation of a new generation of naturally inspired and biophysically
meaningful artificial neurons, in order to replace the rigid CMOS based
neuromorphic hardware. The most challenging aspect to address appears to obtain
both the stochastic/quantum behavior and the associative plasticity, which are
currently observed only below and above 20 nm length scale respectively, by
employing the same material."
"Optimization of fluid transport in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum has
been the subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature. Existing
models assume that the tube adaptation mechanism in P. polycephalum's tubular
network is controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes. We
put forward the hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the
flow's pressure gradient along the tube. We carry out the stability analysis of
such a revised mathematical model for a parallel-edge network, proving that the
revised model supports the global flow-optimizing behavior of the slime mold
for a substantially wider class of response functions compared to previous
models. Simulations also suggest that the same conclusion may be valid for
arbitrary network topologies."
"We provide a fundamental treatment of the molecular communication channel
wherein ""inscribed matter"" is transmitted across a spatial gap to provide
reliable signaling between a sender and receiver. Inscribed matter is defined
as an ensemble of ""tokens"" (molecules, objects, and so on) and is inspired, at
least partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed
discrete particles ranging from molecules through membrane-bound structures
containing molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and
travel to a target -- for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from
one cell, tissue or organism diffuse to another. For identical tokens that are
neither lost nor modified, we consider messages encoded using three candidate
communication schemes: a) token timing (timed release), b) token payload
(composition), and c) token timing plus payload. We provide capacity bounds for
each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not
unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at
femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or
bin-counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, individual token timing
undergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and
results about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can
inform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in
engineering and biology. This work, Part I, focuses on the information
theoretic bounds on capacity. Part II develops some of the mathematical and
information-theoretic ideas that support the bounds presented here."
"This paper is Part II of a two-paper set which develops a finest-grain
per-molecule timing treatment of molecular communication. We first consider a
simple one-molecule timing channel with a molecule launch deadline, similar to
but different from previous work (""Bits Through Queues"") where the constraint
was mean launch time. We also derive a number of results related to the {\em
ordering entropy}, a key quantity which undergirds the capacity bounds for the
molecular timing channel, both with and without token data payloads. We then
conclude with an upper bound on molecular timing-channel capacity."
"Efficient solutions to NP-complete problems would significantly benefit both
science and industry. However, such problems are intractable on digital
computers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for
alternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic,
continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nature Physics, 7(12),
966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on
even the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost
through exponentially driven auxiliary variables. With some modifications to
the CTDS equations, here we present a novel analog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT,
implementing the CTDS. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a co-processor, and
with its modular design can be readily extended to different problem sizes. The
circuit is designed and simulated based on a 32nm CMOS technology. SPICE
simulation results show speedup factors of $\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest
3-SAT problems, when compared with a state-of-the-art SAT solver on digital
computers. For example, for hard problems with $N=50$ variables and $M=212$
clauses, solutions are found within from a few $ns$ to a few hundred $ns$ with
an average power consumption of ${130}$ $mW$."
"This paper studies the problem of receiver modeling in molecular
communication systems. We consider the diffusive molecular communication
channel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a
fluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter
nano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order
degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can
participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor
proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor
molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected
received signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated
receptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we
consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the
uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only
partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be
accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario
after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy
of the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based
simulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the
effect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results."
"Analyzing the achievable rate of molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD)
inherits intricacies due to its nature: MCvD channel has memory, and the heavy
tail of the signal causes inter symbol interference (ISI). Therefore, using
Shannon's channel capacity formulation for memoryless channel is not
appropriate for the MCvD channel. Instead, a more general achievable rate
formulation and system model must be considered to make this analysis
accurately. In this letter, we propose an effective ISI-aware MCvD modeling
technique in 3-D medium and properly analyze the achievable rate."
"The idea of computing with DNA was given by Tom Head in 1987, however in 1994
in a seminal paper, the actual successful experiment for DNA computing was
performed by Adleman. The heart of the DNA computing is the DNA hybridization,
however, it is also the source of errors. Thus the success of the DNA computing
depends on the error control techniques. The classical coding theory techniques
have provided foundation for the current information and communication
technology (ICT). Thus it is natural to expect that coding theory will be the
foundational subject for the DNA computing paradigm. For the successful
experiments with DNA computing usually we design DNA strings which are
sufficiently dissimilar. This leads to the construction of a large set of DNA
strings which satisfy certain combinatorial and thermodynamic constraints. Over
the last 16 years, many approaches such as combinatorial, algebraic,
computational have been used to construct such DNA strings. In this work, we
survey this interesting area of DNA coding theory by providing key ideas of the
area and current known results."
"Split-execution computing leverages the capabilities of multiple
computational models to solve problems, but splitting program execution across
different computational models incurs costs associated with the translation
between domains. We analyze the performance of a split-execution computing
system developed from conventional and quantum processing units (QPUs) by using
behavioral models that track resource usage. We focus on asymmetric processing
models built using conventional CPUs and a family of special-purpose QPUs that
employ quantum computing principles. Our performance models account for the
translation of a classical optimization problem into the physical
representation required by the quantum processor while also accounting for
hardware limitations and conventional processor speed and memory. We conclude
that the bottleneck in this split-execution computing system lies at the
quantum-classical interface and that the primary time cost is independent of
quantum processor behavior."
"Commodity video-gaming hardware (consoles, graphics cards, tablets, etc.)
performance has been advancing at a rapid pace owing to strong consumer demand
and stiff market competition. Gaming hardware devices are currently amongst the
most powerful and cost-effective computational technologies available in
quantity. In this article, we evaluate a sample of current generation
video-gaming hardware devices for scientific computing and compare their
performance with specialized supercomputing general purpose graphics processing
units (GPGPUs). We use the OpenCL SHOC benchmark suite, which is a measure of
the performance of compute hardware on various different scientific application
kernels, and also a popular public distributed computing application,
Einstein@Home in the field of gravitational physics for the purposes of this
evaluation."
"The theory of computer science is based around Universal Turing Machines
(UTMs): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. Modern
digital computers are physical embodiments of UTMs. The nondeterministic
polynomial (NP) time complexity class of problems is the most significant in
computer science, and an efficient (i.e. polynomial P) way to solve such
problems would be of profound economic and social importance. By definition
nondeterministic UTMs (NUTMs) solve NP complete problems in P time. However,
NUTMs have previously been believed to be physically impossible to construct.
Thue string rewriting systems are computationally equivalent to UTMs, and are
naturally nondeterministic. Here we describe the physical design for a NUTM
that implements a universal Thue system. The design exploits the ability of DNA
to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time.
Each Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel
combination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We
demonstrate that this design works using both computational modelling and in
vitro molecular biology experimentation. The current design has limitations,
such as restricted error-correction. However, it opens up the prospect of
engineering NUTM based computers able to outperform all standard computers on
important practical problems."
"Swarms of robots will revolutionize many industrial applications, from
targeted material delivery to precision farming. However, several of the
heterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future
applications --- robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent
behavior, etc. --- hinder the evolution of the technology from academic
institutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology
originated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer
networks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement
on a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for
a controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed
systems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities
to make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even
profitable. This work explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative
solutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New
security, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for
swarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples.
Finally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the
combination of these two technologies are described."
"Developing devices that can reliably and accurately demonstrate the
principles of superposition and entanglement is an on-going challenge for the
quantum computing community. Modeling and simulation offer attractive means of
testing early device designs and establishing expectations for operational
performance. However, the complex integrated material systems required by
quantum device designs are not captured by any single existing computational
modeling method. We examine the development and analysis of a multi-staged
computational workflow that can be used to design and characterize silicon
donor qubit systems with modeling and simulation. Our approach integrates
quantum computational chemistry calculations with electrostatic field solvers
to perform detailed simulations of a phosphorus dopant in silicon. We show how
atomistic details can be synthesized into an operational model for the logical
gates that define quantum computation in this particular technology. The
resulting computational workflow realizes a design tool for silicon donor
qubits that can help verify and validate current and near-term experimental
devices."
"We introduce an abstract machine architecture for classical/quantum
computations---including compilation---along with a quantum instruction
language called Quil for explicitly writing these computations. With this
formalism, we discuss concrete implementations of the machine and non-trivial
algorithms targeting them. The introduction of this machine dovetails with
ongoing development of quantum computing technology, and makes possible
portable descriptions of recent classical/quantum algorithms."
"Conventional digital computation is rapidly approaching physical limits for
speed and energy dissipation. Here we fabricate and test a simple neuromorphic
circuit that models neuronal somas, axons and synapses with superconducting
Josephson junctions. The circuit models two mutually coupled excitatory
neurons. In some regions of parameter space the neurons are desynchronized. In
others, the Josephson neurons synchronize in one of two states, in-phase or
anti-phase. An experimental alteration of the delay and strength of the
connecting synapses can toggle the system back and forth in a phase-flip
bifurcation. Firing synchronization states are calculated >70,000 times faster
than conventional digital approaches. With their speed and low energy
dissipation (10-17 Joules/spike), this set of proof-of- concept experiments
establishes Josephson junction neurons as a viable approach for improvements in
neuronal computation as well as applications in neuromorphic computing."
"In this paper we review recent work on novel computing paradigms using
coupled oscillatory dynamical systems. We explore systems of relaxation
oscillators based on linear state transitioning devices, which switch between
two discrete states with hysteresis. By harnessing the dynamics of complex,
connected systems we embrace the philosophy of ""let physics do the computing""
and demonstrate how complex phase and frequency dynamics of such systems can be
controlled, programmed and observed to solve computationally hard problems.
Although our discussion in this paper is limited to Insulator-to-Metallic (IMT)
state transition devices, the general philosophy of such computing paradigms
can be translated to other mediums including optical systems. We present the
necessary mathematical treatments necessary to understand the time evolution of
these systems and demonstrate through recent experimental results the potential
of such computational primitives."
"A three-dimensional (3D) Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the design of high
performance and low power many-core chips. Existing 3D NoCs are inadequate for
meeting the ever-increasing performance requirements of many-core processors
since they are simple extensions of regular 2D architectures and they do not
fully exploit the advantages provided by 3D integration. Moreover, the
anticipated performance gain of a 3D NoC-enabled many-core chip may be
compromised due to the potential failures of through-silicon-vias (TSVs) that
are predominantly used as vertical interconnects in a 3D IC. To address these
problems, we propose a machine-learning-inspired predictive design methodology
for energy-efficient and reliable many-core architectures enabled by 3D
integration. We demonstrate that a small-world network-based 3D NoC (3D SWNoC)
performs significantly better than its 3D MESH-based counterparts. On average,
the 3D SWNoC shows 35% energy-delay-product (EDP) improvement over 3D MESH for
the PARSEC and SPLASH2 benchmarks considered in this work. To improve the
reliability of 3D NoC, we propose a computationally efficient spare-vertical
link (sVL) allocation algorithm based on a state-space search formulation. Our
results show that the proposed sVL allocation algorithm can significantly
improve the reliability as well as the lifetime of 3D SWNoC."
"Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for next-generation information
carriers, owing to their small size, topological stability, and ultralow
depinning current density. A wide variety of skyrmionic device concepts and
prototypes have been proposed, highlighting their potential applications. Here,
we report on a bioinspired skyrmionic device with synaptic plasticity. The
synaptic weight of the proposed device can be strengthened/weakened by
positive/negative stimuli, mimicking the potentiation/depression process of a
biological synapse. Both short-term plasticity(STP) and long-term
potentiation(LTP) functionalities have been demonstrated for a spiking
time-dependent plasticity(STDP) scheme. This proposal suggests new
possibilities for synaptic devices for use in spiking neuromorphic computing
applications."
"In a diffusion-based molecular communication system, molecules are employed
to convey information. When propagation and reception processes are considered
in a framework of first passage processes, we need to focus on absorbing
receivers. For this kind of molecular communication system, the characteristics
of the channel is also affected by the shape of the transmitter. In the
literature, most studies focus on systems with a point transmitter due to
circular symmetry. In this letter, we address propagation and reception pattern
for chemical signals emitted from a spherical transmitter. We also investigate
the directivity gain achieved by the reflecting spherical transmitter. We
quantify the power gain by measuring the received power at different angles on
a circular region. Moreover, we define three metrics, i.e., the half-power
pattern-width, the directivity gain, and the peak time of the signal, for
analyzing the received signal pattern."
"While Boolean logic has been the backbone of digital information processing,
there are classes of computationally hard problems wherein this conventional
paradigm is fundamentally inefficient. Vertex coloring of graphs, belonging to
the class of combinatorial optimization represents such a problem; and is well
studied for its wide spectrum of applications in data sciences, life sciences,
social sciences and engineering and technology. This motivates alternate, and
more efficient non-Boolean pathways to their solution. Here, we demonstrate a
coupled relaxation oscillator based dynamical system that exploits the
insulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2), to efficiently solve the
vertex coloring of graphs. By harnessing the natural analogue between
optimization, pertinent to graph coloring solutions, and energy minimization
processes in highly parallel, interconnected dynamical systems, we harness the
physical manifestation of the latter process to approximate the optimal
coloring of k-partite graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection
between the eigen properties of a linear dynamical system and the spectral
algorithms that can solve approximate graph coloring. Our work not only
elucidates a physics-based computing approach but also presents tantalizing
opportunities for building customized analog co-processors for solving hard
problems efficiently."
"This work studies the impact of time- synchronization in molecular timing
(MT) channels by analyzing three different modulation techniques. The first
requires transmitter-receiver synchronization and is based on modulating
information on the release timing of information particles. The other two are
asynchronous and are based on modulating information on the relative time
between two consecutive releases of information particles using
indistinguishable or distinguishable particles. All modulation schemes result
in a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an
additive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of
the variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable
distributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the
geometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this
result to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of
the modulation techniques. In addition, for binary communication, we derive the
optimal detection rules for each modulation technique. Numerical evaluations
indicate that the bit error rate (BER) is constant for a given G-SNR, and the
performance gain obtained by using synchronized communication is significant.
Yet, it is also shown that by using two distinguishable particles per bit
instead of one, the BER of the asynchronous technique can approach that of the
synchronous one."
"Neuromorphic chip refers to an unconventional computing architecture that is
modelled on biological brains. It is ideally suited for processing sensory data
for intelligence computing, decision-making or context cognition. Despite rapid
development, conventional artificial synapses exhibit poor connection
flexibility and require separate data acquisition circuitry, resulting in
limited functionalities and significant hardware redundancy. Here we report a
novel light-stimulated artificial synapse based on a graphene-nanotube hybrid
phototransistor that can directly convert optical stimuli into a ""neural image""
for further neuronal analysis. Our optically-driven synapses involve multiple
steps of plasticity mechanisms and importantly exhibit flexible tuning of both
short- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor
can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division
multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through
charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic
functionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel
neuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics."
"Chern-Simons topological field theories TFTs are the only TFTs that have
already found application in the description of some exotic strongly-correlated
electron systems and the corresponding concept of topological quantum
computing. Here, we show that TFTs of another type, specifically the
gauge-field-less Witten-type TFTs known as topological sigma models, describe
the recently proposed digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) - engineered
dynamical systems with point attractors being the solutions of the
corresponding logic circuit that solves a specific task. This result derives
from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a
topological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a
DMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then
reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time,
associated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by
instantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons
are the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently,
despite their non-quantum character. We exemplify these results with the
solution of prime factorization."
"Efforts at understanding the computational processes in the brain have met
with limited success, despite their importance and potential uses in building
intelligent machines. We propose a simple new model which draws on recent
findings in Neuroscience and the Applied Mathematics of interacting Dynamical
Systems. The Feynman Machine is a Universal Computer for Dynamical Systems,
analogous to the Turing Machine for symbolic computing, but with several
important differences. We demonstrate that networks and hierarchies of simple
interacting Dynamical Systems, each adaptively learning to forecast its
evolution, are capable of automatically building sensorimotor models of the
external and internal world. We identify such networks in mammalian neocortex,
and show how existing theories of cortical computation combine with our model
to explain the power and flexibility of mammalian intelligence. These findings
lead directly to new architectures for machine intelligence. A suite of
software implementations has been built based on these principles, and applied
to a number of spatiotemporal learning tasks."
"Echo-State Networks and Reservoir Computing have been studied for more than a
decade. As they provide an elegant yet powerful alternative to traditional
computing, researchers have tried to implement them using physical systems, in
particular non-linear optical elements, achieving high bandwidth and low power
consumption. Here we present a completely different optical implementation of
Echo-State Networks using light-scattering materials. As a proof of concept,
binary networks have been successfully trained to perform non-linear operations
on time series and memory of such networks has been evaluated. This new method
is fast, power efficient and easily scalable to very large networks."
"A cellular automaton collider is a finite state machine build of rings of
one-dimensional cellular automata. We show how a computation can be performed
on the collider by exploiting interactions between gliders (particles,
localisations). The constructions proposed are based on universality of
elementary cellular automaton rule 110, cyclic tag systems, supercolliders, and
computing on rings."
"Current large scale implementations of deep learning and data mining require
thousands of processors, massive amounts of off-chip memory, and consume
gigajoules of energy. Emerging memory technologies such as nanoscale
two-terminal resistive switching memory devices offer a compact, scalable and
low power alternative that permits on-chip co-located processing and memory in
fine-grain distributed parallel architecture. Here we report first use of
resistive switching memory devices for implementing and training a Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a generative probabilistic graphical model as a key
component for unsupervised learning in deep networks. We experimentally
demonstrate a 45-synapse RBM realized with 90 resistive switching phase change
memory (PCM) elements trained with a bio-inspired variant of the Contrastive
Divergence (CD) algorithm, implementing Hebbian and anti-Hebbian weight
updates. The resistive PCM devices show a two-fold to ten-fold reduction in
error rate in a missing pixel pattern completion task trained over 30 epochs,
compared to untrained case. Measured programming energy consumption is 6.1 nJ
per epoch with the resistive switching PCM devices, a factor of ~150 times
lower than conventional processor-memory systems. We analyze and discuss the
dependence of learning performance on cycle-to-cycle variations as well as
number of gradual levels in the PCM analog memory devices."
"Chemically or optically powered active matter plays an increasingly important
role in materials design but its computational potential has yet to be explored
systematically. The competition between energy consumption and dissipation
imposes stringent physical constraints on the information transport in active
flow networks, facilitating global optimization strategies that are not well
understood. Here, we combine insights from recent microbial experiments with
concepts from lattice-field theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to
introduce a generic theoretical framework for active matter logic (AML).
Highlighting conceptual differences with classical and quantum computation, we
demonstrate how the inherent non-locality of incompressible active flow
networks can be utilized to construct universal logical operations, Fredkin
gates and memory storage in SR latches through the synchronized
self-organization of many individual network components. Our work lays the
conceptual foundation for developing autonomous microfluidic transport devices
driven by bacterial fluids, active liquid crystals or chemically engineered
motile colloids."
"A general theoretical framework for Fingerprinting Localization Algorithms
(FPS), given their popularity, can be utilized for their performance studies.
In this work, after setting up an abstract model for FPS, it is shown that
fingerprinting-based localization problem can be cast as a hypothesis testing
(HT) problem and therefore various results in HT literature can be used to
provide insights, guidelines and performance bounds for general FPS. This
framework results in characterization of scaling limits of localization
reliability in terms of number of measurements and other environmental
parameters. It is suggested that Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between
probability distributions of selected feature for fingerprinting at different
locations encapsulates information about both accuracy and latency and can be
used as a central performance metric for studying FPS. Although developed for
an arbitrary fingerprint, the framework is particularly used for studying
simple Received Signal Strength (RSS)- based algorithm. The effect of various
parameters on the performance of fingerprinting algorithms is discussed, which
includes path loss and fading characteristics, number of measurements at each
point, number of anchors and their position, and placement of training points.
Representative simulations and experimentation are used to verify validity of
the theoretical frameworks in realistic setups."
"In neuroscience, population coding theory has demonstrated that
fault-tolerant information processing can be achieved by neural assemblies.
Transposed to nanoelectronics, this strategy could allow computing reliably
with ultimately scaled-down, noisy, imperfect devices. This approach requires
that the response functions to inputs of the population components form a set
of basis functions, thus offering a physical substrate for calculating. For
this purpose, the nanodevice responses should be non-linear, and each tuned to
different values of the input. These strong requirements have until now
prevented a demonstration of population coding with nanodevices. Here we show
that nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can be assembled to exhibit such
neural-like ensemble responses. We demonstrate experimentally that a population
of nine junctions can implement a basis set of functions, allowing, for
instance, the generation of cursive letters. Through simulations, we show that
systems based on interlinked populations of junctions can learn to realize low
power, variability-resilient non-linear transformations through population
coding."
"It is well-known that the Toffoli gate and the negation gate together yield a
universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: For any finite
set $A$, a finite gate set can generate all even permutations of $A^n$ for all
$n$, without any auxiliary symbols. This directly implies the previously
published result that a finite gate set can generate all permutations of $A^n$
when the cardinality of $A$ is odd, and that one auxiliary symbol is necessary
and sufficient to obtain all permutations when the cardinality of $A$ is even.
We also consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$
that preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that
records how many times each symbol occurs in the word or, more generally, the
image of the word under a fixed monoid homomorphism from $A^*$ to a commutative
monoid. It turns out that no finite conservative gate set can, for all $n$,
implement all conservative even permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits.
But we provide a finite gate set that can implement all those conservative
permutations that are even within each weight class of $A^n$."
"The memristor is the fundamental non-linear circuit element, with uses in
computing and computer memory. ReRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory) is a
resistive switching memory proposed as a non-volatile memory. In this review we
shall summarise the state of the art for these closely-related fields,
concentrating on titanium dioxide, the well-utilised and archetypal material
for both. We shall cover material properties, switching mechanisms and models
to demonstrate what ReRAM and memristor scientists can learn from each other
and examine the outlook for these technologies."
"Electronic logic gates are the basic building blocks of every computing and
micro controlling system. Logic gates are made of switches, such as diodes and
transistors. Ion-selective, ionic switches may emulate electronic switches
[1-8]. If we ever want to create artificial bio-chemical circuitry, then we
need to move a step further towards ion-logic circuitry. Here we demonstrate
ion XOR and OR gates with electrochemical cells, and specifically, with two
wet-cell batteries. In parallel to vacuum tubes, the batteries were modified to
include a third, permeable and conductive mid electrode (the gate), which was
placed between the anode and cathode in order to affect the ion flow through
it. The key is to control the cell output with a much smaller biasing power, as
demonstrated here. A successful demonstration points to self-powered ion logic
gates."
"Memristors have pinched hysteresis loops in the $V-I$ plane. Ideal memristors
are everywhere non-linear, cross at zero and are rotationally symmetric. In
this paper we extend memristor theory to produce different types of
non-ideality and find that: including a background current (such as an ionic
current) moves the crossing point away from zero; including a degradation
resistance (that increases with experimental time) leads to an asymmetry;
modelling a low resistance filament in parallel describes triangular $V-I$
curves with a straight-line low resistance state. A novel measurement of
hysteresis asymmetry was introduced based on hysteresis and it was found that
which lobe was bigger depended on the size of the breaking current relative to
the memristance. The hysteresis varied differently with each type of
non-ideality, suggesting that measurements of several device I-V curves and
calculation of these parameters could give an indication of the underlying
mechanism."
"A molecular communication channel is determined by the received signal.
Received signal models form the basis for studies focused on modulation,
receiver design, capacity, and coding depend on the received signal models.
Therefore, it is crucial to model the number of received molecules until time
$t$ analytically. Modeling the diffusion-based molecular communication channel
with the first-hitting process is an open issue for a spherical transmitter. In
this paper, we utilize the artificial neural networks technique to model the
received signal for a spherical transmitter and a perfectly absorbing receiver
(i.e., first hitting process). The proposed technique may be utilized in other
studies that assume a spherical transmitter instead of a point transmitter."
"The rapidly expanding hardware-intrinsic security primitives are aimed at
addressing significant security challenges of a massively interconnected world
in the age of information technology. The main idea of such primitives is to
employ instance-specific process-induced variations in electronic hardware as a
source of cryptographic data. Among the emergent technologies, memristive
devices provide unique opportunities for security applications due to the
underlying stochasticity in their operation. Herein, we report a prototype of a
robust, dense, and reconfigurable physical unclonable function primitives based
on the three-dimensional passive metal-oxide memristive crossbar circuits, by
making positive use of process-induced variations in the devices' nonlinear
I-Vs and their analog tuning. We first characterize security metrics for a
basic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with
monolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits.
The experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity,
measured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total,
is close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The
uniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances
of crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50%
+/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability,
measured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5%
+/- 1%. We then utilize multiple instances of the basic block to demonstrate
physically unclonable functional primitive with 10-bit hidden challenge
generation that encodes more than 10^19 challenge response pairs and has
comparable uniformity, diffusiveness, and bit error rate."
"For decades, advances in electronics were directly driven by the scaling of
CMOS transistors according to Moore's law. However, both the CMOS scaling and
the classical computer architecture are approaching fundamental and practical
limits, and new computing architectures based on emerging devices, such as
resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices, are expected to sustain the
exponential growth of computing capability. Here we propose a novel
memory-centric, reconfigurable, general purpose computing platform that is
capable of handling the explosive amount of data in a fast and energy-efficient
manner. The proposed computing architecture is based on a uniform, physical,
resistive, memory-centric fabric that can be optimally reconfigured and
utilized to perform different computing and data storage tasks in a massively
parallel approach. The system can be tailored to achieve maximal energy
efficiency based on the data flow by dynamically allocating the basic computing
fabric for storage, arithmetic, and analog computing including neuromorphic
computing tasks."
"We introduce ProjectQ, an open source software effort for quantum computing.
The first release features a compiler framework capable of targeting various
types of hardware, a high-performance simulator with emulation capabilities,
and compiler plug-ins for circuit drawing and resource estimation. We introduce
our Python-embedded domain-specific language, present the features, and provide
example implementations for quantum algorithms. The framework allows testing of
quantum algorithms through simulation and enables running them on actual
quantum hardware using a back-end connecting to the IBM Quantum Experience
cloud service. Through extension mechanisms, users can provide back-ends to
further quantum hardware, and scientists working on quantum compilation can
provide plug-ins for additional compilation, optimization, gate synthesis, and
layout strategies."
"We give a finite presentation by generators and relations of unitary
operators expressible over the $\{\mathrm{CNOT}, T, X\}$ gate set, also known
as $\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral operators. To this end, we introduce a notion of
normal form for $\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral circuits and prove that every
$\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral operator admits a unique normal form. Moreover, we
show that in the presence of certain structural rules only finitely many
circuit identities are required to reduce an arbitrary $\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral
circuit to its normal form.
  By appropriately restricting our relations, we obtain a finite presentation
of unitary operators expressible over the $\{\mathrm{CNOT}, T, X\}$ gate set as
a corollary."
"Transposition errors fundamentally undermine reliability and capacity in
molecular communication, when individual particles are used for information
encoding. Recently, several channel coding techniques have been proposed for
mitigating the transposition effect. The presented techniques show promising
results for diffusion-based channels with drift. However, so far no performance
evaluation has been carried out for diffusion-based channels without drift,
although in this case, transpositions are more prominent. In this work, we
first derive an analytical expression for the uncoded bit error probability due
to transpositions. Then, we compare the uncoded and coded error performance
over diffusion-based channels with and without drift by means of computer
simulations. The results reveal that for diffusion-based channels without drift
a transmission with reasonable reliability can only be achieved by introducing
a guard time between the codewords. This research lays the foundation for
future development of strategies to mitigate transpositions in pure
diffusion-based channels."
"Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) are non-linear dynamical systems
designed so that their equilibrium points are solutions of the Boolean problem
they solve. In a previous work [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)] it was argued that
when DMMs support solutions of the associated Boolean problem then strange
attractors cannot coexist with such equilibria. In this work, we demonstrate
such conjecture. In particular, we show that both topological transitivity and
the strongest property of topological mixing are inconsistent with the point
dissipative property of DMMs when equilibrium points are present. This is true
for both the whole phase space and the global attractor. Absence of topological
transitivity is enough to imply absence of chaotic behavior. In a similar vein,
we prove that if DMMs do not have equilibrium points, the only attractors
present are invariant tori/periodic orbits with periods that may possibly
increase with system size (quasi-attractors)."
"This paper considers multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay
communication in multi-cellular (interference) systems in which MIMO
source-destination pairs communicate simultaneously. It is assumed that due to
severe attenuation and/or shadowing effects, communication links can be
established only with the aid of a relay node. The aim is to minimize the
maximal mean-square-error (MSE) among all the receiving nodes under constrained
source and relay transmit powers. Both one- and two-way amplify-and-forward
(AF) relaying mechanisms are considered. Since the exactly optimal solution for
this practically appealing problem is intractable, we first propose optimizing
the source, relay, and receiver matrices in an alternating fashion. Then we
contrive a simplified semidefinite programming (SDP) solution based on the
error covariance matrix decomposition technique, avoiding the high complexity
of the iterative process. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the
proposed schemes."
"Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to
directly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet,
the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is
crucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of
the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use
automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also
enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum
supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a
45-qubit circuit on the Cori II supercomputer using 8,192 nodes and 0.5
petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum
circuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with
the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution
over state-of-the-art simulators by more than an order of magnitude at every
scale."
"In this paper, we propose to use magnetic nanoparticles as information
carriers for molecular communication. This enables the use of an external
magnetic field to guide information-carrying particles towards the receiver. We
show that the particle movement can be mathematically modeled as diffusion with
drift. Thereby, we reveal that the key parameters determining the magnetic
force are particle size and magnetic field gradient. As an example, we consider
magnetic nanoparticle based communication in a blood vessel. For this bounded
environment, we derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse
response subject to fluid flow and magnetic drift. Numerical results, obtained
by particle-based simulation, validate the accuracy of the derived analytical
expressions. Furthermore, adopting the symbol error rate as performance metric,
we show that using magnetic nanoparticles facilitates reliable communication,
even in the presence of fluid flow."
"Reinforcement learning involves decision making in dynamic and uncertain
environments, and constitutes one important element of artificial intelligence
(AI). In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that the ultrafast chaotic
oscillatory dynamics of lasers efficiently solve the multi-armed bandit problem
(MAB), which requires decision making concerning a class of difficult
trade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To solve the MAB, a
certain degree of randomness is required for exploration purposes. However,
pseudo-random numbers generated using conventional electronic circuitry
encounter severe limitations in terms of their data rate and the quality of
randomness due to their algorithmic foundations. We generate laser chaos
signals using a semiconductor laser sampled at a maximum rate of 100 GSample/s,
and combine it with a simple decision-making principle called tug-of-war with a
variable threshold, to ensure ultrafast, adaptive and accurate decision making
at a maximum adaptation speed of 1 GHz. We found that decision-making
performance was maximized with an optimal sampling interval, and we highlight
the exact coincidence between the negative autocorrelation inherent in laser
chaos and decision-making performance. This study paves the way for a new realm
of ultrafast photonics in the age of AI, where the ultrahigh bandwidth of
photons can provide new value."
"In this paper, we consider a diffusive mobile molecular communication (MC)
system consisting of a pair of mobile transmitter and receiver nano-machines
suspended in a fluid medium, where we model the mobility of the nano-machines
by Brownian motion. The transmitter and receiver nano-machines exchange
information via diffusive signaling molecules. Due to the random movements of
the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the statistics of the channel
impulse response (CIR) change over time. We introduce a statistical framework
for characterization of the impulse response of time-variant MC channels. In
particular, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the mean and the
autocorrelation function of the impulse response of the channel. Given the
autocorrelation function, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC
channel as a metric that characterizes the variations of the impulse response.
Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for evaluation of the expected
error probability of a simple detector for the considered system. In order to
investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the
performances of a detector with perfect channel state information (CSI)
knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the
proposed analytical expression is verified via particle-based simulation of the
Brownian motion."
"Active networks driven by local energy conversion are ubiquitous in nature,
yet little is known about how information propagates through these
far-from-equilibrium systems. Through a mathematical analogy with spin-ice
vertex models, we investigate here the input-output characteristics of generic
incompressible active flow networks (AFNs). Our analysis shows that information
transport through an AFN is inherently different from conventional pressure or
voltage driven networks. Active flows on hexagonal arrays preserve input
information over longer distances than their passive counterparts and are
highly sensitive to bulk topological defects, which can be inferred
holographically from marginal input-output distributions. This sensitivity
further allows controlled permutations on parallel inputs, revealing an
unexpected link between active matter and group theory that can guide new
microfluidic mixing strategies facilitated by active matter and aid the design
of generic autonomous information transport networks."
"In diffusion-based communication, as for molecular systems, the achievable
data rate is very low due to the slow nature of diffusion and the existence of
severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technique can be used to improve the data rate. Knowledge of channel impulse
response (CIR) is essential for equalization and detection in MIMO systems.
This paper presents a training-based CIR estimation for diffusive MIMO (D-MIMO)
channels. Maximum likelihood and least-squares estimators are derived, and the
training sequences are designed to minimize the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao
bound. Sub-optimal estimators are compared to Cram\'er-Rao bound to validate
their performance."
"This work introduces the particle-intensity channel (PIC) as a model for
molecular communication systems and characterizes the properties of the optimal
input distribution and the capacity limits for this system. In the PIC, the
transmitter encodes information, in symbols of a given duration, based on the
number of particles released, and the receiver detects and decodes the message
based on the number of particles detected during the symbol interval. In this
channel, the transmitter may be unable to control precisely the number of
particles released, and the receiver may not detect all the particles that
arrive. We demonstrate that the optimal input distribution for this channel
always has mass points at zero and the maximum number of particles that can be
released. We then consider diffusive particle transport, derive the capacity
expression when the input distribution is binary, and show conditions under
which the binary input is capacity-achieving. In particular, we demonstrate
that when the transmitter cannot generate particles at a high rate, the optimal
input distribution is binary."
"The design and analysis of communication systems typically rely on the
development of mathematical models that describe the underlying communication
channel, which dictates the relationship between the transmitted and the
received signals. However, in some systems, such as molecular communication
systems where chemical signals are used for transfer of information, it is not
possible to accurately model this relationship. In these scenarios, because of
the lack of mathematical channel models, a completely new approach to design
and analysis is required. In this work, we focus on one important aspect of
communication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by
borrowing tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that
perform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We
evaluate these algorithms using experimental data that is collected by a
chemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and
difficult to model analytically. We show that deep learning algorithms perform
significantly better than a simple detector that was used in previous works,
which also did not assume any knowledge of the channel."
"To run quantum algorithms on emerging gate-model quantum hardware, quantum
circuits must be compiled to take into account constraints on the hardware. For
near-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is
critical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the
application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits
to newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on
compiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor
constraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates
allow great flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That
freedom makes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means
there is a greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less
flexible circuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a
temporal planning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems
for QAOA circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We
report compilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on
this test set. compile circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware. This
early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning is a viable
approach to quantum circuit compilation."
"In this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer
circuits introduced by Aaronson and Gottesman in Phys. Rev. A 70(052328), 2004:
to implement a general stabilizer circuit, we reduce their 11-stage computation
-H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- over the gate set consisting of Hadamard,
Controlled-NOT, and Phase gates, into a 7-stage computation of the form
-C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the
-C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a shorter layered
expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement
compared to the -C- stages. Based on this decomposition, we develop a two-qubit
gate depth-$(14n{-}4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate
library {H, P, CNOT}, executable in the LNN architecture, improving best
previously known depth-$25n$ circuit, also executable in the LNN architecture.
Our constructions rely on Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group and on
folding arbitrarily long sequences of the form $($-P-C-$)^m$ into a 3-stage
computation -P-CZ-C-. Our results include the reduction of the $11$-stage
decomposition -H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- into a $9$-stage decomposition of the
form -C-P-C-P-H-C-P-C-P-. This reduction is based on the Bruhat decomposition
of the symplectic group. This result also implies a new normal form for
stabilizer circuits. We show that a circuit in this normal form is optimal in
the number of Hadamard gates used. We also show that the normal form has an
asymptotically optimal number of parameters."
"Recent advancements in quantum annealing hardware and numerous studies in
this area suggests that quantum annealers have the potential to be effective in
solving unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems. Naturally, one may
desire to expand the application domain of these machines to problems with
general discrete variables. In this paper, we explore the possibility of
employing quantum annealers to solve unconstrained quadratic programming
problems over a bounded integer domain. We present an approach for encoding
integer variables into binary ones, thereby representing unconstrained integer
quadratic programming problems as unconstrained binary quadratic programming
problems. To respect some of the limitations of the currently developed quantum
annealers, we propose an integer encoding, named bounded- coefficient encoding,
in which we limit the size of the coefficients that appear in the encoding.
Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for finding the upper bound on the
coefficients of the encoding using the precision of the machine and the
coefficients of the original integer problem. Finally, we experimentally show
that this approach is far more resilient to the noise of the quantum annealers
compared to traditional approaches for the encoding of integers in base two."
"This paper studies spatial diversity techniques applied to multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) diffusion-based molecular communications (DBMC). Two
types of spatial coding techniques, namely Alamouti-type coding and repetition
MIMO coding are suggested and analyzed. In addition, we consider receiver-side
equal-gain combining, which is equivalent to maximum-ratio combining in
symmetrical scenarios. For numerical analysis, the channel impulse responses of
a symmetrical $2 \times 2$ MIMO-DBMC system are acquired by a trained
artificial neural network. It is demonstrated that spatial diversity has the
potential to improve the system performance and that repetition MIMO coding
outperforms Alamouti-type coding."
"Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment
agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct
research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of
disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their
functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally,
building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as
mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy
management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled environment
device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper
presents the OpenAg Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size
platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also
hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12).
The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can
be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its
modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities."
"In this work, spatial diversity techniques in the area of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) diffusion-based molecular communications (DBMC) are
investigated. For transmitter-side spatial coding, Alamouti-type coding and
repetition MIMO coding are proposed and analyzed. At the receiver-side,
selection diversity, equal-gain combining, and maximum-ratio combining are
studied as combining strategies. Throughout the numerical analysis, a
symmetrical $2\times 2$ MIMO-DBMC system is assumed. Furthermore, a trained
artificial neural network is utilized to acquire the channel impulse responses.
The numerical analysis demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a diversity
gain in molecular communications. In addition, it is shown that for MIMO-DBMC
systems repetition MIMO coding is superior to Alamouti-type coding."
"We present in this paper our work regarding simulating a type of P system
known as a spiking neural P system (SNP system) using graphics processing units
(GPUs). GPUs, because of their architectural optimization for parallel
computations, are well-suited for highly parallelizable problems. Due to the
advent of general purpose GPU computing in recent years, GPUs are not limited
to graphics and video processing alone, but include computationally intensive
scientific and mathematical applications as well. Moreover P systems, including
SNP systems, are inherently and maximally parallel computing models whose
inspirations are taken from the functioning and dynamics of a living cell. In
particular, SNP systems try to give a modest but formal representation of a
special type of cell known as the neuron and their interactions with one
another. The nature of SNP systems allowed their representation as matrices,
which is a crucial step in simulating them on highly parallel devices such as
GPUs. The highly parallel nature of SNP systems necessitate the use of hardware
intended for parallel computations. The simulation algorithms, design
considerations, and implementation are presented. Finally, simulation results,
observations, and analyses using an SNP system that generates all numbers in
$\mathbb N$ - {1} are discussed, as well as recommendations for future work."
"This volume represents the proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Membrane
Computing and Biologically Inspired Process Calculi (MeCBIC 2011), held

August 2011 in Fontainebleau, France."
"Energy transfer between photons and molecules and between neighboring
molecules is ubiquitous in living nature, most prominently in photosynthesis.
While energy transfer is efficiently utilized by living systems, its adoption
to connect individual components in man-made plasmonic nanocircuits has been
challenged by low transfer efficiencies which motivate the development of
entirely new concepts for energy transfer. We introduce herein optoplasmonic
superlenses that combine the capability of optical microcavities to insulate
molecule-photon systems from decohering environmental effects with the superior
light nanoconcentration properties of nanoantennas. The proposed structures
provide significant enhancement of the emitter radiative rate and efficient
long-range transfer of emitted photons followed by subsequent re-focusing into
nanoscale volumes accessible to near- and far-field detection. Optoplasmonic
superlenses are versatile building blocks for optoplasmonic nanocircuits and
can be used to construct ""dark"" single molecule sensors, resonant amplifiers,
nanoconcentrators, frequency multiplexers, demultiplexers, energy converters
and dynamical switches."
"A large effort is devoted to the research of new computing paradigms
associated to innovative nanotechnologies that should complement and/or propose
alternative solutions to the classical Von Neumann/CMOS association. Among
various propositions, Spiking Neural Network (SNN) seems a valid candidate. (i)
In terms of functions, SNN using relative spike timing for information coding
are deemed to be the most effective at taking inspiration from the brain to
allow fast and efficient processing of information for complex tasks in
recognition or classification. (ii) In terms of technology, SNN may be able to
benefit the most from nanodevices, because SNN architectures are intrinsically
tolerant to defective devices and performance variability. Here we demonstrate
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a basic and primordial learning
function in the brain, with a new class of synapstor (synapse-transistor),
called Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field Effect Transistor (NOMFET). We show
that this learning function is obtained with a simple hybrid material made of
the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and organic semiconductor thin films.
Beyond mimicking biological synapses, we also demonstrate how the shape of the
applied spikes can tailor the STDP learning function. Moreover, the experiments
and modeling show that this synapstor is a memristive device. Finally, these
synapstors are successfully coupled with a CMOS platform emulating the pre- and
post-synaptic neurons, and a behavioral macro-model is developed on usual
device simulator."
"We propose an easy-to-implement hard-decision majority-logic decoding
algorithm for Reed-Muller codes RM(r,m) with m >= 3, m/2 >= r >= 1. The
presented algorithm outperforms the best known majority-logic decoding
algorithms and offers highly parallel decoding. The result is of special
importance for safety- and time-critical applications in embedded systems. A
simple combinational circuit can perform the proposed decoding. In particular,
we show how our decoder for the three-error-correcting code RM(2,5) of
dimension 16 and length 32 can be realized on hardware level."
"Reservoir computing is a recently introduced, highly efficient bio-inspired
approach for processing time dependent data. The basic scheme of reservoir
computing consists of a non linear recurrent dynamical system coupled to a
single input layer and a single output layer. Within these constraints many
implementations are possible. Here we report an opto-electronic implementation
of reservoir computing based on a recently proposed architecture consisting of
a single non linear node and a delay line. Our implementation is sufficiently
fast for real time information processing. We illustrate its performance on
tasks of practical importance such as nonlinear channel equalization and speech
recognition, and obtain results comparable to state of the art digital
implementations."
"Short-length Reed--Muller codes under majority-logic decoding are of
particular importance for efficient hardware implementations in real-time and
embedded systems. This paper significantly improves Chen's two-step
majority-logic decoding method for binary Reed--Muller codes $\text{RM}(r,m)$,
$r \leq m/2$, if --- systematic encoding assumed --- only errors at information
positions are to be corrected. Some general results on the minimal number of
majority gates are presented that are particularly good for short codes.
Specifically, with its importance in applications as a 3-error-correcting,
self-dual code, the smallest non-trivial example, $\text{RM}(2,5)$ of dimension
16 and length 32, is investigated in detail. Further, the decoding complexity
of our procedure is compared with that of Chen's decoding algorithm for various
Reed--Muller codes up to length $2^{10}$."
"We propose a novel molecular computing approach based on reservoir computing.
In reservoir computing, a dynamical core, called a reservoir, is perturbed with
an external input signal while a readout layer maps the reservoir dynamics to a
target output. Computation takes place as a transformation from the input space
to a high-dimensional spatiotemporal feature space created by the transient
dynamics of the reservoir. The readout layer then combines these features to
produce the target output. We show that coupled deoxyribozyme oscillators can
act as the reservoir. We show that despite using only three coupled
oscillators, a molecular reservoir computer could achieve 90% accuracy on a
benchmark temporal problem."
"We introduce the notion of universal memcomputing machines (UMMs): a class of
brain-inspired general-purpose computing machines based on systems with memory,
whereby processing and storing of information occur on the same physical
location. We analytically prove that the memory properties of UMMs endow them
with universal computing power - they are Turing-complete -, intrinsic
parallelism, functional polymorphism, and information overhead, namely their
collective states can support exponential data compression directly in memory.
We also demonstrate that a UMM has the same computational power as a
non-deterministic Turing machine, namely it can solve NP--complete problems in
polynomial time. However, by virtue of its information overhead, a UMM needs
only an amount of memory cells (memprocessors) that grows polynomially with the
problem size. As an example we provide the polynomial-time solution of the
subset-sum problem and a simple hardware implementation of the same. Even
though these results do not prove the statement NP=P within the Turing
paradigm, the practical realization of these UMMs would represent a paradigm
shift from present von Neumann architectures bringing us closer to brain-like
neural computation."
"We show that, in tantalum oxide resistive memories, activation power provides
a multi-level variable for information storage that can be set and read
separately from the resistance. These two state variables (resistance and
activation power) can be precisely controlled in two steps: (1) the possible
activation power states are selected by partially reducing resistance, then (2)
a subsequent partial increase in resistance specifies the resistance state and
the final activation power state. We show that these states can be precisely
written and read electrically, making this approach potentially amenable for
ultra-high density memories. We provide a theoretical explanation for
information storage and retrieval from activation power and experimentally
demonstrate information storage in a third dimension related to the change in
activation power with resistance."
"In this paper, we propose a general model to study the full-duplex
non-coherent decode-and-forward Gaussian relay channel with energy harvesting
(EH) nodes, called NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$, in three cases: $i)$ no energy
transfer (ET), $ii)$ one-way ET from the source (S) to the relay (R), and
$iii)$ two-way ET. We consider the problem of optimal power allocation in
NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$ in order to maximize the total transmitted bits from S to
the destination in a given time duration. General stochastic energy arrivals at
S and R with known EH times and values are assumed. In NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$
with no ET, the complicated min-max optimization form along with its
constraints make the problem intractable. It is shown that this problem can be
transformed to a solvable convex form; however, convex optimization solution
does not provide the structural properties of the optimal solution. Therefore,
following an alternative perspective, we investigate conditions on harvesting
process of S and R where we find optimal algorithmic solution. Further, we
propose some suboptimal algorithms and provide some examples, in which the
algorithms are optimal. Moreover, we find a class of problems for
NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$ with one-way ET from S to R, where the optimal algorithmic
solution is devised. For NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$ with two-way ET, we propose
\emph{general} optimal algorithmic solution. Furthermore, the performance of
the proposed algorithms are evaluated numerically and compared with optimal
numerical convex optimization tools."
"By harnessing quantum effects, we nowadays can use encryption that is in
principle proven to withstand any conceivable attack. These fascinating quantum
features have been implemented in metropolitan quantum networks around the
world. In order to interconnect such networks over long distances, optical
satellite communication is the method of choice. Standard telecommunication
components allow one to efficiently implement quantum communication by
measuring field quadratures (continuous variables). This opens the possibility
to adapt our Laser Communication Terminals (LCTs) to quantum key distribution
(QKD). First satellite measurement campaigns are currently validating our
approach."
"An example of a nonspecific molecular bond is the affinity of any positive
charge for any negative charge (like-unlike), or of nonpolar material for
itself when in aqueous solution (like-like). This contrasts specific bonds such
as the affinity of the DNA base A for T, but not for C, G, or another A. Recent
experimental breakthroughs in DNA nanotechnology demonstrate that a particular
nonspecific like-like bond (""blunt-end DNA stacking"" that occurs between the
ends of any pair of DNA double-helices) can be used to create specific
""macrobonds"" by careful geometric arrangement of many nonspecific blunt ends,
motivating the need for sets of macrobonds that are orthogonal: two macrobonds
not intended to bind should have relatively low binding strength, even when
misaligned.
  To address this need, we introduce geometric orthogonal codes that abstractly
model the engineered DNA macrobonds as two-dimensional binary codewords. While
motivated by completely different applications, geometric orthogonal codes
share similar features to the optical orthogonal codes studied by Chung,
Salehi, and Wei. The main technical difference is the importance of 2D geometry
in defining codeword orthogonality."
"The measurement of quantum signals that traveled through long distances is of
fundamental and technological interest. We present quantum-limited coherent
measurements of optical signals, sent from a satellite in geostationary Earth
orbit to an optical ground station. We bound the excess noise that the quantum
states could have acquired after having propagated 38600 km through Earth's
gravitational potential as well as its turbulent atmosphere. Our results
indicate that quantum communication is feasible in principle in such a
scenario, highlighting the possibility of a global quantum key distribution
network for secure communication."
"This work presents a new multi-chemical experimental platform for molecular
communication where the transmitter can release different chemicals. This
platform is designed to be inexpensive and accessible, and it can be expanded
to simulate different environments including the cardiovascular system and
complex network of pipes in industrial complexes and city infrastructures. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the platform, we implement a time-slotted
binary communication system where a bit-0 is represented by an acid pulse, a
bit-1 by a base pulse, and information is carried via pH signals. The channel
model for this system, which is nonlinear and has long memories, is unknown.
Therefore, we devise novel detection algorithms that use techniques from
machine learning and deep learning to train a maximum-likelihood detector.
Using these algorithms the bit error rate improves by an order of magnitude
relative to the approach used in previous works. Moreover, our system achieves
a data rate that is an order of magnitude higher than any of the previous
molecular communication platforms."
"Physarum Polycephalum is a slime mold that is apparently able to solve
shortest path problems.
  A mathematical model has been proposed by biologists to describe the feedback
mechanism used by the slime mold to adapt its tubular channels while foraging
two food sources s0 and s1. We prove that, under this model, the mass of the
mold will eventually converge to the shortest s0 - s1 path of the network that
the mold lies on, independently of the structure of the network or of the
initial mass distribution.
  This matches the experimental observations by the biologists and can be seen
as an example of a ""natural algorithm"", that is, an algorithm developed by
evolution over millions of years."
"In this paper we present a connection between two dynamical systems arising
in entirely different contexts: one in signal processing and the other in
biology. The first is the famous Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)
algorithm used in compressed sensing and sparse recovery while the second is
the dynamics of a slime mold (Physarum polycephalum). Both of these dynamics
are geared towards finding a minimum l1-norm solution in an affine subspace.
Despite its simplicity the convergence of the IRLS method has been shown only
for a certain regularization of it and remains an important open problem. Our
first result shows that the two dynamics are projections of the same dynamical
system in higher dimensions. As a consequence, and building on the recent work
on Physarum dynamics, we are able to prove convergence and obtain complexity
bounds for a damped version of the IRLS algorithm."
