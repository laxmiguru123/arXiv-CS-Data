summary
"We develop and analyze algorithms for dispersing a swarm of primitive robots
in an unknown environment, R. The primary objective is to minimize the
makespan, that is, the time to fill the entire region. An environment is
composed of pixels that form a connected subset of the integer grid.
  There is at most one robot per pixel and robots move horizontally or
vertically at unit speed. Robots enter R by means of k>=1 door pixels
  Robots are primitive finite automata, only having local communication, local
sensors, and a constant-sized memory.
  We first give algorithms for the single-door case (i.e., k=1), analyzing the
algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. We prove that our algorithms
have optimal makespan 2A-1, where A is the area of R.
  We next give an algorithm for the multi-door case (k>1), based on a
wall-following version of the leader-follower strategy. We prove that our
strategy is O(log(k+1))-competitive, and that this bound is tight for our
strategy and other related strategies."
"A double pendulum subject to external torques is used as a model to study the
stability of a planar manipulator with two links and two rotational driven
joints. The hamiltonian equations of motion and the fixed points (stationary
solutions) in phase space are determined. Under suitable conditions, the
presence of constant torques does not change the number of fixed points, and
preserves the topology of orbits in their linear neighborhoods; two equivalent
invariant manifolds are observed, each corresponding to a saddle-center fixed
point."
"Deterministic replay is a method for allowing complex multitasking real-time
systems to be debugged using standard interactive debuggers. Even though
several replay techniques have been proposed for parallel, multi-tasking and
real-time systems, the solutions have so far lingered on a prototype academic
level, with very little results to show from actual state-of-the-practice
commercial applications. This paper describes a major deterministic replay
debugging case study performed on a full-scale industrial robot control system,
as well as a minor replay instrumentation case study performed on a military
aircraft radar system. In this article, we will show that replay debugging is
feasible in complex multi-million lines of code software projects running on
top of off-the-shelf real-time operating systems. Furthermore, we will discuss
how replay debugging can be introduced in existing systems without
impracticable analysis efforts. In addition, we will present benchmarking
results from both studies, indicating that the instrumentation overhead is
acceptable and affordable."
"Mobile robots have received a great deal of research in recent years. A
significant amount of research has been published in many aspects related to
mobile robots. Most of the research is devoted to design and develop some
control techniques for robot motion and path planning. A large number of
researchers have used kinematic models to develop motion control strategy for
mobile robots. Their argument and assumption that these models are valid if the
robot has low speed, low acceleration and light load. However, dynamic
modelling of mobile robots is very important as they are designed to travel at
higher speed and perform heavy duty work. This paper presents and discusses a
new approach to develop a dynamic model and control strategy for wheeled mobile
robot which I modelled as a rigid body that roles on two wheels and a castor.
The motion control strategy consists of two levels. The first level is dealing
with the dynamic of the system and denoted as Low level controller. The second
level is developed to take care of path planning and trajectory generation."
"An adaptive Monte Carlo localization algorithm based on coevolution mechanism
of ecological species is proposed. Samples are clustered into species, each of
which represents a hypothesis of the robots pose. Since the coevolution between
the species ensures that the multiple distinct hypotheses can be tracked
stably, the problem of premature convergence when using MCL in highly symmetric
environments can be solved. And the sample size can be adjusted adaptively over
time according to the uncertainty of the robots pose by using the population
growth model. In addition, by using the crossover and mutation operators in
evolutionary computation, intra-species evolution can drive the samples move
towards the regions where the desired posterior density is large. So a small
size of samples can represent the desired density well enough to make precise
localization. The new algorithm is termed coevolution based adaptive Monte
Carlo localization (CEAMCL). Experiments have been carried out to prove the
efficiency of the new localization algorithm."
"The study of the collaboration, coordination and negotiation among different
agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) has always been the most challenging yet
popular in the research of distributed artificial intelligence. In this paper,
we will suggest for RoboCup simulation, a typical MAS, a general
decision-making model, rather than define a different algorithm for each tactic
(e.g. ball handling, pass, shoot and interception, etc.) in soccer games as
most RoboCup simulation teams did. The general decision-making model is based
on two critical factors in soccer games: the vertical distance to the goal line
and the visual angle for the goalpost. We have used these two parameters to
formalize the defensive and offensive decisions in RoboCup simulation and the
results mentioned above had been applied in NOVAURO, original name is UJDB, a
RoboCup simulation team of Jiangsu University, whose decision-making model,
compared with that of Tsinghua University, the world champion team in 2001, is
a universal model and easier to be implemented."
"In this second of three short papers, I introduce some of the basic concepts
of space robotics with an emphasis on some specific challenging areas of
research that are peculiar to the application of robotics to space
infrastructure development. The style of these short papers is pedagogical and
the concepts in this paper are developed from fundamental manipulator robotics.
This second paper considers the application of space manipulators to on-orbit
servicing (OOS), an application which has considerable commercial application.
I provide some background to the notion of robotic on-orbit servicing and
explore how manipulator control algorithms may be modified to accommodate space
manipulators which operate in the micro-gravity of space."
"The single wheel, gyroscopically stabilized robot - Gyrover, is a dynamically
stable but statically unstable, underactuated system. In this paper, based on
the dynamic model of the robot, we investigate two classes of nonholonomic
constraints associated with the system. Then, based on the backstepping
technology, we propose a control law for balance control of Gyrover. Next,
through transferring the systems states from Cartesian coordinate to polar
coordinate, control laws for point-to-point control and line tracking in
Cartesian space are provided."
"The sewer inspection robot MAKRO is an autonomous multi-segment robot with
worm-like shape driven by wheels. It is currently under development in the
project MAKRO-PLUS. The robot has to navigate autonomously within sewer
systems. Its first tasks will be to take water probes, analyze it onboard, and
measure positions of manholes and pipes to detect polluted-loaded sewage and to
improve current maps of sewer systems. One of the challenging problems is the
controller software, which should enable the robot to navigate in the sewer
system and perform the inspection tasks autonomously, not inflicting any
self-damage. This paper focuses on the route planning and replanning aspect of
the robot. The robots software has four different levels, of which the planning
system is the highest level, and the remaining three are controller levels each
with a different degree of abstraction. The planner coordinates the sequence of
actions that are to be successively executed by the robot."

"A rigid-flexible manipulator may be assigned tasks in a moving environment
where the winds or vibrations affect the position and/or orientation of surface
of operation. Consequently, losses of the contact and perhaps degradation of
the performance may occur as references are changed. When the environment is
moving, knowledge of the angle &#945; between the contact surface and the
horizontal is required at every instant. In this paper, different profiles for
the time varying angle &#945; are proposed to investigate the effect of this
change into the contact force and the joint torques of a rigid-flexible
manipulator. The coefficients of the equation of the proposed rotating surface
are changing with time to determine the new X and Y coordinates of the moving
surface as the surface rotates."
"The authors propose the implementation of hybrid Fuzzy Logic-Genetic
Algorithm (FL-GA) methodology to plan the automatic assembly and disassembly
sequence of products. The GA-Fuzzy Logic approach is implemented onto two
levels. The first level of hybridization consists of the development of a Fuzzy
controller for the parameters of an assembly or disassembly planner based on
GAs. This controller acts on mutation probability and crossover rate in order
to adapt their values dynamically while the algorithm runs. The second level
consists of the identification of theoptimal assembly or disassembly sequence
by a Fuzzy function, in order to obtain a closer control of the technological
knowledge of the assembly/disassembly process. Two case studies were analyzed
in order to test the efficiency of the Fuzzy-GA methodologies."
"Traditionally, cardiac surgery has been performed through a median
sternotomy, which allows the surgeon generous access to the heart and
surrounding great vessels. As a paradigm shift in the size and location of
incisions occurs in cardiac surgery, new methods have been developed to allow
the surgeon the same amount of dexterity and accessibility to the heart in
confined spaces and in a less invasive manner. Initially, long instruments
without pivot points were used, however, more recent robotic telemanipulation
systems have been applied that allow for improved dexterity, enabling the
surgeon to perform cardiac surgery from a distance not previously possible. In
this rapidly evolving field, we review the recent history and clinical results
of using robotics in cardiac surgery."
"This paper introduces a six-legged autonomous robot managed by a single
controller and a software core modeled on subsumption architecture. We begin by
discussing the features and capabilities of IsoPod, a new processor for
robotics which has enabled a streamlined implementation of our project. We
argue that this processor offers a unique set of hardware and software
features, making it a practical development platform for robotics in general
and for subsumption-based control architectures in particular. Next, we
summarize original ideas on subsumption architecture implementation for a
six-legged robot, as presented by its inventor Rodney Brooks in 1980s. A
comparison is then made to a more recent example of a hexapod control
architecture based on subsumption. The merits of both systems are analyzed and
a new subsumption architecture layout is formulated as a response. We conclude
with some remarks regarding the development of this project as a hint at new
potentials for intelligent robot design, opened by a recent development in
embedded controller market."
"In this paper is presented an approach to achieving on-line modification of
nominal biped gait without recomputing entire dynamics when steady motion is
performed. Straight, dynamically balanced walk was used as a nominal gait, and
applied modifications were speed-up and slow-down walk and turning left and
right. It is shown that the disturbances caused by these modifications
jeopardize dynamic stability, but they can be simply compensated to enable walk
continuation."
"We present methods that generate cooperative strategies for multi-vehicle
control problems using a decomposition approach. By introducing a set of tasks
to be completed by the team of vehicles and a task execution method for each
vehicle, we decomposed the problem into a combinatorial component and a
continuous component. The continuous component of the problem is captured by
task execution, and the combinatorial component is captured by task assignment.
In this paper, we present a solver for task assignment that generates
near-optimal assignments quickly and can be used in real-time applications. To
motivate our methods, we apply them to an adversarial game between two teams of
vehicles. One team is governed by simple rules and the other by our algorithms.
In our study of this game we found phase transitions, showing that the task
assignment problem is most difficult to solve when the capabilities of the
adversaries are comparable. Finally, we implement our algorithms in a
multi-level architecture with a variable replanning rate at each level to
provide feedback on a dynamically changing and uncertain environment."
"Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for planning and
control problems because of its modeling capability and the availability of
good solvers. However, for large models, MILP methods suffer computationally.
In this paper, we present iterative MILP algorithms that address this issue. We
consider trajectory generation problems with obstacle avoidance requirements
and minimum time trajectory generation problems. The algorithms use fewer
binary variables than standard MILP methods and require less computational
effort."
"Automobile has become the dominant transport mode in the world in the last
century. In order to meet a continuously growing demand for transport, one
solution is to change the control approach for vehicle to full driving
automation, which removes the driver from the control loop to improve
efficiency and reduce accidents. Recent work shows that there are several
realistic paths towards this deployment : driving assistance on passenger cars,
automated commercial vehicles on dedicated infrastructures, and new forms of
urban transport (car-sharing and cybercars). Cybercars have already been put
into operation in Europe, and it seems that this approach could lead the way
towards full automation on most urban, and later interurban infrastructures.
The European project CyberCars has brought many improvements in the technology
needed to operate cybercars over the last three years. A new, larger European
project is now being prepared to carry this work further in order to meet more
ambitious objectives in terms of safety and efficiency. This paper will present
past and present technologies and will focus on the future developments."
"It is very important for quadruped walking machine to keep its stability in
high speed walking. It has been indicated that moment around the supporting
diagonal line of quadruped in trotting gait largely influences walking
stability. In this paper, moment around the supporting diagonal line of
quadruped in trotting gait is modeled and its effects on body attitude are
analyzed. The degree of influence varies with different initial stances of
quadruped and we get the optimal initial stance of quadruped in trotting gait
with maximal walking stability. Simulation results are presented. Keywords:
quadruped, trotting, attitude, walking stability."
"The goal is the development of a simultaneous, dynamic, technological as well
as logistical real-time planning and an organizational control of the
production by the production units themselves, working in the production
network under the use of Multi-Agent-Technology. The design of the
multi-agent-based manufacturing management system, the models of the single
agents, algorithms for the agent-based, decentralized dispatching of orders,
strategies and data management concepts as well as their integration into the
SCM, basing on the solution described, will be explained in the following.
  Keywords: production engineering and management, dynamic manufacturing
planning and control, multi-agentsystems (MAS), supply-chain-management (SCM),
e-manufacturing"
"The approximate nonlinear receding-horizon control law is used to treat the
trajectory tracking control problem of rigid link robot manipulators. The
derived nonlinear predictive law uses a quadratic performance index of the
predicted tracking error and the predicted control effort. A key feature of
this control law is that, for their implementation, there is no need to perform
an online optimization, and asymptotic tracking of smooth reference
trajectories is guaranteed. It is shown that this controller achieves the
positions tracking objectives via link position measurements. The stability
convergence of the output tracking error to the origin is proved. To enhance
the robustness of the closed loop system with respect to payload uncertainties
and viscous friction, an integral action is introduced in the loop. A nonlinear
observer is used to estimate velocity. Simulation results for a two-link rigid
robot are performed to validate the performance of the proposed controller.
  Keywords: receding-horizon control, nonlinear observer, robot manipulators,
integral action, robustness."
"In the past few years, the European Commission has financed several projects
to examine how new technologies could improve the sustainability of European
cities. These technologies concern new public transportation modes such as
guided buses to form high capacity networks similar to light rail but at a
lower cost and better flexibility, PRT (Personal Rapid Transit) and cybercars
(small urban vehicles with fully automatic driving capabilities to be used in
carsharing mode, mostly as a complement to mass transport). They also concern
private vehicles with technologies which could improve the efficiency of the
vehicles as well as their safety (Intelligent Speed Adaptation, Adaptive Cruise
>.Control, Stop&Go, Lane Keeping,...) and how these new vehicles can complement
mass transport in the form of car-sharing services."
"Path planning and obstacle avoidance are the two major issues in any
navigation system. Wavefront propagation algorithm, as a good path planner, can
be used to determine an optimal path. Obstacle avoidance can be achieved using
possibility theory. Combining these two functions enable a robot to
autonomously navigate to its destination. This paper presents the approach and
results in implementing an autonomous navigation system for an indoor mobile
robot. The system developed is based on a laser sensor used to retrieve data to
update a two dimensional world model of therobot environment. Waypoints in the
path are incorporated into the obstacle avoidance. Features such as ageing of
objects and smooth motion planning are implemented to enhance efficiency and
also to cater for dynamic environments."
"This paper presents a robust control scheme for flexible link robotic
manipulators, which is based on considering the flexible mechanical structure
as a system with slow (rigid) and fast (flexible) modes that can be controlled
separately. The rigid dynamics is controlled by means of a robust sliding-mode
approach with wellestablished stability properties while an LQR optimal design
is adopted for the flexible dynamics. Experimental results show that this
composite approach achieves good closed loop tracking properties both for the
rigid and the flexible dynamics."
"This paper presents a new architecture called FAIS for imple- menting
intelligent agents cooperating in a special Multi Agent environ- ment, namely
the RoboCup Rescue Simulation System. This is a layered architecture which is
customized for solving fire extinguishing problem. Structural decision making
algorithms are combined with heuristic ones in this model, so it's a hybrid
architecture."
"This paper investigates the problem of the dynamic balance control of
multi-arm free-floating space robot during capturing an active object in close
proximity. The position and orientation of space base will be affected during
the operation of space manipulator because of the dynamics coupling between the
manipulator and space base. This dynamics coupling is unique characteristics of
space robot system. Such a disturbance will produce a serious impact between
the manipulator hand and the object. To ensure reliable and precise operation,
we propose to develop a space robot system consisting of two arms, with one arm
(mission arm) for accomplishing the capture mission, and the other one (balance
arm) compensating for the disturbance of the base. We present the coordinated
control concept for balance of the attitude of the base using the balance arm.
The mission arm can move along the given trajectory to approach and capture the
target with no considering the disturbance from the coupling of the base. We
establish a relationship between the motion of two arm that can realize the
zeros reaction to the base. The simulation studies verified the validity and
efficiency of the proposed control method."
"A resolved acceleration control (RAC) and proportional-integral active force
control (PIAFC) is proposed as an approach for the robust motion control of a
mobile manipulator (MM) comprising a differentially driven wheeled mobile
platform with a two-link planar arm mounted on top of the platform. The study
emphasizes on the integrated kinematic and dynamic control strategy in which
the RAC is used to manipulate the kinematic component while the PIAFC is
implemented to compensate the dynamic effects including the bounded
known/unknown disturbances and uncertainties. The effectivenss and robustness
of the proposed scheme are investigated through a rigorous simulation study and
later complemented with experimental results obtained through a number of
experiments performed on a fully developed working prototype in a laboratory
environment. A number of disturbances in the form of vibratory and impact
forces are deliberately introduced into the system to evaluate the system
performances. The investigation clearly demonstrates the extreme robustness
feature of the proposed control scheme compared to other systems considered in
the study."
"This paper is a summary of the recently accomplished research work on
flexible gripping systems. The goal is to develop a gripper which can be used
for a great amount of geometrically variant workpieces. The economic aspect is
of particular importance during the whole development. The high flexibility of
the gripper is obtained by three parallel used principles. These are human and
computer based analysis of the gripping object as well as mechanical adaptation
of the gripper to the object with the help of servo motors. The focus is on the
gripping of free-form surfaces with suction cup."
"At present, the research on robot team cooperation is still in qualitative
analysis phase and lacks the description model that can quantitatively describe
the dynamical evolution of team cooperative relationships with constantly
changeable task demand in Multi-robot field. First this paper whole and static
describes organization model HWROM of robot team, then uses Markov course and
Bayesian theorem for reference, dynamical describes the team cooperative
relationships building. Finally from cooperative entity layer, ability layer
and relative layer we research team formation and cooperative mechanism, and
discuss how to optimize relative action sets during the evolution. The dynamic
evolution model of robot team and cooperative relationships between robot teams
proposed and described in this paper can not only generalize the robot team as
a whole, but also depict the dynamic evolving process quantitatively. Users can
also make the prediction of the cooperative relationship and the action of the
robot team encountering new demands based on this model. Journal web page & a

"There is a belief that complexity and chaos are essential for adaptability.
But life deals with complexity every moment, without the chaos that engineers
fear so, by invoking goal-directed behaviour. Goals can be programmed. That is
why living organisms give us hope to achieve adaptability in robots. In this
paper a method for the description of a goal-directed, or programmed,
behaviour, interacting with uncertainty of environment, is described. We
suggest reducing the structural (goals, intentions) and stochastic components
(probability to realise the goal) of individual behaviour to random variables
with nominal values to apply probabilistic approach. This allowed us to use a
Normalized Entropy Index to detect the system state by estimating the
contribution of each agent to the group behaviour. The number of possible group
states is 27. We argue that adaptation has a limited number of possible paths
between these 27 states. Paths and states can be programmed so that after
adjustment to any particular case of task and conditions, adaptability will
never involve chaos. We suggest the application of the model to operation of
robots or other devices in remote and/or dangerous places."
"This is a presentation of a new system for invariant recognition of 2D
objects with overlapping classes, that can not be effectively recognized with
the traditional methods. The translation, scale and partial rotation invariant
contour object description is transformed in a DCT spectrum space. The obtained
frequency spectrums are decomposed into frequency bands in order to feed
different BPG neural nets (NNs). The NNs are structured in three stages -
filtering and full rotation invariance; partial recognition; general
classification. The designed multi-stage BPG Neural Structure shows very good
accuracy and flexibility when tested with 2D objects used in the discontinuous
production. The reached speed and the opportunuty for an easy restructuring and
reprogramming of the system makes it suitable for application in different
applied systems for real time work."
"A good organization model of multiple mobile robot should be able to improve
the efficiency of the system, reduce the complication of robot interactions,
and detract the difficulty of computation. From the sociology aspect of
topology, structure and organization, this paper studies the multiple mobile
robot organization formation and running mechanism in the dynamic, complicated
and unknown environment. It presents and describes in detail a Hierarchical-
Web Recursive Organization Model (HWROM) and forming algorithm. It defines the
robot society leader; robotic team leader and individual robot as the same
structure by the united framework and describes the organization model by the
recursive structure. The model uses task-oriented and top-down method to
dynamically build and maintain structures and organization. It uses
market-based techniques to assign task, form teams and allocate resources in
dynamic environment. The model holds several characteristics of
self-organization, dynamic, conciseness, commonness and robustness."
"Optimal point-to-point trajectory planning for planar redundant manipulator
is considered in this study. The main objective is to minimize the sum of the
position error of the end-effector at each intermediate point along the
trajectory so that the end-effector can track the prescribed trajectory
accurately. An algorithm combining Genetic Algorithm and Pattern Search as a
Generalized Pattern Search GPS is introduced to design the optimal trajectory.
To verify the proposed algorithm, simulations for a 3-D-O-F planar manipulator
with different end-effector trajectories have been carried out. A comparison
between the Genetic Algorithm and the Generalized Pattern Search shows that The
GPS gives excellent tracking performance."
"This paper presents a robotics vision-based heuristic reasoning system for
underwater target tracking and navigation. This system is introduced to improve
the level of automation of underwater Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs)
operations. A prototype which combines computer vision with an underwater
robotics system is successfully designed and developed to perform target
tracking and intelligent navigation. ..."
"This paper presents a new concept of a mobile robot speed control by using
two degree of freedom gear transmission. The developed intelligent speed
controller utilizes a gear box which comprises of epicyclic gear train with two
inputs, one coupled with the engine shaft and another with the shaft of a
variable speed dc motor. The net output speed is a combination of the two input
speeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train.
This new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise
an indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby
reducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling. By
gradually varying the speed of the dc motor a stepless transmission has been
achieved. The other advantages of the developed controller are pulling over and
reversing the vehicle, implemented by intelligent mixing of the dc motor and
engine speeds. This approach eliminates traditional braking system in entire
vehicle design. The use of two power sources, IC engine and battery driven DC
motor, utilizes the modern idea of hybrid vehicles. The new mobile robot speed
controller is capable of driving the vehicle even in extreme case of IC engine
failure, for example, due to gas depletion."
"This article proposes the first known algorithm that achieves a
constant-factor approximation of the minimum length tour for a Dubins' vehicle
through $n$ points on the plane. By Dubins' vehicle, we mean a vehicle
constrained to move at constant speed along paths with bounded curvature
without reversing direction. For this version of the classic Traveling
Salesperson Problem, our algorithm closes the gap between previously
established lower and upper bounds; the achievable performance is of order
$n^{2/3}$."
"The expected path of an open system,which is a big Poincare system,has been
found in this paper.This path has been obtained from the actual and from the
expected droop of the open system.The actual droop has been reconstructed from
the variations in the power and in the frequency of the open system.The
expected droop has been found as a function of rotation from the expected
potential energy of the open system under synchronization of that system."
"In this paper we prove the conjecture of D\'{e}fago & Konagaya. Furthermore,
we describe a deterministic protocol for forming a regular n-gon in finite
time."
"In this paper we propose some novel path planning strategies for a double
integrator with bounded velocity and bounded control inputs. First, we study
the following version of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): given a set
of points in $\real^d$, find the fastest tour over the point set for a double
integrator. We first give asymptotic bounds on the time taken to complete such
a tour in the worst-case. Then, we study a stochastic version of the TSP for
double integrator where the points are randomly sampled from a uniform
distribution in a compact environment in $\real^2$ and $\real^3$. We propose
novel algorithms that perform within a constant factor of the optimal strategy
with high probability. Lastly, we study a dynamic TSP: given a stochastic
process that generates targets, is there a policy which guarantees that the
number of unvisited targets does not diverge over time? If such stable policies
exist, what is the minimum wait for a target? We propose novel stabilizing
receding-horizon algorithms whose performances are within a constant factor
from the optimum with high probability, in $\real^2$ as well as $\real^3$. We
also argue that these algorithms give identical performances for a particular
nonholonomic vehicle, Dubins vehicle."
"This paper presents a coordination algorithm for mobile autonomous robots.
Relying upon distributed sensing the robots achieve rendezvous, that is, they
move to a common location. Each robot is a point mass moving in a nonconvex
environment according to an omnidirectional kinematic model. Each robot is
equipped with line-of-sight limited-range sensors, i.e., a robot can measure
the relative position of any object (robots or environment boundary) if and
only if the object is within a given distance and there are no obstacles
in-between. The algorithm is designed using the notions of robust visibility,
connectivity-preserving constraint sets, and proximity graphs. Simulations
illustrate the theoretical results on the correctness of the proposed
algorithm, and its performance in asynchronous setups and with sensor
measurement and control errors."
"We describe the use of quasiperiodic oscillators for computation and control
of robots. We also describe their relationship to central pattern generators in
simple organisms and develop a group theory for describing the dynamics of
these systems."
"This paper presents a classification of generic 6-revolute jointed (6R)
manipulators using homotopy class of their critical point manifold. A part of
classification is listed in this paper because of the complexity of homotopy
class of 4-torus. The results of this classification will serve future research
of the classification and topological properties of maniplators joint space and
workspace."
"We derive a hybrid feedback control law for the lateral leg spring (LLS)
model so that the center of mass of a legged runner follows a curved path in
horizontal plane. The control law enables the runner to change the placement
and the elasticity of its legs to move in a desired direction. Stable motion
along a curved path is achieved using curvature, bearing and relative distance
between the runner and the curve as feedback. Constraints on leg parameters
determine the class of curves that can be followed. We also derive an optimal
control law that stabilizes the orientation of the runner's body relative to
the velocity of the runner's center of mass."
"We are given an equal number of mobile robotic agents, and distinct target
locations. Each agent has simple integrator dynamics, a limited communication
range, and knowledge of the position of every target. We address the problem of
designing a distributed algorithm that allows the group of agents to divide the
targets among themselves and, simultaneously, leads each agent to reach its
unique target. We do not require connectivity of the communication graph at any
time. We introduce a novel assignment-based algorithm with the following
features: initial assignments and robot motions follow a greedy rule, and
distributed refinements of the assignment exploit an implicit circular ordering
of the targets. We prove correctness of the algorithm, and give worst-case
asymptotic bounds on the time to complete the assignment as the environment
grows with the number of agents. We show that among a certain class of
distributed algorithms, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. The analysis
utilizes results on the Euclidean traveling salesperson problem."
"The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted
forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a relevant performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes."
"The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper.
Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common
translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby
reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier
is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based
on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable
performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of
force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii)
the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact
surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism,
characterized by the number of cams and their width."
"Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators.
One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian
matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain
conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error
amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced
elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of
points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic
manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being
currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only
manipulators with revolute joints are considered here."
"Presented in this paper is the kinematic analysis of a symmetrical
three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator. In opposite to serial
manipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse
kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This
property produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility
in trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of
aspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on
the notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse
kinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular
assembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel
manipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle."
"This work investigates new kinematic features of parallel manipulators. It is
well known that parallel manipulators admit generally several direct kinematic
solutions for a given set of input joint values. The aim of this paper is to
characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators,
as well as their image in the joint space. The study focuses on the most usual
case of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The
notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined
for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link
several solutions to the forward kinematic problem without meeting a
singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. An
additional set of surfaces, namely the characteristic surfaces, are
characterized which divide the workspace into basic regions and yield new
uniqueness domains. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR
planar parallel manipulator. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the
joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets."
"This paper focuses on the kinematic properties of a new
three-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator. This manipulator is obtained by
adding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by
Bajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the
two actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture
is hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel
manipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable
singularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]
and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic
arrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from
relatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is
intrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are
located on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In
addition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator
has the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of
the ""working mode"", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the
different structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic and
mechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybrid
manipulators."
"The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the
workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space.
The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is
redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible
to link several solutions to the direct kinematic problem without meeting a

Additional surfaces are characterized in the workspace which yield new
uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint
space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. This study is
illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator."
"This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining
applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed
parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform
which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main
interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the
popular PPP serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform
performances) as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links
(less inertia and better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well
suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the
orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated."
"The optimization of the pressure angle in a cam-follower transmission is
reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam
mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The
design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion from
a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. Two alternative design strategies
are studied, namely, (i) increase the number of lobes on each cam or (ii)
increase the number of cams. This device is intended to replace the current
ball-screws in Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot for the production of
translational motions, currently under development at Ecole Centrale de Nantes
for machining applications."
"The goal of this paper is to define the n-connected regions in the Cartesian
workspace of fully-parallel manipulators, i.e. the maximal regions where it is
possible to execute point-to-point motions. The manipulators considered in this
study may have multiple direct and inverse kinematic solutions. The N-connected
regions are characterized by projection, onto the Cartesian workspace, of the
connected components of the reachable configuration space defined in the
Cartesian product of the Cartesian space by the joint space. Generalized octree
models are used for the construction of all spaces. This study is illustrated
with a simple planar fully-parallel manipulator."
"Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which
means that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators
and joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such
architectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high
stiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit
the dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and
more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several
advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and
high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the
links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia
effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a
parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further
research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need
to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to
the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the
Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:
next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs
can be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented
existing PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool
prototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper."
"This article provides a formalism making it possible to manage the solutions
of the direct and inverse kinematic models of the fully parallel manipulators.
We introduce the concept of working modes to separate the solutions from the
opposite geometrical model. Then, we define, for each working mode, the aspects
of these manipulators. To separate the solutions from the direct kinematics
model, we introduce the concept of characteristic surfaces. Then, we define the
uniqueness domains, as being the greatest domains of the workspace in which
there is unicity of solutions. The principal applications of this work are the
design, the trajectory planning."
"Proposed in this paper is a kinetostatic performance index for the optimum
dimensioning of planar manipulators of the serial type. The index is based on
the concept of distance of the underlying Jacobian matrix to a given isotropic
matrix that is used as a reference model for purposes of performance
evaluation. Applications of the index fall in the realm of design, but control
applications are outlined. The paper focuses on planar manipulators, the basic
concepts being currently extended to their three-dimensional counterparts."
"The paper proposes a novel calibration approach for the Orthoglide-type
mechanisms based on observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during
motions between the prespecified test postures. It employs a low-cost measuring
system composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the universal
magnetic stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the deviation of the
relevant leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP along the Cartesian
axes. Using the measured differences, the developed algorithm estimates the
joint offsets that are treated as the most essential parameters to be adjusted.
The sensitivity of the measurement methods and the calibration accuracy are
also studied. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate validity of
the proposed calibration technique."
"The design of a novel prismatic drive is reported in this paper. This
transmission is based on Slide-O-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers
mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-O-Cam was
reported elsewhere. This drive thus provides pure-rolling motion, thereby
reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. Such properties
can be used to design new transmissions for parallel-kinematics machines. In
this paper, this transmission is optimized to replace ball-screws in
Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot optimized for machining applications."
"The paper proposes a novel approach for the geometrical model calibration of
quasi-isotropic parallel kinematic mechanisms of the Orthoglide family. It is
based on the observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during motions
between the specific test postures and employs a low-cost measuring system
composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the universal magnetic
stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the deviation of the relevant
leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP along the Cartesian axes.
Using the measured differences, the developed algorithm estimates the joint
offsets and the leg lengths that are treated as the most essential parameters.
Validity of the proposed calibration technique is confirmed by the experimental
results."
"The Orthoglide project aims at designing a new 3-axis machine tool for High
Speed Machining. Basis kinematics is a 3 degree-of-freedom translational
parallel mechanism. This basis was submitted to isotropic and manipulability
constraints that allowed the optmization of its kinematic architecture and legs
architecture. Thus, several leg morphologies are convenient for the chosen
mechanism. We explain the process that led us to the choice we made for the
Orthoglide. A static study is presented to show how singular configurations of
the legs can cause stiffness problems."
"The subject of this paper is a special class of parallel manipulators. First,
we analyze a family of three-degree-of-freedom manipulators. Two Jacobian
matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the joint-rate and the
Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ""inverse kinematics"" and the
""direct kinematics"" matrices. The singular configurations of these matrices are
studied. The isotropic configurations are then studied based on the
characteristic length of this manipulator. The isoconditioning loci of all
Jacobian matrices are computed to define a global performance index to compare
the different working modes."
"Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKM) are interesting alternative designs for
machine tools. A design method based on velocity amplification factors analysis
is presented in this paper. The comparative study of two simple
two-degree-of-freedom PKM dedicated to machining applications is led through
this method: the common desired properties are the largest square Cartesian
workspace for given kinetostatic performances. The orientation and position of
the Cartesian workspace are chosen to avoid singularities and to produce the
best ratio between Cartesian workspace size and mechanism size. The machine
size of each resulting design is used as a comparative criterion."
"The orthoglide is a 3-DOF parallel mechanism designed at IRCCyN for machining
applications. It features three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted
orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space
with fixed orientation. The orthoglide has been designed as function of a
prescribed Cartesian workspace with prescribed kinetostatic performances. The
interesting features of the orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape,
uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. A small-scale
prototype of the orthoglide under development is presented at the end of this
paper."
"This paper addresses the workspace analysis of the orthoglide, a 3-DOF
parallel mechanism designed for machining applications. This machine features
three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile
platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The
workspace analysis is conducted on the bases of prescribed kinetostatic
performances. The interesting features of the orthoglide are a regular
Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all directions and good
compactness. Interval analysis based methods for computing the dextrous
workspace and the largest cube enclosed in this workspace are presented."
"This paper presents the development of a new software in order to manage
objects, robots and mannequins in using the possibilities given by the haptic
feedback of the Phantom desktop devices. The haptic device provides 6
positional degree of freedom sensing but three degrees force feedback. This
software called eM-Virtual Desktop is integrated in the Tecnomatix's solution
called eM-Workplace. The eM-Workplace provides powerful solutions for planning
and designing of complex assembly facilities, lines and workplaces. In the
digital mockup context, the haptic interfaces can be used to reduce the
development cycle of products. Three different loops are used to manage the
graphic, the collision detection and the haptic feedback according to theirs
own frequencies. The developed software is currently tested in industrial
context by a European automotive constructor."
"The subject of this paper is the optimal design of a parallel mechanism
intended for three-axis machining applications. Parallel mechanisms are
interesting alternative designs in this context but most of them are designed
for three- or six-axis machining applications. In the last case, the position
and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the shape of the workspace is
complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with
two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translational motions and to add one leg to
have one-dof rotational motion. The kinematics and singular configurations are
studied as well as an optimization method. The three-degree-of-freedom
mechanisms analyzed in this paper can be extended to four-axis machines by
adding a fourth axis in series with the first two."
"The aim of this paper is to classify one family of 3R serial positioning
manipulators. This categorization is based on the number of cusp points of
quaternary, binary, generic and non-generic manipulators. It was found three
subsets of manipulators with 0, 2 or 4 cusp points and one homotopy class for
generic quaternary manipulators. This classification allows us to define the
design parameters for which the manipulator is cuspidal or not, i.e., for which
the manipulator can or cannot change posture without meeting a singularity,
respectively."
"The paper addresses kinematic and geometrical aspects of the Orthoglide, a
three-DOF parallel mechanism. This machine consists of three fixed linear
joints, which are mounted orthogonally, three identical legs and a mobile
platform, which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. New
solutions to solve inverse/direct kinematics are proposed and a detailed
workspace analysis is performed taking into account specific joint limit
constraints."
"The work presented in this paper is related to the use of a haptic device in
an environment of robotic simulation. Such device introduces a new approach to
feel and to understand the boundaries of the workspace of mechanisms as well as
its kinetostatic properties. Indeed, these concepts are abstract and thus often
difficult to understand for the end-users. To catch his attention, we propose
to amplify the problems of the mechanisms in order to help him to take the good
decisions."
"The subject of this paper is the design of a new concept of modular parallel
mechanisms for three, four or five-axis machining applications. Most parallel
mechanisms are designed for three- or six-axis machining applications. In the
last case, the position and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the
shape of the workspace is complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple
parallel mechanism with two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translation motions and
to add one or two legs to add one or two-dofs for rotation motions. The
kinematics and singular configurations are studied for each mechanism."
"A classification of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning manipulators is
established. This classification is based on the topology of their workspace.
The workspace is characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves
of the manipulator. The workspace topology is defined by the number of cusps
and nodes that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be partitioned into nine subspaces of distinct workspace topologies.
Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in the
DH-parameters."
"In this paper, a method to compute joint space singularity surfaces of 3-RPR
planar parallel manipulators is first presented. Then, a procedure to determine
maximal joint space singularity-free boxes is introduced. Numerical examples
are given in order to illustrate graphically the results. This study is of high
interest for planning trajectories in the joint space of 3-RPR parallel
manipulators and for manipulators design as it may constitute a tool for
choosing appropriate joint limits and thus for sizing the link lengths of the
manipulator."
"The paper derives the inverse and forward kinematic equations of a spatial
three-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism, which is the parallel module of a
hybrid serial-parallel 5-axis machine tool. This parallel mechanism consists of
a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three non-identical
legs. Each leg is made up of one prismatic and two pair spherical joint, which
are connected in a way that the combined effects of the three legs lead to an
over-constrained mechanism with complex motion. This motion is defined as a
simultaneous combination of rotation and translation."
"This paper presents an algorithm for detecting and computing the cusp points
in the joint space of 3-RPR planar parallel manipulators. In manipulator
kinematics, cusp points are special points, which appear on the singular curves
of the manipulators. The nonsingular change of assembly mode of 3-RPR parallel
manipulators was shown to be associated with the existence of cusp points. At
each of these points, three direct kinematic solutions coincide. In the
literature, a condition for the existence of three coincident direct kinematic
solutions was established, but has never been exploited, because the algebra
involved was too complicated to be solved. The algorithm presented in this
paper solves this equation and detects all the cusp points in the joint space
of these manipulators."
"This paper investigates the singular curves in two-dimensional slices of the
joint space of a family of planar parallel manipulators. It focuses on special
points, referred to as cusp points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp
points play an important role in the kinematic behavior of parallel
manipulators since they make possible a nonsingular change of assembly mode.
The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it reviews an important previous
work, which, to the authors' knowledge, has never been exploited yet. Second,
it determines the cusp points in any two-dimensional slice of the joint space.
First results show that the number of cusp points may vary from zero to eight.
This work finds applications in both design and trajectory planning."
"The paper discusses the kinematics of manipulators builts of planar closed
kinematic chains. A special kinematic scheme is extracted from the array of
these mechanisms that looks the most promising for the creation of different
types of robotic manipulators. The structural features of this manipulator
determine a number of its original properties that essentially simplify its
control. These features allow the main control problems to be effectively
overcome by application of the simple kinematic problems. The workspace and
singular configurations of a basic planar manipulator are studied. By using a
graphic simulation method, motions of the designed mechanism are examined. A
prototype of this mechanism was implemented to verify the proposed approach."
"The aim of this paper is to characterize the moveability of fully-parallel
manipulators in the presence of obstacles. Fully parallel manipulators are used
in applications where accuracy, stiffness or high speeds and accelerations are
required \cite{Merlet:97}. However, one of its main drawbacks is a relatively
small workspace compared to the one of serial manipulators. This is due mainly
to the existence of potential internal collisions, and the existence of
singularities. In this paper, the notion of free aspect is defined which
permits to exhibit domains of the workspace and the joint space free of
singularity and collision. The main application of this study is the
moveability analysis in the workspace of the manipulator as well as
path-planning, control and design."
"The aim of this paper is to characterize the notion of aspect in the
workspace and in the joint space for parallel manipulators. In opposite to the
serial manipulators, the parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple
inverse kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. The
notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86], and
redefined for parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution in
[Wenger 1997], is redefined for general fully parallel manipulators. Two
Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the joint-rate and
the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ""inverse kinematics"" and
the ""direct kinematics"" matrices. The study of these matrices allow to
respectively define the parallel and the serial singularities. The notion of
working modes is introduced to separate inverse kinematic solutions. Thus, we
can find out domains of the workspace and the joint space exempt of
singularity. Application of this study is the moveability analysis in the
workspace of the manipulator as well as path-planing and control. This study is
illustrated in this paper with a RR-RRR planar parallel manipulator."
"The subject of this paper is a special class of closed-chain manipulators.
First, we analyze a family of two-degree-of-freedom (dof) five-bar planar
linkages. Two Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the
joint-rate and the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ``inverse
kinematics"" and the ""direct kinematics"" matrices. It is shown that the loci of
points of the workspace where the condition number of the direct-kinematics
matrix remains constant, i.e., the isoconditioning loci, are the coupler points
of the four-bar linkage obtained upon locking the middle joint of the linkage.
Furthermore, if the line of centers of the two actuated revolutes is used as
the axis of a third actuated revolute, then a three-dof hybrid manipulator is
obtained. The isoconditioning loci of this manipulator are surfaces of
revolution generated by the isoconditioning curves of the two-dof manipulator,
whose axis of symmetry is that of the third actuated revolute."
"The goal of this paper is to explain, using a typical example, the
distribution of the different assembly modes in the workspace and their
effective role in the execution of trajectories. The singular and non-singular
changes of assembly mode are described and compared to each other. The
non-singular change of assembly mode is more deeply analysed and discussed in
the context of trajectory planning. In particular, it is shown that, according
to the location of the initial and final configurations with respect to the
uniqueness domains in the workspace, there are three different cases to
consider before planning a linking trajectory."
"The aim of this paper is the isotropic design of a hybrid morphology
dedicated to 3-axis machining applications. It is necessary to ensure the
feasibility of continuous, singularity-free trajectories, as well as a good
manipulability in position and velocity. We want to propose an alternative
design to conventional serial machine-tools. We compare a serial PPP
machine-tool (three prismatic orthogonal axes) with a hybrid architecture which
we optimize only the first two axes. The critrerion used for the optimization
is the conditioning of the Jacobian matrices. The optimum, namely isotropy, can
be obtained which provides our architecture with excellent manipulability
properties."
"This paper presents a new method, based on a multi-agent system and on
digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient path planner for a manikin
for access and visibility task under ergonomic constraints. In order to solve
this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process optimization to
contribute to a global perception of the environment. This operator cooperates,
in real-time, with several automatic local elementary agents. The result of
this work validates solutions brought by digital mock-up and that can be
applied to simulate maintenance task."
"In this article, we propose a method for calculation of the inverse and
direct dynamic models of the Orthoglide, a parallel robot with threedegrees of
freedom in translation. These models are calculated starting from the elements
of the dynamic model of the kinematic chain structure and equations of
Newton-Euler applied to the platform. These models are obtained in explicit
form having an interesting physical interpretation."
"This paper investigates two situations in which the forward kinematics of
planar 3-RPR parallel manipulators degenerates. These situations have not been
addressed before. The first degeneracy arises when the three input joint
variables r1, r2 and r3 satisfy a certain relationship. This degeneracy yields
a double root of the characteristic polynomial in t, which could be erroneously
interpreted as two coalesce assembly modes. But, unlike what arises in
non-degenerate cases, this double root yields two sets of solutions for the
position coordinates (x, y) of the platform. In the second situation, we show
that the forward kinematics degenerates over the whole joint space if the base
and platform triangles are congruent and the platform triangle is rotated by
180 deg about one of its sides. For these ""degenerate"" manipulators, which are
defined here for the first time, the forward kinematics is reduced to the
solution of a 3rd-degree polynomial and a quadratics in sequence. Such
manipulators constitute, in turn, a new family of analytic planar manipulators
that would be more suitable for industrial applications."
"The workspace topologies of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning
manipulators are enumerated. The workspace is characterized in a half-cross
section by the singular curves. The workspace topology is defined by the number
of cusps that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be divided into five domains where all manipulators have the same
number of cusps. Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in
the DH-parameters. As an application of this work, we provide a necessary and
sufficient condition for a 3R orthogonal manipulator to be cuspidal, i.e. to
change posture without meeting a singularity. This condition is set as an
explicit expression in the DH parameters."
"A spherical wrist of the serial type with n revolute (R) joints is said to be
isotropic if it can attain a posture whereby the singular values of its
Jacobian matrix are all equal to sqrt(n/3). What isotropy brings about is
robustness to manufacturing, assembly, and measurement errors, thereby
guaranteeing a maximum orientation accuracy. In this paper we investigate the
existence of redundant isotropic architectures, which should add to the
dexterity of the wrist under design by virtue of its extra degree of freedom.
The problem formulation, for, leads to a system of eight quadratic equations
with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of this system is thus 2^8=256, its BKK
bound being 192. However, the actual number of solutions is shown to be 32. We
list all solutions of the foregoing algebraic problem. All these solutions are
real, but distinct solutions do not necessarily lead to distinct manipulators.
Upon discarding those algebraic solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up
with exactly eight distinct architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators
being displayed at their isotropic postures."
"This paper proposes a method to calculate the largest Regular Dextrous
Workspace (RDW) of some types of three-revolute orthogonal manipulators that
have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. Then a new performance
index based on the RDW is introduced, the isocontours of this index are plotted
in the parameter space of the interesting types of manipulators and finally an
inspection of the domains of the parameter spaces is conducted in order to
identify the better manipulator architectures. The RDW is a part of the
workspace whose shape is regular (cube, cylinder) and the performances
(conditioning index) are bounded inside. The groups of 3R orthogonal
manipulators studied have interesting kinematic properties such as, a
well-connected workspace that is fully reachable with four inverse kinematic
solutions and that does not contain any void. This study is of high interest
for the design of alternative manipulator geometries."
"The design of a spherical wrist with parallel architecture is the object of
this article. This study is part of a larger project, which aims to design and
to build an eel robot for inspection of immersed piping. The kinematic analysis
of the mechanism is presented first to characterize the singular configurations
as well as the isotropic configurations. We add the design constraints related
to the application, such as (i) the compactness of the mechanism, (ii) the
symmetry of the elements in order to ensure static and dynamic balance and
(iii) the possibility of the mechanism to fill the elliptic form of the ell
sections."
"In the present paper, we introduce a new control architecture aimed at
driving virtual humans in interaction with virtual environments, by motion
capture. It brings decoupling of functionalities, and also of stability thanks
to passivity. We show projections can break passivity, and thus must be used
carefully. Our control scheme enables task space and internal control, contact,
and joint limits management. Thanks to passivity, it can be easily extended.
Besides, we introduce a new tool as for manikin's control, which makes it able
to build passive projections, so as to guide the virtual manikin when sharp
movements are needed."
"In order to optimize the costs and time of design of the new products while
improving their quality, concurrent engineering is based on the digital model
of these products, the numerical model. However, in order to be able to avoid
definitively physical model, old support of the design, without loss of
information, new tools must be available. Especially, a tool making it possible
to check simply and quickly the maintainability of complex mechanical sets
using the numerical model is necessary. Since one decade, our team works on the
creation of tool for the generation and the analysis of trajectories of virtual
mannequins. The simulation of human tasks can be carried out either by
robot-like simulation or by simulation by motion capture. This paper presents
some results on the both two methods. The first method is based on a
multi-agent system and on a digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient
path planner for a manikin or a robot for access and visibility task taking
into account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to
solve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process
optimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This
operator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary
agents. In the case of the second approach, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR
to solve the constraints related to the evolution of human virtual in its
environment on the basis of data resulting from motion capture system. An
approach using of the virtual guides was developed to allow to the user the
realization of precise trajectory in absence of force feedback. The result of
this work validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to
simulate maintenability and mountability tasks."
"The kinematic properties of mechanisms are well known by the researchers and
teachers. The theory based on the study of Jacobian matrices allows us to
explain, for example, the singular configuration. However, in many cases, the
physical sense of such properties is difficult to explain to students. The aim
of this article is to use haptic feedback to render to the user the
signification of different kinematic indices. The framework uses a Phantom Omni
and a serial and parallel mechanism with two degrees of freedom. The
end-effector of both mechanisms can be moved either by classical mouse, or
Phantom Omni with or without feedback."
"This paper addresses the workspace analysis of two 3-DOF translational
parallel mechanisms designed for machining applications. The two machines
features three fixed linear joints. The joint axes of the first machine are
orthogonal whereas these of the second are parallel. In both cases, the mobile
platform moves in the Cartesian $x-y-z$ space with fixed orientation. The
workspace analysis is conducted on the basis of prescribed kinetostatic
performances. Interval analysis based methods are used to compute the dextrous
workspace and the largest cube enclosed in this workspace."
"The research area ""Virtual Manufacturing (VM)'' is the use of information
technology and computer simulation to model real world manufacturing processes
for the purpose of analysing and understanding them. As automation technologies
such as CAD/CAM have substantially shortened the time required to design
products, Virtual Manufacturing will have a similar effect on the manufacturing
phase thanks to the modelling, simulation and optimisation of the product and
the processes involved in its fabrication. After a description of Virtual
Manufacturing (definitions and scope), we present some socio-economic factors
of VM and finaly some ""hot topics'' for the future are proposed."
"A classification of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positining manipulators is
established. This classification is based on the topology of their workspace.
The workspace is characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves.
The workspace topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear
on these singular curves. The design parameters space is shown to be divided
into nine domains of distinct workspace topologies, in which all manipulators
have similar global kinematic properties. Each separating surface is given as
an explicit expression in the DH-parameters."
"The Orthoglide is a Delta-type PKM dedicated to 3-axis rapid machining
applications that was originally developed at IRCCyN in 2000-2001 to meet the
advantages of both serial 3-axis machines (regular workspace and homogeneous
performances) and parallel kinematic architectures (good dynamic performances
and stiffness). This machine has three fixed parallel linear joints that are
mounted orthogonally. The geometric parameters of the Orthoglide were defined
as function of the size of a prescribed cubic Cartesian workspace that is free
of singularities and internal collision. The interesting features of the
Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all
directions and good compactness. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
analyze the stiffness of overconstrained Delta-type manipulators, such as the
Orthoglide. The Orthoglide is then benchmarked according to geometric,
kinematic and stiffness criteria: workspace to footprint ratio, velocity and
force transmission factors, sensitivity to geometric errors, torsional
stiffness and translational stiffness."
"This paper describes the workspace and the inverse and direct kinematic
analysis of the VERNE machine, a serial/parallel 5-axis machine tool designed
by Fatronik for IRCCyN. This machine is composed of a three-degree-of-freedom
(DOF) parallel module and a two-DOF serial tilting table. The parallel module
consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three
non-identical legs. This feature involves (i) a simultaneous combination of
rotation and translation for the moving platform, which is balanced by the
tilting table and (ii) workspace whose shape and volume vary as a function of
the tool length. This paper summarizes results obtained in the context of the
European projects NEXT (""Next Generation of Productions Systems"")."
"The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted
forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes."
"This paper is devoted to the kinematic design of a new six degree-of-freedom
haptic device using two parallel mechanisms. The first one, called orthoglide,
provides the translation motions and the second one, called agile eye, produces
the rotational motions. These two motions are decoupled to simplify the direct
and inverse kinematics, as it is needed for real-time control. To reduce the
inertial load, the motors are fixed on the base and a transmission with two
universal joints is used to transmit the rotational motions from the base to
the end-effector. Two alternative wrists are proposed (i), the agile eye with
three degrees of freedom or (ii) a hybrid wrist made by the assembly of a
two-dof agile eye with a rotary motor. The last one is optimized to increase
its stiffness and to decrease the number of moving parts."
"A family of 3R orthogonal manipulators without offset on the third body can
be divided into exactly nine workspace topologies. The workspace is
characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves. The workspace
topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear on these
singular curves. Based on this classification, we evaluate theses manipulators
by the condition number related to the joint space and the proportion of the
region with four inverse kinematic solutions compared to a sphere containing
all the workspace. This second performance number is in relation with the
workspace. We determine finally le topology of workspace to which belong
manipulators having the best performance number values."
"This paper analyses the workspace of the three-revolute orthogonal
manipulators that have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. These
manipulators are classified into different groups with similar kinematic
properties. The classification criteria are based on the topology of the
workspace. Each group is evaluated according to interesting kinematic
properties such as the size of the workspace subregion reachable with four
inverse kinematic solutions, the existence and the size of voids, and the size
of the regions of feasible paths in the workspace."
"The work presented here is aimed at introducing a virtual human controller in
a virtual prototyping framework. After a brief introduction describing the
problem solved in the paper, we describe the interest as for digital humans in
the context of concurrent engineering. This leads us to draw a control
architecture enabling to drive virtual humans in a real-time immersed way, and
to interact with the product, through motion capture. Unfortunately, we show
this control scheme can lead to unfeasible movements because of the lack of
balance control. Introducing such a controller is a problem that was never
addressed in the context of real-time. We propose an implementation of a
balance controller, that we insert into the previously described control
scheme. Next section is dedicated to show the results we obtained. Finally, we
propose a virtual reality platform into which the digital character controller
is integrated."
"The animation of human avatars seems very successful; the computer graphics
industry shows outstanding results in films everyday, the game industry
achieves exploits... Nevertheless, the animation and control processes of such
manikins are very painful. It takes days to a specialist to build such animated
sequences, and it is not adaptive to any type of modifications. Our main
purpose is the virtual human for engineering, especially virtual prototyping.
As for this domain of activity, such amounts of time are prohibitive."
"Manufacturing is using Virtual Reality tools to enhance the product life
cycle. Their definitions are still in flux and it is necessary to define their
connections. Thus, firstly, we will introduce more closely some definitions
where we will find that, if the Virtual manufacturing concepts originate from
machining operations and evolve in this manufacturing area, there exist a lot
of applications in different fields such as casting, forging, sheet
metalworking and robotics (mechanisms). From the recent projects in Europe or
in USA, we notice that the human perception or the simulation of mannequin is
more and more needed in both fields. In this context, we have isolated some
applications as ergonomic studies, assembly and maintenance simulation, design
or training where the virtual reality tools can be applied. Thus, we find out a
family of applications where the virtual reality tools give the engineers the
main role in the optimization process. We will illustrate our paper by several
examples where virtual reality interfaces are used and combined with
optimization tools as multi-agent systems."
"The aim of this paper is to present a new six degree-of-freedom (dof) haptic
device using two parallel mechanisms. The first one, called orthoglide,
provides the translation motions and the second one produces the rotational
motions. These two motions are decoupled to simplify the direct and inverse
kinematics, as it is needed for real-times control. To reduce the inertial
load, the motors are fixed on the base and a transmission with two universal
joints is used to transmit the rotational motions from the base to the
end-effector. The main feature of the orthoglide and of the agile eye mechanism
is the existence of an isotropic configuration. The length of the legs and the
range limits of the orthoglide are optimized to have homogeneous performance
throughout the Cartesian workspace, which has a nearly cubic workspace. These
properties permit to have a high stiffness throughout the workspace and
workspace limits that are easily understandable by the user."
"This article presents the Orthoglide project. The purpose of this project is
the realization of a prototype of machine tool to three degrees of translation.
The characteristic of this machine is a parallel kinematic architecture
optimized to obtain a compact workspace with homogeneous performance. For that,
the principal criterion of design which was used is the isotropy."
"Parallel kinematic mechanisms are interesting alternative designs for
machining applications. Three 2-DOF parallel mechanism architectures dedicated
to machining applications are studied in this paper. The three mechanisms have
two constant length struts gliding along fixed linear actuated joints with
different relative orientation. The comparative study is conducted on the basis
of a same prescribed Cartesian workspace for the three mechanisms. The common
desired workspace properties are a rectangular shape and given kinetostatic
performances. The machine size of each resulting design is used as a
comparative criterion. The 2-DOF machine mechanisms analyzed in this paper can
be extended to 3-axis machines by adding a third joint."
"This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining
applications: the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear
joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the
Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main interest of the
orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP
serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances) as
well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links (less inertia and
better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well suited to
high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to
5-axis machining is also investigated."
"A spherical wrist of the serial type is said to be isotropic if it can attain
a posture whereby the singular values of its Jacobian matrix are all identical
and nonzero. What isotropy brings about is robustness to manufacturing,
assembly, and measurement errors, thereby guaranteeing a maximum orientation
accuracy. In this paper we investigate the existence of redundant isotropic
architectures, which should add to the dexterity of the wrist under design by
virtue of its extra degree of freedom. The problem formulation leads to a
system of eight quadratic equations with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of
this system is thus 2^8 = 256, its BKK bound being 192. However, the actual
number of solutions is shown to be 32. We list all solutions of the foregoing
algebraic problem. All these solutions are real, but distinct solutions do not
necessarily lead to distinct manipulators. Upon discarding those algebraic
solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up with exactly eight distinct
architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators being displayed at their
isotropic posture."
"This paper addresses an interval analysis based study that is applied to the
design and the comparison of 3-DOF parallel kinematic machines. Two design
criteria are used, (i) a regular workspace shape and, (ii) a kinetostatic
performance index that needs to be as homogeneous as possible throughout the
workspace. The interval analysis based method takes these two criteria into
account: on the basis of prescribed kinetostatic performances, the workspace is
analysed to find out the largest regular dextrous workspace enclosed in the
Cartesian workspace. An algorithm describing this method is introduced. Two
3-DOF translational parallel mechanisms designed for machining applications are
compared using this method. The first machine features three fixed linear
joints which are mounted orthogonally and the second one features three linear
joints which are mounted in parallel. In both cases, the mobile platform moves
in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation."
"This paper addresses the architecture optimization of a 3-DOF translational
parallel mechanism designed for machining applications. The design optimization
is conducted on the basis of a prescribed Cartesian workspace with prescribed
kinetostatic performances. The resulting machine, the Orthoglide, features
three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile
platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The
interesting features of the Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape,
uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. A small-scale
prototype of the Orthoglide under development is presented at the end of this
paper."
"This paper presents a parametric stiffness analysis of the Orthoglide. A
compliant modeling and a symbolic expression of the stiffness matrix are
conducted. This allows a simple systematic analysis of the influence of the
geometric design parameters and to quickly identify the critical link
parameters. Our symbolic model is used to display the stiffest areas of the
workspace for a specific machining task. Our approach can be applied to any
parallel manipulator for which stiffness is a critical issue."
"The paper addresses kinematic and geometrical aspects of the Orthoglide, a
three-DOF parallel mechanism. This machine consists of three fixed linear
joints, which are mounted orthogonally, three identical legs and a mobile
platform, which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. New
solutions to solve inverse/direct kinematics are proposed and we perform a
detailed workspace and singularity analysis, taking into account specific joint
limit constraints."
"This paper presents a parametric stiffness analysis of the Orthoglide, a
3-DOF translational Parallel Kinematic Machine. First, a compliant modeling of
the Orthoglide is conducted based on an existing method. Then stiffness matrix
is symbolically computed. This allows one to easily study the influence of the
geometric design parameters on the matrix elements. Critical links are
displayed. Cutting forces are then modeled so that static displacements of the
Orthoglide tool during slot milling are symbolically computed. Influence of the
geometric design parameters on the static displacements is checked as well.
Other machining operations can be modeled. This parametric stiffness analysis
can be applied to any parallel manipulator for which stiffness is a critical
issue."
"The paper addresses the geometric synthesis of Orthoglide-type mechanism, a
family of 3-DOF parallel manipulators for rapid machining applications, which
combine advantages of both serial mechanisms and parallel kinematic
architectures. These manipulators possess quasi-isotropic kinematic
performances and are made up of three actuated fixed prismatic joints, which
are mutually orthogonal and connected to a mobile platform via three
parallelogram chains. The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed
orientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been
proposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link
lengths and actuated joint limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and
dextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors,
manipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic
stiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal
link length requirement. For each design strategy, analytical expressions for
computing the Orthoglide parameters are proposed. It is showed that the
proposed strategies yield Pareto-optimal solutions, which differ by the
kinematic performances outside the prescribed Cartesian cube (but within the
workspace bounded by the actuated joint limits). The proposed technique is
illustrated with numerical examples for the Orthoglide prototype design."
"This paper proposes a classification of three-revolute orthogonal
manipulators that have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. This
classification is based on the topology of their workspace. The workspace is
characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves. The workspace
topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear on these
singular curves. The manipulators are classified into different types with
similar kinematic properties. Each type is evaluated according to interesting
kinematic properties such as, whether the workspace is fully reachable with
four inverse kinematic solutions or not, the existence of voids, and the
feasibility of continuous trajectories in the workspace. It is found that
several orthogonal manipulators have a ""well-connected"" workspace, that is,
their workspace is fully accessible with four inverse kinematic solutions and
any continuous trajectory is feasible. This result is of interest for the
design of alternative manipulator geometries."
"The subject of this paper is a special class of three-degree-of-freedom
parallel manipulators. The singular configurations of the two Jacobian matrices
are first studied. The isotropic configurations are then found based on the
characteristic length of this manipulator. The isoconditioning loci for the
Jacobian matrices are plotted to define a global performance index allowing the
comparison of the different working modes. The index thus resulting is compared
with the Cartesian workspace surface and the average of the condition number."
"The aim of this paper is the kinematic study of a 3-RPR planar parallel
manipulator where the three fixed revolute joints are actuated. The direct and
inverse kinematic problem as well as the singular configuration is
characterized. On parallel singular configurations, the motion produce by the
mobile platform can be compared to the Reuleaux straight-line mechanism."
"This paper deals with the in-depth kinematic analysis of a special spherical
parallel wrist, called the Agile Eye. The Agile Eye is a three-legged spherical
parallel robot with revolute joints in which all pairs of adjacent joint axes
are orthogonal. Its most peculiar feature, demonstrated in this paper for the
first time, is that its (orientation) workspace is unlimited and flawed only by
six singularity curves (rather than surfaces). Furthermore, these curves
correspond to self-motions of the mobile platform. This paper also demonstrates
that, unlike for any other such complex spatial robots, the four solutions to
the direct kinematics of the Agile Eye (assembly modes) have a simple geometric
relationship with the eight solutions to the inverse kinematics (working
modes)."
"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of the Orthoglide, a 3-DOF
translational Parallel Kinematic Machine. Two complementary methods are
developed to analyze its sensitivity to its dimensional and angular variations.
First, a linkage kinematic analysis method is used to have a rough idea of the
influence of the dimensional variations on the location of the end-effector.
Besides, this method shows that variations in the design parameters of the same
type from one leg to the other have the same influence on the end-effector.
However, this method does not take into account the variations in the
parallelograms. Thus, a differential vector method is used to study the
influence of the dimensional and angular variations in the parts of the
manipulator on the position and orientation of the end-effector, and
particularly the influence of the variations in the parallelograms. It turns
out that the kinematic isotropic configuration of the manipulator is the least
sensitive one to its dimensional and angular variations. On the contrary, the
closest configurations to its kinematic singular configurations are the most
sensitive ones to geometrical variations."
"We introduce our concept on the modular wireless robot consisting of three
main modules : main unit, data acquisition and data processing modules. We have
developed a generic prototype with an integrated control and monitoring system
to enhance its flexibility, and to enable simple operation through a web-based
interface accessible wirelessly. In present paper, we focus on the
microcontroller based hardware to enable data acquisition and remote mechanical
control."
"This paper investigates the singular curves in the joint space of a family of
planar parallel manipulators. It focuses on special points, referred to as cusp
points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp points play an important role in
the kinematic behavior of parallel manipulators since they make possible a
nonsingular change of assembly mode. The purpose of this study is twofold.
First, it exposes a method to compute joint space singular curves of 3-RPR
planar parallel manipulators. Second, it presents an algorithm for detecting
and computing all cusp points in the joint space of these same manipulators."
"The paper proposes a novel calibration approach for the Orthoglide-type
mechanisms based on observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during
mo-tions between the prespecified test postures. It employs a low-cost
measuring system composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the
universal magnetic stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the
deviation of the relevant leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP
along the Cartesian axes. Using the measured differences, the developed
algorithm estimates the joint offsets that are treated as the most essential
parameters to be adjusted. The sensitivity of the meas-urement methods and the
calibration accuracy are also studied. Experimental re-sults are presented that
demonstrate validity of the proposed calibration technique"
"In this paper, our focus is on certain applications for mobile robotic
networks, where reconfiguration is driven by factors intrinsic to the network
rather than changes in the external environment. In particular, we study a
version of the coverage problem useful for surveillance applications, where the
objective is to position the robots in order to minimize the average distance
from a random point in a given environment to the closest robot. This problem
has been well-studied for omni-directional robots and it is shown that optimal
configuration for the network is a centroidal Voronoi configuration and that
the coverage cost belongs to $\Theta(m^{-1/2})$, where $m$ is the number of
robots in the network. In this paper, we study this problem for more realistic
models of robots, namely the double integrator (DI) model and the differential
drive (DD) model. We observe that the introduction of these motion constraints
in the algorithm design problem gives rise to an interesting behavior. For a
\emph{sparser} network, the optimal algorithm for these models of robots mimics
that for omni-directional robots. We propose novel algorithms whose
performances are within a constant factor of the optimal asymptotically (i.e.,
as $m \to +\infty$). In particular, we prove that the coverage cost for the DI
and DD models of robots is of order $m^{-1/3}$. Additionally, we show that, as
the network grows, these novel algorithms outperform the conventional
algorithm; hence necessitating a reconfiguration in the network in order to
maintain optimal quality of service."
"This article presents the design of the autonomous humanoid robot called NAO
that is built by the French company Aldebaran-Robotics. With its height of 0.57
m and its weight about 4.5 kg, this innovative robot is lightweight and
compact. It distinguishes itself from its existing Japanese, American, and
other counterparts thanks to its pelvis kinematics design, its proprietary
actuation system based on brush DC motors, its electronic, computer and
distributed software architectures. This robot has been designed to be
affordable without sacrificing quality and performance. It is an open and
easy-to-handle platform where the user can change all the embedded system
software or just add some applications to make the robot adopt specific
behaviours. The robot's head and forearms are modular and can be changed to
promote further evolution. The comprehensive and functional design is one of
the reasons that helped select NAO to replace the AIBO quadrupeds in the 2008
RoboCup standard league."
"We present here the results of an analysis carried out by biologists and
roboticists with the aim of modeling bird locomotion kinematics for robotics
purposes. The aim was to develop a bio-inspired kinematic model of the bird leg
from biological data. We first acquired and processed kinematic data for
sagittal and top views obtained by X-ray radiography of quails walking. Data
processing involved filtering and specific data reconstruction in three
dimensions, as two-dimensional views cannot be synchronized. We then designed a
robotic model of a bird-like leg based on a kinematic analysis of the
biological data. Angular velocity vectors were calculated to define the number
of degrees of freedom (DOF) at each joint and the orientation of the rotation
axes."
"Avoider robot is mean robot who is designed to avoid the block in around.
Except that, this robot is also added by an addition application to dim the
fire. This robot is made with ultrasonic sensor PING. This sensor is set on the
front, right and left from robot. This sensor is used robot to look for the
right street, so that robot can walk on. After the robot can look for the right

next, dim the fire with fan. This robot is made with basic stamp 2
micro-controller. And that micro-controller can be found in dt-basic mini
system module. This robot is made with servo motor on the right and left side,
which is used to movement."
"This paper deals with a new planar parallel mechanism with variable actuation
and its kinetostatic performance. A drawback of parallel mechanisms is the non
homogeneity of kinetostatic performance within their workspace. The common
approach to solve this problem is the introduction of actuation redundancy,
that involves force control algorithms. Another approach, highlighted in this
paper, is to select the actuated joint in each limb with regard to the pose of
the end-effector. First, the architecture of the mechanism and two kinetostatic
performance indices are described. Then, the actuating modes of the mechanism
are compared."
"This paper deals with the kinematic and dynamic analyses of the Orthoglide
5-axis, a five-degree-of-freedom manipulator. It is derived from two
manipulators: i) the Orthoglide 3-axis; a three dof translational manipulator
and ii) the Agile eye; a parallel spherical wrist. First, the kinematic and
dynamic models of the Orthoglide 5-axis are developed. The geometric and
inertial parameters of the manipulator are determined by means of a CAD
software. Then, the required motors performances are evaluated for some test
trajectories. Finally, the motors are selected in the catalogue from the
previous results."
"This paper characterizes geometrically the singularities of limited DOF
parallel manipulators. The geometric conditions associated with the dependency
of six Pl\""ucker vector of lines (finite and infinite) constituting the rows of
the inverse Jacobian matrix are formulated using Grassmann-Cayley algebra.
Manipulators under consideration do not need to have a passive spherical joint
somewhere in each leg. This study is illustrated with three example robots"
"Muscle fatigue is defined as the point at which the muscle is no longer able
to sustain the required force or work output level. The overexertion of muscle
force and muscle fatigue can induce acute pain and chronic pain in human body.
When muscle fatigue is accumulated, the functional disability can be resulted
as musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). There are several posture exposure analysis
methods useful for rating the MSD risks, but they are mainly based on static
postures. Even in some fatigue evaluation methods, muscle fatigue evaluation is
only available for static postures, but not suitable for dynamic working
process. Meanwhile, some existing muscle fatigue models based on physiological
models cannot be easily used in industrial ergonomic evaluations. The external
dynamic load is definitely the most important factor resulting muscle fatigue,
thus we propose a new fatigue model under a framework for evaluating fatigue in
dynamic working processes. Under this framework, virtual reality system is
taken to generate virtual working environment, which can be interacted with the
work with haptic interfaces and optical motion capture system. The motion
information and load information are collected and further processed to
evaluate the overall work load of the worker based on dynamic muscle fatigue
models and other work evaluation criterions and to give new information to
characterize the penibility of the task in design process."
"This paper presents SinguLab, a graphical user interface for the singularity
analysis of parallel robots. The algorithm is based on Grassmann-Cayley
algebra. The proposed tool is interactive and introduces the designer to the
singularity analysis performed by this method, showing all the stages along the
procedure and eventually showing the solution algebraically and graphically,
allowing as well the singularity verification of different robot poses."
"This paper demonstrates that any general 3-DOF three-legged planar parallel
robot with extensible legs can change assembly modes without passing through
parallel singularities (configurations where the mobile platform loses its
stiffness). While the results are purely theoretical, this paper questions the
very definition of parallel singularities."
"In order to optimise the costs and time of design of the new products while
improving their quality, concurrent engineering is based on the digital model
of these products. However, in order to be able to avoid definitively physical
model without loss of information, new tools must be available. Especially, a
tool making it possible to check simply and quickly the maintainability of
complex mechanical sets using the numerical model is necessary. Since one
decade, the MCM team of IRCCyN works on the creation of tools for the
generation and the analysis of trajectories of virtual mannequins. The
simulation of human tasks can be carried out either by robot-like simulation or
by simulation by motion capture. This paper presents some results on the both
two methods. The first method is based on a multi-agent system and on a digital
mock-up technology, to assess an efficient path planner for a manikin or a
robot for access and visibility task taking into account ergonomic constraints
or joint limits. The human operator is integrated in the process optimisation
to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This operator
cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary agents. In
the second method, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR to solve the constraints
related to the evolution of human virtual in its environment on the basis of
data resulting from motion capture system. An approach using of the virtual
guides was developed to allow to the user the realization of precise trajectory
in absence of force feedback."
"In this paper, a novel approach for parallel kinematic machine control
relying on a fast exteroceptive measure is implemented and validated on the
Orthoglide robot. This approach begins with rewriting the robot models as a
function of the only end-effector pose. It is shown that such an operation
reduces the model complexity. Then, this approach uses a classical Cartesian
space computed torque control with a fast exteroceptive measure, reducing the
control schemes complexity. Simulation results are given to show the expected
performance improvements and experiments prove the practical feasibility of the
approach."
"The paper presents a new stiffness modelling method for overconstrained
parallel manipulators, which is applied to 3-d.o.f. translational mechanisms.
It is based on a multidimensional lumped-parameter model that replaces the link
flexibility by localized 6-d.o.f. virtual springs. In contrast to other works,
the method includes a FEA-based link stiffness evaluation and employs a new
solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations, which allows computing the
stiffness matrix for the overconstrained architectures and for the singular
manipulator postures. The advantages of the developed technique are confirmed
by application examples, which deal with comparative stiffness analysis of two
translational parallel manipulators."
"The paper derives the inverse and the forward kinematic equations of a serial
- parallel 5-axis machine tool: the VERNE machine. This machine is composed of
a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel module and a two-DOF serial tilting
table. The parallel module consists of a moving platform that is connected to a
fixed base by three non-identical legs. These legs are connected in a way that
the combined effects of the three legs lead to an over-constrained mechanism
with complex motion. This motion is defined as a simultaneous combination of
rotation and translation. In this paper we propose symbolical methods that able
to calculate all kinematic solutions and identify the acceptable one by adding
analytical constraint on the disposition of legs of the parallel module."
"Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is one of the major health problems in
mechanical work especially in manual handling jobs. Muscle fatigue is believed
to be the main reason for MSD. Posture analysis techniques have been used to
expose MSD risks of the work, but most of the conventional methods are only
suitable for static posture analysis. Meanwhile the subjective influences from
the inspectors can result differences in the risk assessment. Another
disadvantage is that the evaluation has to be taken place in the workshop, so
it is impossible to avoid some design defects before data collection in the
field environment and it is time consuming. In order to enhance the efficiency
of ergonomic MSD risk evaluation and avoid subjective influences, we develop a
new muscle fatigue model and a new fatigue index to evaluate the human muscle
fatigue during manual handling jobs in this paper. Our new fatigue model is
closely related to the muscle load during working procedure so that it can be
used to evaluate the dynamic working process. This muscle fatigue model is
mathematically validated and it is to be further experimental validated and
integrated into a virtual working environment to evaluate the muscle fatigue
and predict the MSD risks quickly and objectively."
"Although automatic techniques have been employed in manufacturing industries
to increase productivity and efficiency, there are still lots of manual
handling jobs, especially for assembly and maintenance jobs. In these jobs,
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the major health problems due to
overload and cumulative physical fatigue. With combination of conventional
posture analysis techniques, digital human modelling and simulation (DHM)
techniques have been developed and commercialized to evaluate the potential
physical exposures. However, those ergonomics analysis tools are mainly based
on posture analysis techniques, and until now there is still no fatigue index
available in the commercial software to evaluate the physical fatigue easily
and quickly. In this paper, a new muscle fatigue and recovery model is proposed
and extended to evaluate joint fatigue level in manual handling jobs. A special
application case is described and analyzed by digital human simulation
technique."
"This paper discusses the utility of using simple stiffness and vibrations
models, based on the Jacobian matrix of a manipulator and only the rigidity of
the actuators, whenever its geometry is optimised. In many works, these
simplified models are used to propose optimal design of robots. However, the
elasticity of the drive system is often negligible in comparison with the
elasticity of the elements, especially in applications where high dynamic
performances are needed. Therefore, the use of such a simplified model may lead
to the creation of robots with long legs, which will be submitted to large
bending and twisting deformations. This paper presents an example of
manipulator for which it is preferable to use a complete stiffness or vibration
model to obtain the most suitable design and shows that the use of simplified
models can lead to mechanisms with poorer rigidity."
"A class of analytic planar 3-RPR manipulators is analyzed in this paper.
These manipulators have congruent base and moving platforms and the moving
platform is rotated of 180 deg about an axis in the plane. The forward
kinematics is reduced to the solution of a 3rd-degree polynomial and a
quadratic equation in sequence. The singularities are calculated and plotted in
the joint space. The second-order singularities (cups points), which play an
important role in non-singular change of assembly-mode motions, are also
analyzed."
"The paper focuses on the accuracy improvement of stiffness models for
parallel manipulators, which are employed in high-speed precision machining. It
is based on the integrated methodology that combines analytical and numerical
techniques and deals with multidimensional lumped-parameter models of the
links. The latter replace the link flexibility by localized 6-dof virtual
springs describing both translational/rotational compliance and the coupling
between them. There is presented detailed accuracy analysis of the stiffness
identification procedures employed in the commercial CAD systems (including
statistical analysis of round-off errors, evaluating the confidence intervals
for stiffness matrices). The efficiency of the developed technique is confirmed
by application examples, which deal with stiffness analysis of translational
parallel manipulators."
"The paper proposes an integrated approach to the design optimization of
parallel manipulators, which is based on the concept of the workspace grid and
utilizes the goal-attainment formulation for the global optimization. To
combine the non-homogenous design specification, the developed optimization
technique transforms all constraints and objectives into similar performance
indices related to the maximum size of the prescribed shape workspace. This
transformation is based on the dedicated dynamic programming procedures that
satisfy computational requirements of modern CAD. Efficiency of the developed
technique is demonstrated via two case studies that deal with optimization of
the kinematical and stiffness performances for parallel manipulators of the
Orthoglide family."
"In this paper we describe a new robotic brachytherapy needle-insertion system
that is designed to replace the template used in the manual technique. After a
brief review of existing robotic systems, we describe the requirements that we
based our design upon. A detailed description of the proposed system follows.
Our design is capable of positioning and inclining a needle within the same
workspace as the manual template. To help improve accuracy, the needle can be
rotated about its axis during insertion into the prostate. The system can be
mounted on existing steppers and also easily accommodates existing seed
dispensers, such as the Mick Applicator."
"The paper proposes a new calibration method for parallel manipulators that
allows efficient identification of the joint offsets using observations of the
manipulator leg parallelism with respect to the base surface. The method
employs a simple and low-cost measuring system, which evaluates deviation of
the leg location during motions that are assumed to preserve the leg
parallelism for the nominal values of the manipulator parameters. Using the
measured deviations, the developed algorithm estimates the joint offsets that
are treated as the most essential parameters to be identified. The validity of
the proposed calibration method and efficiency of the developed numerical
algorithms are confirmed by experimental results. The sensitivity of the
measurement methods and the calibration accuracy are also studied."
"The paper presents a new stiffness modelling method for multi-chain parallel
robotic manipulators with flexible links and compliant actuating joints. In
contrast to other works, the method involves a FEA-based link stiffness
evaluation and employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations,
which allows computing the stiffness matrix for singular postures and to take
into account influence of the external forces. The advantages of the developed
technique are confirmed by application examples, which deal with stiffness
analysis of a parallel manipulator of the Orthoglide family"
"Automation technique has been widely used in manufacturing industry, but
there are still manual handling operations required in assembly and maintenance
work in industry. Inappropriate posture and physical fatigue might result in
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in such physical jobs. In ergonomics and
occupational biomechanics, virtual human modelling techniques have been
employed to design and optimize the manual operations in design stage so as to
avoid or decrease potential MSD risks. In these methods, physical fatigue is
only considered as minimizing the muscle or joint stress, and the fatigue
effect along time for the posture is not considered enough. In this study,
based on the existing methods and multiple objective optimisation method (MOO),
a new posture prediction and analysis method is proposed for predicting the
optimal posture and evaluating the physical fatigue in the manual handling
operation. The posture prediction and analysis problem is mathematically
described and a special application case is demonstrated for analyzing a
drilling assembly operation in European Aeronautic Defence & Space Company
(EADS) in this paper."
"The paper focuses on the enhanced stiffness modeling of robotic manipulators
by taking into account influence of the external force/torque acting upon the
end point. It implements the virtual joint technique that describes the
compliance of manipulator elements by a set of localized six-dimensional
springs separated by rigid links and perfect joints. In contrast to the
conventional formulation, which is valid for the unloaded mode and small
displacements, the proposed approach implicitly assumes that the loading leads
to the non-negligible changes of the manipulator posture and corresponding
amendment of the Jacobian. The developed numerical technique allows computing
the static equilibrium and relevant force/torque reaction of the manipulator
for any given displacement of the end-effector. This enables designer detecting
essentially nonlinear effects in elastic behavior of manipulator, similar to
the buckling of beam elements. It is also proposed the linearization procedure
that is based on the inversion of the dedicated matrix composed of the
stiffness parameters of the virtual springs and the Jacobians/Hessians of the
active and passive joints. The developed technique is illustrated by an
application example that deals with the stiffness analysis of a parallel
manipulator of the Orthoglide family."
"Series Elastic Actuators provide many benefits in force control of robots in
unconstrained environments. These benefits include high force fidelity,
extremely low impedance, low friction, and good force control bandwidth. Series
Elastic Actuators employ a novel mechanical design architecture which goes
against the common machine design principal of ""stiffer is better"". A compliant
element is placed between the gear train and driven load to intentionally
reduce the stiffness of the actuator. A position sensor measures the
deflection, and the force output is accurately calculated using Hooke's Law
(F=Kx). A control loop then servos the actuator to the desired output force.
The resulting actuator has inherent shock tolerance, high force fidelity and
extremely low impedance. These characteristics are desirable in many
applications including legged robots, exoskeletons for human performance
amplification, robotic arms, haptic interfaces, and adaptive suspensions. We
describe several variations of Series Elastic Actuators that have been
developed using both electric and hydraulic components."
"This article synthezises the most important results on the kinematics of
cuspidal manipulators i.e. nonredundant manipulators that can change posture
without meeting a singularity. The characteristic surfaces, the uniqueness
domains and the regions of feasible paths in the workspace are defined. Then,
several sufficient geometric conditions for a manipulator to be noncuspidal are
enumerated and a general necessary and sufficient condition for a manipulator
to be cuspidal is provided. An explicit DH-parameter-based condition for an
orthogonal manipulator to be cuspidal is derived. The full classification of 3R
orthogonal manipulators is provided and all types of cuspidal and noncuspidal
orthogonal manipulators are enumerated. Finally, some facts about cuspidal and
noncuspidal 6R manipulators are reported."
"The paper presents the position analysis of a spatial structure composed of
two platforms mutually connected by one RRP and three SS serial kinematic
chains, where R, P, and S stand for revolute, prismatic, and spherical
kinematic pair respectively. A set of three compatibility equations is laid
down that, following algebraic elimination, results in a 28th-order univariate
algebraic equation, which in turn provides the addressed problem with 28
solutions in the complex domain. Among the applications of the results
presented in this paper is the solution to the forward kinematics of the
Tricept, a well-known in-parallel-actuated spatial manipulator. Numerical
examples show adoption of the proposed method in dealing with two case studies."
"This paper presents three feedback controllers that achieve an asymptotically
stable, periodic, and fast walking gait for a 3D (spatial) bipedal robot
consisting of a torso, two legs, and passive (unactuated) point feet. The
contact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw
rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and 6
actuators. The interest of studying robots with point feet is that the robot's
natural dynamics must be explicitly taken into account to achieve balance while
walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid
zero dynamics, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an
autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit. This method allows the
computations to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model.
The stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with
the linearization of the restricted Poincar\'e map of the hybrid zero dynamics.
Three strategies are explored. The first strategy consists of imposing a
stability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The
second strategy uses an event-based controller. In the third approach, the
effect of output selection is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is
proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental
event-based controller."
"FastSLAM is a framework for simultaneous localization using a
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. In FastSLAM, particle filter is used for the
mobile robot pose (position and orientation) estimation, and an Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) is used for the feature location's estimation. However, FastSLAM
degenerates over time. This degeneracy is due to the fact that a particle set
estimating the pose of the robot loses its diversity. One of the main reasons
for loosing particle diversity in FastSLAM is sample impoverishment. It occurs
when likelihood lies in the tail of the proposal distribution. In this case,
most of particle weights are insignificant. Another problem of FastSLAM relates
to the design of an extended Kalman filter for landmark position's estimation.
The performance of the EKF and the quality of the estimation depends heavily on
correct a priori knowledge of the process and measurement noise covariance
matrices (Q and R) that are in most applications unknown. On the other hand, an
incorrect a priori knowledge of Q and R may seriously degrade the performance
of the Kalman filter. This paper presents a Neuro-Fuzzy Multi Swarm FastSLAM
Framework. In our proposed method, a Neuro-Fuzzy extended kalman filter for
landmark feature estimation, and a particle filter based on particle swarm
optimization are presented to overcome the impoverishment of FastSLAM.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
"During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning
algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been shown
to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as
probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of
the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The
first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under
mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges
almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered,
called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost
of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a
tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT$^*$ algorithm, which
preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure
like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections
between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random
geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the
number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT$^*$ algorithms is
asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT."
"We investigate several coordinate systems and dynamical vector fields for
target tracking to be used in driver assistance systems. We show how to express
the discrete dynamics of maneuvering target vehicles in arbitrary coordinates
starting from the target's and the own (ego) vehicle's assumed dynamical model
in global coordinates. We clarify the notion of ""ego compensation"" and show how
non-inertial effects are to be included when using a body-fixed coordinate
system for target tracking. We finally compare the tracking error of different
combinations of target tracking coordinates and dynamical vector fields for
simulated data."
"An accurate motion model is an important component in modern-day robotic
systems, but building such a model for a complex system often requires an
appreciable amount of manual effort. In this paper we present a motion model
representation, the Dynamic Gaussian Mixture Model (DGMM), that alleviates the
need to manually design the form of a motion model, and provides a direct means
of incorporating auxiliary sensory data into the model. This representation and
its accompanying algorithms are validated experimentally using an 8-legged
kinematically complex robot, as well as a standard benchmark dataset. The
presented method not only learns the robot's motion model, but also improves
the model's accuracy by incorporating information about the terrain surrounding
the robot."
"In this paper, a simple Neural controller has been used to achieve stable
walking in a NAO biped robot, with 22 degrees of freedom that implemented in a
virtual physics-based simulation environment of Robocup soccer simulation
environment. The algorithm uses a Matsuoka base neural oscillator to generate
control signal for the biped robot. To find the best angular trajectory and
optimize network parameters, a new population-based search algorithm, called
the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, has been used. The algorithm conceptualized
a group of musicians together trying to search for better state of harmony.
Simulation results demonstrate that the modification of the step period and the
walking motion due to the sensory feedback signals improves the stability of
the walking motion."
"This paper is concerned with designing self-driven fitness functions for
Embedded Evolutionary Robotics. The proposed approach considers the entropy of
the sensori-motor stream generated by the robot controller. This entropy is
computed using unsupervised learning; its maximization, achieved by an on-board
evolutionary algorithm, implements a ""curiosity instinct"", favouring
controllers visiting many diverse sensori-motor states (sms). Further, the set
of sms discovered by an individual can be transmitted to its offspring, making
a cultural evolution mode possible. Cumulative entropy (computed from ancestors
and current individual visits to the sms) defines another self-driven fitness;
its optimization implements a ""discovery instinct"", as it favours controllers
visiting new or rare sensori-motor states. Empirical results on the benchmark
problems proposed by Lehman and Stanley (2008) comparatively demonstrate the
merits of the approach."
"Due to the flexibility and adaptability of human, manual handling work is
still very important in industry, especially for assembly and maintenance work.
Well-designed work operation can improve work efficiency and quality; enhance
safety, and lower cost. Most traditional methods for work system analysis need
physical mock-up and are time consuming. Digital mockup (DMU) and digital human
modeling (DHM) techniques have been developed to assist ergonomic design and
evaluation for a specific worker population (e.g. 95 percentile); however, the
operation adaptability and adjustability for a specific individual are not
considered enough. In this study, a new framework based on motion tracking
technique and digital human simulation technique is proposed for motion-time
analysis of manual operations. A motion tracking system is used to track a
worker's operation while he/she is conducting a manual handling work. The
motion data is transferred to a simulation computer for real time digital human
simulation. The data is also used for motion type recognition and analysis
either online or offline for objective work efficiency evaluation and
subjective work task evaluation. Methods for automatic motion recognition and
analysis are presented. Constraints and limitations of the proposed method are
discussed."
"Virtual human techniques have been used a lot in industrial design in order
to consider human factors and ergonomics as early as possible. The physical
status (the physical capacity of virtual human) has been mostly treated as
invariable in the current available human simulation tools, while indeed the
physical capacity varies along time in an operation and the change of the
physical capacity depends on the history of the work as well. Virtual Human
Status is proposed in this paper in order to assess the difficulty of manual
handling operations, especially from the physical perspective. The decrease of
the physical capacity before and after an operation is used as an index to
indicate the work difficulty. The reduction of physical strength is simulated
in a theoretical approach on the basis of a fatigue model in which fatigue
resistances of different muscle groups were regressed from 24 existing maximum
endurance time (MET) models. A framework based on digital human modeling
technique is established to realize the comparison of physical status. An
assembly case in airplane assembly is simulated and analyzed under the
framework. The endurance time and the decrease of the joint moment strengths
are simulated. The experimental result in simulated operations under laboratory
conditions confirms the feasibility of the theoretical approach."
"Most cognitive architectures rely on discrete representation, both in space
(e.g., objects) and in time (e.g., events). However, a robot interaction with
the world is inherently continuous, both in space and in time. The segmentation
of the stream of perceptual inputs a robot receives into discrete and
meaningful events poses as a challenge in bridging the gap between internal
cognitive representations, and the external world. Event Segmentation Theory,
recently proposed in the context of cognitive systems research, sustains that
humans segment time into events based on matching perceptual input with
predictions. In this work we propose a framework for online event segmentation,
targeting robots endowed with active perception. Moreover, sensory processing
systems have an intrinsic latency, resulting from many factors such as sampling
rate, and computational processing, and which is seldom accounted for. This
framework is founded on the theory of dynamical systems synchronization, where
the system considered includes both the robot and the world coupled (strong
anticipation). An adaption rule is used to perform simultaneous system
identification and synchronization, and anticipating synchronization is
employed to predict the short-term system evolution. This prediction allows for
an appropriate control of the robot actuation. Event boundaries are detected
once synchronization is lost (sudden increase of the prediction error). An
experimental proof of concept of the proposed framework is presented, together
with some preliminary results corroborating the approach."
"Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of
the inverse dynamic model, which is linear with respect to the dynamic
parameters. This model is sampled while the robot is tracking reference
trajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear
least-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. The efficiency of this
method has been proved through the experimental identification of many
prototypes and industrial robots. However, this method requires the joint
force/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity
and acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high
sampling rates. The proposed new method requires only the joint force/torque
measurement. It is a closed-loop output error method where the usual joint
position output is replaced by the joint force/torque. It is based on a
closed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same
structure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the
actual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of
the error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. This
is a non-linear least-squares problem which is dramatically simplified using
the inverse dynamic model to obtain an analytical expression of the simulated
force/torque, linear in the parameters. A validation experiment on a 2
degree-of-freedom direct drive robot shows that the new method is efficient."
"Sampling-based motion planners are an effective means for generating
collision-free motion paths. However, the quality of these motion paths, with
respect to different quality measures such as path length, clearance,
smoothness or energy, is often notoriously low. This problem is accentuated in
the case of non-holonomic sampling-based motion planning, in which the space of
feasible motion trajectories is restricted. In this study, we combine the C-PRM
algorithm by Song and Amato with our recently introduced path-hybridization
approach, for creating high quality non-holonomic motion paths, with
combinations of several different quality measures such as path length,
smoothness or clearance, as well as the number of reverse car motions. Our
implementation includes a variety of code optimizations that result in nearly
real-time performance, and which we believe can be extended with further
optimizations to a real-time tool for the planning of high-quality car-like
motion."
"Engineering the software development process in robotics is one of the basic
necessities towards industrial-strength service robotic systems. A major
challenge is to make the step from code-driven to model-driven systems. This is
essential to replace hand-crafted single-unit systems by systems composed out
of components with explicitly stated properties. Furthermore, this fosters
reuse by separating robotics knowledge from short-cycled implementational
technologies. Altogether, this is one but important step towards ""able"" robots.
This paper reports on a model-driven development process for robotic systems.
The process consists of a robotics metamodel with first explications of
non-functional properties. A model-driven toolchain based on Eclipse provides
the model transformation and code generation steps. It also provides design
time analysis of resource parameters (e.g. schedulability analysis of realtime
tasks) as a first step towards overall resource awareness in the development of
integrated robotic systems. The overall approach is underpinned by several real
world scenarios."
"Most commercial manufacturers of industrial robots require their robots to be
programmed in a proprietary language tailored to the domain - a typical
domain-specific language (DSL). However, these languages oftentimes suffer from
shortcomings such as controller-specific design, limited expressiveness and a
lack of extensibility. For that reason, we developed the extensible Robotics
API for programming industrial robots on top of a general-purpose language.
Although being a very flexible approach to programming industrial robots, a
fully-fledged language can be too complex for simple tasks. Additionally,
legacy support for code written in the original DSL has to be maintained. For
these reasons, we present a lightweight implementation of a typical robotic
DSL, the KUKA Robot Language (KRL), on top of our Robotics API. This work deals
with the challenges in reverse-engineering the language and mapping its
specifics to the Robotics API. We introduce two different approaches of
interpreting and executing KRL programs: tree-based and bytecode-based
interpretation."
"Smart homes are becoming more popular, as every day a new home appliance can
be digitally controlled. Smart Digital Homes are using a server to make
interaction with all the possible devices in one place, on a computer or
webpage. In this paper we designed and implemented a mobile application using
Windows Mobile platform that can connect to the controlling server of a Smart
Home and grants the access to the Smart Home devices and robots everywhere
possible. UML diagrams are presented to illustrate the application design
process. Robots are also considered as devices that are able to interact to
other object and devices. Scenarios are defined as a set of sequential actions
to help manage different tasks all in one place. The mobile application can
connect to the server using GPRS mobile internet and Short Message System
(SMS). Interactive home map is also designed for easier status-checking and
interacting with the devices using the mobile phones."
"The development of robot control programs is a complex task. Many robots are
different in their electrical and mechanical structure which is also reflected
in the software. Specific robot software environments support the program
development, but are mainly text-based and usually applied by experts in the
field with profound knowledge of the target robot. This paper presents a
graphical programming environment which aims to ease the development of robot
control programs. In contrast to existing graphical robot programming
environments, our approach focuses on the composition of parallel action
sequences. The developed environment allows to schedule independent robot
actions on parallel execution lines and provides mechanism to avoid
side-effects of parallel actions. The developed environment is
platform-independent and based on the model-driven paradigm. The feasibility of
our approach is shown by the application of the sequencer to a simulated
service robot and a robot for educational purpose."
"Although automatic techniques have been employed in manufacturing industries
to increase productivity and efficiency, there are still lots of manual
handling jobs, especially for assembly and maintenance jobs. In these jobs,
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the major health problems due to
overload and cumulative physical fatigue. With combination of conventional
posture analysis techniques, digital human modelling and simulation (DHM)
techniques have been developed and commercialized to evaluate the potential
physical exposures. However, those ergonomics analysis tools are mainly based
on posture analysis techniques, and until now there is still no fatigue index
available in the commercial software to evaluate the physical fatigue easily
and quickly. In this paper, a new muscle fatigue and recovery model is proposed
and extended to evaluate joint fatigue level in manual handling jobs. A special
application case is described and analyzed by digital human simulation
technique."
"In this article we address the problem of catching objects that move at a
relatively large distance from the robot, of the order of tens of times the
size of the robot itself. To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and
visual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a
robotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector
and controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light
tether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used
to retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment. In
previous work, planar casting manipulation was demon- strated to aptly catch
static objects placed at a distant, known position, thus proving it suitable
for applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In this
paper we propose an extension of the idea to controlling the position of the
end- effector to reach moving targets in 3D. The goal is achieved by an
innovative design of the casting mechanism, and by closing a real-time control
loop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. To
achieve this result, simplified yet accurate models of the system suitable for
real-time computation are developed, along with a suitable visual feedback
scheme for the flight phase. Effectiveness of the visual feedback controller is
demonstrated through experiments with a 2D casting robot."
"In this paper, we propose a decentralized coordina- tion algorithm for safe
and efficient management of a group of mobile robots following predefined paths
in a dynamic industrial environment. The proposed algorithm is based on a
shared resources protocol and a replanning strategy. It is proved to guarantee
ordered traffic flows avoiding collisions, deadlocks (stall situations) and
livelock (agents move without reaching final destinations). Mutual access to
resources has been proved for the proposed approach while condition on the
maximum number of AGVs is given to ensure the absence of deadlocks during
system evolutions. Finally conditions to verify a local livelocks will also be
proposed. In consistency with the model of distributed robotic systems (DRS),
no centralized mechanism, synchronized clock, shared memory or ground support
is needed. A local inter-robot communication, based on sign-boards, is
considered among a small number of spatially adjacent robotic units."
"In this paper we introduce a novel consensus mech- anism where agents of a
network are able to share logical values, or Booleans, representing their local
opinions on e.g. the presence of an intruder or of a fire within an indoor
environment. We first formulate the logical consensus problem, and then we
review relevant results in the literature on cellular automata and convergence
of finite-state iteration maps. Under suitable joint conditions on the
visibility of agents and their communication capability, we provide an
algorithm for generating a logical linear consensus system that is globally
stable. The solution is optimal in terms of the number of messages to be
exchanged and the time needed to reach a consensus. Moreover, to cope with
possible sensor failure, we propose a second design approach that produces
robust logical nonlinear consensus systems tolerating a given maximum number of
faults. Finally, we show applicability of the agreement mechanism to a case
study consisting of a distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS)."
"This paper addresses the problem of detecting possible intruders in a group
of autonomous robots, which coexist in a shared environment and interact with
each other according to a set of ""social behaviors"", or common rules. Such
rules specify what actions each robot is allowed to perform in the pursuit of
its individual goals: rules are distributed, i.e. they can evaluated based only
on the state of the individual robot, and on information that can be sensed
directly or through communication with immediate neighbors. We consider
intruders as robots which misbehave, i.e. do not follow the rules, because of
either spontaneous failures or malicious reprogramming. Our goal is to detect
intruders by observing the congruence of their behavior with the social rules
as applied to the current state of the overall system. Moreover, in accordance
with the fully distributed nature of the problem, the detection itself must be
peformed by individual robots, based only on local information. The paper
introduces a formalism that allows to model uniformly a large variety of
possible robot societies. The main contribution consists in the proposal of an
Intrusion Detection System, i.e. a protocol that, under suitabkle conditions,
allows individual robots to detect possible misbehaving robots in their
vicinity, and trigger possible further actions to secure the society. It is
worth noting that the generality of the protocol formalism makes so that local
monitors can be automatically generated once the cooperation rules and the
robot dynamics are specified. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
shown through application to examples of automated robotic systems."
"This paper focuses on the convergence of infor- mation in distributed systems
of agents communicating over a network. The information on which the
convergence is sought is not represented by real numbers, rather by sets of
real numbers, whose possible dynamics are given by the class of so-called
Boolean maps, involving only unions, intersections, and complements of sets.
Based on a notion of contractivity, a necessary and sufficient condition
ensuring the global and local convergence toward an equilibrium point is
presented. In particular the analysis of global convergence recovers results
already obtained by the authors, but the more general approach used in this
paper allows analogue results to be found to characterize the local
convergence."
"The paper presents a methodology to enhance the stiffness analysis of serial
and parallel manipulators with passive joints. It directly takes into account
the loading influence on the manipulator configuration and, consequently, on
its Jacobians and Hessians. The main contributions of this paper are the
introduction of a non-linear stiffness model for the manipulators with passive
joints, a relevant numerical technique for its linearization and computing of
the Cartesian stiffness matrix which allows rank-deficiency. Within the
developed technique, the manipulator elements are presented as pseudo-rigid
bodies separated by multidimensional virtual springs and perfect passive
joints. Simulation examples are presented that deal with parallel manipulators
of the Ortholide family and demonstrate the ability of the developed
methodology to describe non-linear behavior of the manipulator structure such
as a sudden change of the elastic instability properties (buckling)."
"This paper presents a new method, based on a multi-agent system and on a
digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient path planner for a manikin
or a robot for access and visibility task taking into account ergonomic
constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to solve this problem, the
human operator is integrated in the process optimization to contribute to a
global perception of the environment. This operator cooperates, in real-time,
with several automatic local elementary agents. The result of this work
validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to simulate
maintenability and mountability tasks."
"This paper presents the development of a new software in order to manage
objects, robots and mannequins in using the possibilities given by the haptic
feedback of the Phantom desktop devices. The haptic device provides 6
positional degrees of freedom sensing but three degrees force feedback. This
software called eM-Virtual Desktop is integrated in the Tecnomatix's solution
called eM-Workplace. The eM-Workplace provides powerful solutions for planning
and designing of complex assembly facilities, lines and workplaces. In the
digital mockup context, the haptic interfaces can be used to reduce the
development cycle of products. Three different loops are used to manage the
graphic, the collision detection and the haptic feedback according to theirs
own frequencies. The developed software is currently tested in industrial
context by a European automotive constructor."
"With the increasing of computer capabilities, Computer aided ergonomics (CAE)
offers new possibilities to integrate conventional ergonomic knowledge and to
develop new methods into the work design process. As mentioned in [1],
different approaches have been developed to enhance the efficiency of the
ergonomic evaluation. Ergonomic expert systems, ergonomic oriented information
systems, numerical models of human, etc. have been implemented in numerical
ergonomic software. Until now, there are ergonomic software tools available,
such as Jack, Ergoman, Delmia Human, 3DSSPP, and Santos, etc. [2-4]. The main
functions of these tools are posture analysis and posture prediction. In the
visualization part, Jack and 3DSSPP produce results to visualize virtual human
tasks in 3-dimensional, but without realistic physical properties. Nowadays,
with the development of computer technology, the simulation of physical world
is paid more attention. Physical engines [5] are used more and more in computer
game (CG) field. The advantage of physical engine is the nature physical world
environment simulation. The purpose of our research is to use the CG technology
to create a virtual environment with physical properties for ergonomic analysis
of virtual human."
"Parallel robots admit generally several solutions to the direct kinematics
problem. The aspects are associated with the maximal singularity free domains
without any singular configurations. Inside these regions, some trajectories
are possible between two solutions of the direct kinematic problem without
meeting any type of singularity: non-singular assembly mode trajectories. An
established condition for such trajectories is to have cusp points inside the
joint space that must be encircled. This paper presents an approach based on
the notion of uniqueness domains to explain this behaviour."
"In ergonomics and biomechanics, muscle fatigue models based on maximum
endurance time (MET) models are often used to integrate fatigue effect into
ergonomic and biomechanical application. However, due to the empirical
principle of those MET models, the disadvantages of this method are: 1) the MET
models cannot reveal the muscle physiology background very well; 2) there is no
general formation for those MET models to predict MET. In this paper, a
theoretical MET model is extended from a simple muscle fatigue model with
consideration of the external load and maximum voluntary contraction in passive
static exertion cases. The universal availability of the extended MET model is
analyzed in comparison to 24 existing empirical MET models. Using mathematical
regression method, 21 of the 24 MET models have intraclass correlations over
0.9, which means the extended MET model could replace the existing MET models
in a general and computationally efficient way. In addition, an important
parameter, fatigability (or fatigue resistance) of different muscle groups,
could be calculated via the mathematical regression approach. Its mean value
and its standard deviation are useful for predicting MET values of a given
population during static operations. The possible reasons influencing the
fatigue resistance were classified and discussed, and it is still a very
challenging work to find out the quantitative relationship between the fatigue
resistance and the influencing factors."
"This paper presents our work on relationship of evaluation results between
virtual environment (VE) and realistic environment (RE) for assembling tasks.
Evaluation results consist of subjective results (BPD and RPE) and objective
results (posture and physical performance). Same tasks were performed with same
experimental configurations and evaluation results were measured in RE and VE
respectively. Then these evaluation results were compared. Slight difference of
posture between VE and RE was found but not great difference of effect on
people according to conventional ergonomics posture assessment method.
Correlation of BPD and performance results between VE and RE are found by
linear regression method. Moreover, results of BPD, physical performance, and
RPE in VE are higher than that in RE with significant difference. Furthermore,
these results indicates that subjects feel more discomfort and fatigue in VE
than RE because of additional effort required in VE."
"The design of a novel prismatic drive is reported in this paper. This
transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers
mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-o-Cam was
reported elsewhere. This drive thus provides pure-rolling motion, thereby
reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. Such properties
can be used to design new transmissions for parallel-kinematics machines. In
this paper, this transmission is intended to replace the ball-screws in
Orthoglide, a three-dof parallel robot intended for machining applications."
"In this note we study the structure and the behavior of inarticulate robots.
We introduce a robot that moves by successive revolvings. The robot's structure
is analyzed, simulated and discussed in detail."
"Planning trajectories for nonholonomic systems is difficult and
computationally expensive. When facing unexpected events, it may therefore be
preferable to deform in some way the initially planned trajectory rather than
to re-plan entirely a new one. We suggest here a method based on affine
transformations to make such deformations. This method is exact and fast: the
deformations and the resulting trajectories can be computed algebraically, in
one step, and without any trajectory re-integration. To demonstrate the
possibilities offered by this new method, we use it to derive position and
orientation correction algorithms for the general class of planar wheeled
robots and for a tridimensional underwater vehicle. These algorithms allow in
turn achieving more complex applications, including obstacle avoidance,
feedback control or gap filling for sampling-based kinodynamic planners."
"According to the American Heritage Dictionary [1],Robotics is the science or
study of the technology associated with the design, fabrication, theory, and
application of Robots. The term Hoverbot is also often used to refer to
sophisticated mechanical devices that are remotely controlled by human beings
even though these devices are not autonomous. This paper describes a remotely
controlled hoverbot by installing a transmitter and receiver on both sides that
is the control computer (PC) and the hoverbot respectively. Data is transmitted
as signal or instruction via a infrastructure network which is converted into a
command for the hoverbot that operates at a remote site."
"Cusps and nodes on plane sections of the singularity locus in the joint space
of parallel manipulators play an important role in nonsingular assembly-mode
changing motions. This paper analyses in detail such points, both in the joint
space and in the workspace. It is shown that a cusp (resp. a node) defines a
point of tangency (resp. a crossing point) in the workspace between the
singular curves and the curves associated with the so-called characteristics
surfaces. The study is conducted on a planar 3-RPR manipulator for illustrative
purposes."
"Inexpensive RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data
have become widely available. We use this data to build 3D point clouds of a
full scene. In this paper, we address the task of labeling objects in this 3D
point cloud of a complete indoor scene such as an office. We propose a
graphical model that captures various features and contextual relations,
including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurrence
relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object
classes and relations, the model's parsimony becomes important and we address
that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efficient
approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning
approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and offices
(composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object
classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for
offices, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we
applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of finding
an object in a large cluttered room."
"A novel sensory substitution technique is presented. Kinesthetic and
cutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback (CF) only,
provided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and
the thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force
pattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in
terms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern
applied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both
cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the
cutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic
feedback (HF) and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this
approach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle
insertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is
connected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task.
Experiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the
cutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by
the user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. As most of the
sensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique
also has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation
systems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show
that the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with
more conventional visual feedback (VF)."
"In this paper we present the study of the mathematical model of a real life
joint used in an underwater robotic fish. Fluid-structure interaction is
utterly simplified and the motion of the joint is approximated by D\""uffing's
equation. We compare the quality of analytical harmonic solutions previously
reported, with the input-output relation obtained via truncated Volterra series
expansion. Comparisons show a trade-off between accuracy and flexibility of the
methods. The methods are discussed in detail in order to facilitate
reproduction of our results. The approach presented herein can be used to
verify results in nonlinear resonance applications and in the design of
bio-inspired compliant robots that exploit passive properties of their
dynamics. We focus on the potential use of this type of joint for energy
extraction from environmental sources, in this case a K\'arm\'an vortex street
shed by an obstacle in a flow. Open challenges and questions are mentioned
throughout the document."
"Reasons for Performing Study: Equine gait analysis has focused on 2D analysis
in the sagittal plane, while descriptions of 3D kinetics and ground reaction
force could provide more information on the Equine gait analysis. Hypothesis or
Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the 3D torques and powers
of the forelimb joints at trotting. Methods: Eight sound horses were used in
the study. A full 3D torque and power for elbow, carpus, fetlock, pastern and
coffin joints of right forelimb in horses at trot were obtained by calculating
the inverse kinetics of simplified link segmental model. Results: Over two
third of energy (70%) generated by all joints come from stance phase, and most
of energy generated was by elbow joint both in stance (77%) and sway (88%)
phases. Energy absorbed by all joints during stance (40%) and sway (60%) phases
respectively is not a big difference. During stance phase, all most two third
of energy (65%) absorbed was by fetlock joint, while over two third of energy
(74%) absorbed was by carpus joint during sway phase. Conclusions & Clinical
Relevance: This study presents a full 3D kinetic analysis of the relative
motion of the humerus, radius, cannon, pastern and coffin segments of the
forelimb at the trot. The results could provide for a more sensitive measure
for kinetic analysis."
"Summary of results in last project period (1. 10. 2009 - 30. 9. 2010) of SNFS
Project ""From locomotion to cognition""
  The research that we have been involved in, and will continue to do, starts
from the insight that in order to understand and design intelligent behavior,
we must adopt an embodied perspective, i.e. we must take the entire agent,
including its shape or morphology, the materials out of which it is built, and
its interaction with the environment into account, in addition to the neural
control. A lot of our research in the past has been on relatively low-level
sensory-motor tasks such as locomotion (e.g. walking, running, jumping),
navigation, and grasping. While this research is of interest in itself, in the
context of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, this leads to the
question of what these kinds of tasks have to do with higher levels of
cognition, or to put it more provocatively, ""What does walking have to do with
thinking?"" This question is of course reminiscent of the notorious ""symbol
grounding problem"". In contrast to most of the research on symbol grounding, we
propose to exploit the dynamic interaction between the embodied agent and the
environment as the basis for grounding. We use the term ""morphological
computation"" to designate the fact that some of the control or computation can
be taken over by the dynamic interaction derived from morphological properties
(e.g. the passive forward swing of the leg in walking, the spring-like
properties of the muscles, and the weight distribution). By taking
morphological computation into account, an agent will be able to achieve not
only faster, more robust, and more energy-efficient behavior, but also more
situated exploration by the agent for the comprehensive understanding of the
environment."

"In this paper, we report the results from the analysis of a numerical model
used for the design of a magnetic linear actuator with applications to
fin-based locomotion. Most of the current robotic fish generate bending motion
using rotary motors which implies at least one mechanical conversion of the
motion. We seek a solution that directly bends the fin and, at the same time,
is able to exploit the magneto-mechanical properties of the fin material. This
strong fin-actuator coupling blends the actuator and the body of the robot,
allowing cross optimization of the system's elements.
  We study a simplified model of an elastic element, a spring-mass system
representing a flexible fin, subjected to nonlinear forcing, emulating magnetic
interaction. The dynamics of the system is studied under unforced and periodic
forcing conditions. The analysis is focused on the limit cycles present in the
system, which allows the periodic bending of the fin and the generation of
thrust. The frequency, maximum amplitude and center of the periodic orbits
(offset of the bending) depend directly on the stiffness of the fin and the
intensity of the forcing; we use this dependency to sketch a simple parameter
controller. Although the model is strongly simplified, it provides means to
estimate first values of the parameters for this kind of actuator and it is
useful to evaluate the feasibility of minimal actuation control of such
systems."
"A simple sample-based planning method is presented which approximates
connected regions of free space with volumes in Configuration space instead of
points. The algorithm produces very sparse trees compared to point-based
planning approaches, yet it maintains probabilistic completeness guarantees.
The planner is shown to improve performance on a variety of planning problems,
by focusing sampling on more challenging regions of a planning problem,
including collision boundary areas such as narrow passages."
"In this work we consider development of IR-based communication and perception
mechanisms for real microrobotic systems. It is demonstrated that a specific
combination of hardware and software elements provides capabilities for
navigation, objects recognition, directional and unidirectional communication.
We discuss open issues and their resolution based on the experiments in the
swarm of microrobots ""Jasmine""."
"Micro- and molecular-robotic systems act as large-scale swarms. Capabilities
of sensing, communication and information processing are very limited on these
scales. This short position paper describes a swarm-based minimalistic
approach, which can be applied for coordinating collective behavior in such
systems."
"In this work we consider three different cases of robot-robot interactions
and resulting global information transfer in robot swarms. These mechanisms
define cooperative properties of the system and can be used for designing
collective behavior. These three cases are demonstrated and discussed based on
experiments in a swarm of microrobots ""Jasmine""."
"Consider a team of agents in the plane searching for and visiting target
points that appear in a bounded environment according to a stochastic renewal
process with a known absolutely continuous spatial distribution. Agents must
detect targets with limited-range onboard sensors. It is desired to minimize
the expected waiting time between the appearance of a target point, and the
instant it is visited. When the sensing radius is small, the system time is
dominated by time spent searching, and it is shown that the optimal policy
requires the agents to search a region at a relative frequency proportional to
the square root of its renewal rate. On the other hand, when targets appear
frequently, the system time is dominated by time spent servicing known targets,
and it is shown that the optimal policy requires the agents to service a region
at a relative frequency proportional to the cube root of its renewal rate.
Furthermore, the presented algorithms in this case recover the optimal
performance achieved by agents with full information of the environment.
Simulation results verify the theoretical performance of the algorithms."
"This work is devoted to communication approaches, which spread information in
robot swarms. These mechanisms are useful for large-scale systems and also for
such cases when a limited communication equipment does not allow routing of
information packages. We focus on two approaches such as virtual fields and
epidemic algorithms, discuss several aspects of hardware implementation and
demonstrate experiments performed with microrobots ""Jasmine""."
"The paper derives a new ""position translation vector"" (PTV) with remarkably

"The six axis robots are widely used in automotive industry for their good
repeatability (as defined in the ISO92983) (painting, welding, mastic
deposition, handling etc.). In the aerospace industry, robot starts to be used
for complex applications such as drilling, riveting, fiber placement, NDT, etc.
Given the positioning performance of serial robots, precision applications
require usually external measurement device with complexes calibration
procedure in order to reach the precision needed. New applications in the
machining field of composite material (aerospace, naval, or wind turbine for
example) intend to use off line programming of serial robot without the use of
calibration or external measurement device. For those applications, the
position, orientation and path trajectory precision of the tool center point of
the robot are needed to generate the machining operation. This article presents
the different conditions that currently limit the development of robots in
robotic machining applications. We analyze the dynamical behavior of a robot
KUKA KR240-2 (located at the University of Bordeaux 1) equipped with a HSM
Spindle (42000 rpm, 18kW). This analysis is done in three stages. The first
step is determining the self-excited frequencies of the robot structure for
three different configurations of work. The second phase aims to analyze the
dynamical vibration of the structure as the spindle is activated without
cutting. The third stage consists of vibration analysis during a milling
operation."
"Attempts to install a rotating tool at the end of a robot arm
poly-articulated date back twenty years, but these robots were not designed for
that. Indeed, two essential features are necessary for machining: high rigidity
and precision in a given workspace. The experimental results presented are the
dynamic identification of a poly-articulated robot equipped with an integrated
spindle. This study aims to highlight the influence of the geometric
configuration of the robot arm on the overall stiffness of the system. The
spindle is taken into account as an additional weight on board but also as a
dynamical excitation for the robot KUKA KR_240_2. Study of the robotic
machining vibrations shows the suitable directions of movement in milling
process"
"This article presents a new open-source C++ implementation to solve the SLAM
problem, which is focused on genericity, versatility and high execution speed.
It is based on an original object oriented architecture, that allows the
combination of numerous sensors and landmark types, and the integration of
various approaches proposed in the literature. The system capacities are
illustrated by the presentation of an inertial/vision SLAM approach, for which
several improvements over existing methods have been introduced, and that copes
with very high dynamic motions. Results with a hand-held camera are presented."
"We consider the synthesis of control policies from temporal logic
specifications for robots that interact with multiple dynamic environment
agents. Each environment agent is modeled by a Markov chain whereas the robot
is modeled by a finite transition system (in the deterministic case) or Markov
decision process (in the stochastic case). Existing results in probabilistic
verification are adapted to solve the synthesis problem. To partially address
the state explosion issue, we propose an incremental approach where only a
small subset of environment agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedure
initially and more agents are successively added until we hit the constraints
on computational resources. Our algorithm runs in an anytime fashion where the
probability that the robot satisfies its specification increases as the
algorithm progresses."
"One of the major impacts of climatic changes is due to destroying of forest.
Destroying of forest takes place in many ways but the majority of the forest is
destroyed due to wild forest fires. In this paper we have presented a path
planning algorithm for extinguishing fires which uses Wireless Sensor and Actor
Networks (WSANs) for detecting fires. Since most of the works on forest fires
are based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and a collection of work has been
done on coverage, message transmission, deployment of nodes, battery power
depletion of sensor nodes in WSNs we focused our work in path planning approach
of the Actor to move to the target area where the fire has occurred and
extinguish it. An incremental approach is presented in order to determine the
successive moves of the Actor to extinguish fire in an environment with and
without obstacles. This is done by comparing the moves determined with target
location readings obtained using sensors until the Actor reaches the target
area to extinguish fires."
"This paper considers onboard control of a small-sized quadrotor using a
strapdown embedded optical flow sensor which is conventionally used for desktop
mice. The vehicle considered in this paper can carry only few dozen grams of
payload, therefore conventional camera-based optical flow methods are not
applicable. We present hovering control of the small-sized quadrotor using a
single-chip optical flow sensor, implemented on an 8-bit microprocessor without
external sensors or communication with a ground control station. Detailed
description of all the system components is provided along with evaluation of
the accuracy. Experimental results from flight tests are validated with the
ground-truth data provided by a high-accuracy reference system."
"We address the problem of estimating a rigid transformation between two point
sets, which is a key module for target tracking system using Light Detection
And Ranging (LiDAR). A fast implementation of Expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm is presented whose complexity is O(N) with $N$ the number of scan
points."
"Military is one of many industries that is more computer-dependent than ever
before, from soldiers with computerized weapons, and tactical wireless devices,
to commanders with advanced battle management, command and control systems.
Fundamentally, command and control is the process of planning, monitoring, and
commanding military personnel, weaponry equipment, and combating vehicles to
execute military missions. In fact, command and control systems are
revolutionizing as war fighting is changing into cyber, technology,
information, and unmanned warfare. As a result, a new design model that
supports scalability, reusability, maintainability, survivability, and
interoperability is needed to allow commanders, hundreds of miles away from the
battlefield, to plan, monitor, evaluate, and control the war events in a
dynamic, robust, agile, and reliable manner. This paper proposes a
service-oriented architecture for weaponry and battle command and control
systems, made out of loosely-coupled and distributed web services. The proposed
architecture consists of three elementary tiers: the client tier that
corresponds to any computing military equipment; the server tier that
corresponds to the web services that deliver the basic functionalities for the
client tier; and the middleware tier that corresponds to an enterprise service
bus that promotes interoperability between all the interconnected entities. A
command and control system was simulated and experimented and it successfully
exhibited the desired features of SOA. Future research can improve upon the
proposed architecture so much so that it supports encryption for securing the
exchange of data between the various communicating entities of the system."
"Currently, industrial sectors are transforming their business processes into
e-services and component-based architectures to build flexible, robust, and
scalable systems, and reduce integration-related maintenance and development
costs. Robotics is yet another promising and fast-growing industry that deals
with the creation of machines that operate in an autonomous fashion and serve
for various applications including space exploration, weaponry, laboratory
research, and manufacturing. It is in space exploration that the most common
type of robots is the planetary rover which moves across the surface of a
planet and conducts a thorough geological study of the celestial surface. This
type of rover system is still ad-hoc in that it incorporates its software into
its core hardware making the whole system cohesive, tightly-coupled, more
susceptible to shortcomings, less flexible, hard to be scaled and maintained,
and impossible to be adapted to other purposes. This paper proposes a
service-oriented architecture for space exploration robotic rover systems made
out of loosely-coupled and distributed web services. The proposed architecture
consists of three elementary tiers: the client tier that corresponds to the
actual rover; the server tier that corresponds to the web services; and the
middleware tier that corresponds to an Enterprise Service Bus which promotes
interoperability between the interconnected entities. The niche of this
architecture is that rover's software components are decoupled and isolated
from the rover's body and possibly deployed at a distant location. A
service-oriented architecture promotes integrate-ability, scalability,
reusability, maintainability, and interoperability for client-to-server
communication."
"As general purpose robots become more capable, pre-programming of all tasks
at the factory will become less practical. We would like for non-technical
human owners to be able to communicate, through interaction with their robot,
the details of a new task; we call this interaction ""task communication"".
During task communication the robot must infer the details of the task from
unstructured human signals and it must choose actions that facilitate this
inference. In this paper we propose the use of a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) for representing the task communication problem; with
the unobservable task details and unobservable intentions of the human teacher
captured in the state, with all signals from the human represented as
observations, and with the cost function chosen to penalize uncertainty. We
work through an example representation of task communication as a POMDP, and
present results from a user experiment on an interactive virtual robot,
compared with a human controlled virtual robot, for a task involving a single
object movement and binary approval input from the teacher. The results suggest
that the proposed POMDP representation produces robots that are robust to
teacher error, that can accurately infer task details, and that are perceived
to be intelligent."
"This paper reviews the aspects of the LEGO\textregistered
Mindstorms\trademark robotics invention system 2.0 \trademark (RIS), by
presenting the different elements of the kit, and relating them to actual robot
components and norms. Furthermore a comparison between the LCS and Java is
made, as well as comparing the RCX board to other technologies, specifically
LEGO \textregistered NXT and MIT's ""Handy Board"". Also, concrete examples of
application using the RIS are presented."
"Human muscle fatigue is considered to be one of the main reasons for
Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD). Recent models have been introduced to define
muscle fatigue for static postures. However, the main drawbacks of these models
are that the dynamic effect of the human and the external load are not taken
into account. In this paper, each human joint is assumed to be controlled by
two muscle groups to generate motions such as push/pull. The joint torques are
computed using Lagrange's formulation to evaluate the dynamic factors of the
muscle fatigue model. An experiment is defined to validate this assumption and
the result for one person confirms its feasibility. The evaluation of this
model can predict the fatigue and MSD risk in industry production quickly."
"The paper is devoted to the compliance errors compensation for parallel
manipulators under external loading. Proposed approach is based on the
non-linear stiffness modeling and reduces to a proper adjusting of a target
trajectory. In contrast to previous works, in addition to compliance errors
caused by machining forces, the problem of assembling errors caused by
inaccuracy in the kinematic chains is considered. The advantages and practical
significance of the proposed approach are illustrated by examples that deal
with groove milling with Orthoglide manipulator."
"This paper proposes a new design method to determine the feasible set of
parameters of translational or position/orientation decoupled parallel robots
for a prescribed singularity-free workspace of regular shape. The suggested
method uses Groebner bases to define the singularities and the cylindrical
algebraic decomposition to characterize the set of parameters. It makes it
possible to generate all the robot designs. A 3-RRR decoupled robot is used to
validate the proposed design method."
"This paper investigates the conditions in the design parameter space for the
existence and distribution of the cusp locus for planar parallel manipulators.
Cusp points make possible non-singular assembly-mode changing motion, which
increases the maximum singularity-free workspace. An accurate algorithm for the
determination is proposed amending some imprecisions done by previous existing
algorithms. This is combined with methods of Cylindric Algebraic Decomposition,
Gr\""obner bases and Discriminant Varieties in order to partition the parameter
space into cells with constant number of cusp points. These algorithms will
allow us to classify a family of degenerate 3-RPR manipulators."
"Motion planning problems have been studied by both the robotics and the
controls research communities for a long time, and many algorithms have been
developed for their solution. Among them, incremental sampling-based motion
planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), and the
Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) have become very popular recently, owing to
their implementation simplicity and their advantages in handling
high-dimensional problems. Although these algorithms work very well in
practice, the quality of the computed solution is often not good, i.e., the
solution can be far from the optimal one. A recent variation of RRT, namely the
RRT* algorithm, bypasses this drawback of the traditional RRT algorithm, by
ensuring asymptotic optimality as the number of samples tends to infinity.
Nonetheless, the convergence rate to the optimal solution may still be slow.
This paper presents a new incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm
based on Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), denoted RRT# (RRT ""sharp"")
which also guarantees asymptotic optimality but, in addition, it also ensures
that the constructed spanning tree of the geometric graph is consistent after
each iteration. In consistent trees, the vertices which have the potential to
be part of the optimal solution have the minimum cost-come-value. This implies
that the best possible solution is readily computed if there are some vertices
in the current graph that are already in the goal region. Numerical results
compare with the RRT* algorithm."
"Low-cost sensing gloves for reconstruction posture provide measurements which
are limited under several regards. They are generated through an imperfectly
known model, are subject to noise, and may be less than the number of Degrees
of Freedom (DoFs) of the hand. Under these conditions, direct reconstruction of
the hand posture is an ill-posed problem, and performance can be very poor.
This paper examines the problem of estimating the posture of a human hand
using(low-cost) sensing gloves, and how to improve their performance by
exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands. To
increase the accuracy of pose reconstruction without modifying the glove
hardware - hence basically at no extra cost - we propose to collect, organize,
and exploit information on the probabilistic distribution of human hand poses
in common tasks. We discuss how a database of such an a priori information can
be built, represented in a hierarchy of correlation patterns or postural
synergies, and fused with glove data in a consistent way, so as to provide a
good hand pose reconstruction in spite of insufficient and inaccurate sensing
data. Simulations and experiments on a low-cost glove are reported which
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques."
"In this paper we study the problem of improving human hand pose sensing
device performance by exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently
use their hands in grasping tasks. In a companion paper we studied the problem
of maximizing the reconstruction accuracy of the hand pose from partial and
noisy data provided by any given pose sensing device (a sensorized ""glove"")
taking into account statistical a priori information. In this paper we consider
the dual problem of how to design pose sensing devices, i.e. how and where to
place sensors on a glove, to get maximum information about the actual hand
posture. We study the continuous case, whereas individual sensing elements in
the glove measure a linear combination of joint angles, the discrete case,
whereas each measure corresponds to a single joint angle, and the most general
hybrid case, whereas both continuous and discrete sensing elements are
available. The objective is to provide, for given a priori information and
fixed number of measurements, the optimal design minimizing in average the
reconstruction error. Solutions relying on the geometrical synergy definition
as well as gradient flow-based techniques are provided. Simulations of
reconstruction performance show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal
design."
"We consider the problem of carrier-phase differential GPS positioning for an
land vehicle navigation system (LVNS), tightly coupled with an inertial
measurement unit (IMU) and a speedometer. The primary focus is to apply
Bayesian network to an IMU-aided GPS positioning system based on carrier-phase
differential GPS. We describe the implementation details of the positioning
system that integrates GPS measurements (i.e., pseudo-range, carrier-phase and
doppler), IMU measurements, and speedometer measurements. We derive the
linearized state process equation and the measurement equation for GPS and
speedometer. To account for constraints of land vehicle, we add two more pseudo
measurements to ensure the perpendicular velocities close to zero."
"During the conceptual and prototype design stage of an industrial product, it
is crucial to take assembly/disassembly and maintenance operations in advance.
A well-designed system should enable relatively easy access of operating
manipulators in the constrained environment and reduce musculoskeletal disorder
risks for those manual handling operations. Trajectory planning comes up as an
important issue for those assembly and maintenance operations under a
constrained environment, since it determines the accessibility and the other
ergonomics issues, such as muscle effort and its related fatigue. In this
paper, a customer-oriented interactive approach is proposed to partially solve
ergonomic related issues encountered during the design stage under a
constrained system for the operator's convenience. Based on a single objective
optimization method, trajectory planning for different operators could be
generated automatically. Meanwhile, a motion capture based method assists the
operator to guide the trajectory planning interactively when either a local
minimum is encountered within the single objective optimization or the operator
prefers guiding the virtual human manually. Besides that, a physical engine is
integrated into this approach to provide physically realistic simulation in
real time manner, so that collision free path and related dynamic information
could be computed to determine further muscle fatigue and accessibility of a
product design"
"Pushing/Pulling tasks is an important part of work in many industries.
Usually, most researchers study the Push/Pull tasks by analyzing different
posture conditions, force requirements, velocity factors, etc. However few
studies have reported the effects of fatigue. Fatigue caused by physical
loading is one of the main reasons responsible for MusculoSkeletal Disorders
(MSD). In this paper, muscle groups of articulation is considered and from
joint level a new approach is proposed for muscle fatigue evaluation in the
arms Push/Pull operations. The objective of this work is to predict the muscle
fatigue situation in the Push/Pull tasks in order to reduce the probability of
MSD problems for workers. A case study is presented to use this new approach
for analyzing arm fatigue in Pushing/Pulling."
"Our goal in this paper is to plan the motion of a robot in a partitioned
environment with dynamically changing, locally sensed rewards. We assume that
arbitrary assumptions on the reward dynamics can be given. The robot aims to
accomplish a high-level temporal logic surveillance mission and to locally
optimize the collection of the rewards in the visited regions. These two
objectives often conflict and only a compromise between them can be reached. We
address this issue by taking into consideration a user-defined preference
function that captures the trade-off between the importance of collecting high
rewards and the importance of making progress towards a surveyed region. Our
solution leverages ideas from the automata-based approach to model checking. We
demonstrate the utilization and benefits of the suggested framework in an
illustrative example."
"Many robotic systems deal with uncertainty by performing a sequence of
information gathering actions. In this work, we focus on the problem of
efficiently constructing such a sequence by drawing an explicit connection to
submodularity. Ideally, we would like a method that finds the optimal sequence,
taking the minimum amount of time while providing sufficient information.
Finding this sequence, however, is generally intractable. As a result, many
well-established methods select actions greedily. Surprisingly, this often
performs well. Our work first explains this high performance -- we note a
commonly used metric, reduction of Shannon entropy, is submodular under certain
assumptions, rendering the greedy solution comparable to the optimal plan in
the offline setting. However, reacting online to observations can increase
performance. Recently developed notions of adaptive submodularity provide
guarantees for a greedy algorithm in this online setting. In this work, we
develop new methods based on adaptive submodularity for selecting a sequence of
information gathering actions online. In addition to providing guarantees, we
can capitalize on submodularity to attain additional computational speedups. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in simulation and on a robot."
"In this paper, we analyze the robustness of the PSO-based approach to
parameter estimation of robot dynamics presented in Part One. We have made
attempts to make the PSO method more robust by experimenting with potential
cost functions. The simulated system is a cylindrical robot; through
simulation, the robot is excited, samples are taken, error is added to the
samples, and the noisy samples are used for estimating the robot parameters
through the presented method. Comparisons are made with the least squares,
total least squares, and robust least squares methods of estimation."
"This paper illustrates how a 3 degrees of freedom, Cartesian robot can be
given the task of playing ping pong against a human player. We present an
algorithm based on particle swarm optimization for the robot to calculate when
and how to hit an approaching ball. Simulation results are shown to depict the
effectiveness of our approach. Although emphasis is placed on sending the ball
to a desired point on the ping pong table, it is shown that our method may be
adjusted to meet the requirements of a variety of ball hitting strategies."
"Offline procedures for estimating parameters of robot dynamics are
practically based on the parameterized inverse dynamic model. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to parameter estimation of robot dynamics which
removes the necessity of parameterization (i.e. finding the minimum number of
parameters from which the dynamics can be calculated through a linear model
with respect to these parameters). This offline approach is based on a simple
and powerful swarm intelligence tool: the particle swarm optimization (PSO). In
this paper, we discuss and validate the method through simulated experiments.
In Part Two we analyze our method in terms of robustness and compare it to
robust analytical methods of estimation."
"The paper focuses on the calibration of elastostatic parameters of spatial
anthropomorphic robots. It proposes a new strategy for optimal selection of the
measurement configurations that essentially increases the efficiency of robot
calibration. This strategy is based on the concept of the robot test-pose and
ensures the best compliance error compensation for the test configuration. The
advantages of the proposed approach and its suitability for practical
applications are illustrated by numerical examples, which deal with calibration
of elastostatic parameters of a 3 degrees of freedom anthropomorphic
manipulator with rigid links and compliant actuated joints"
"The paper focuses on the accuracy improvement of geometric and elasto-static
calibration of industrial robots. It proposes industry-oriented performance
measures for the calibration experiment design. They are based on the concept
of manipulator test-pose and referred to the end-effector location accuracy
after application of the error compensation algorithm, which implements the
identified parameters. This approach allows the users to define optimal
measurement configurations for robot calibration for given work piece location
and machining forces/torques. These performance measures are suitable for
comparing the calibration plans for both simple and complex trajectories to be
performed. The advantages of the developed techniques are illustrated by an
example that deals with machining using robotic manipulator."
"The paper presents the compliance errors compensation technique for
over-constrained parallel manipulators under external and internal loadings.
This technique is based on the non-linear stiffness modeling which is able to
take into account the influence of non-perfect geometry of serial chains caused
by manufacturing errors. Within the developed technique, the deviation
compensation reduces to an adjustment of a target trajectory that is modified
in the off-line mode. The advantages and practical significance of the proposed
technique are illustrated by an example that deals with groove milling by the
Orthoglide manipulator that considers different locations of the workpiece. It
is also demonstrated that the impact of the compliance errors and the errors
caused by inaccuracy in serial chains cannot be taken into account using the
superposition principle."
"The paper focuses on the stiffness modeling of parallel manipulators composed
of non-perfect serial chains, whose geometrical parameters differ from the
nominal ones. In these manipulators, there usually exist essential internal
forces/torques that considerably affect the stiffness properties and also
change the end-effector location. These internal load-ings are caused by
elastic deformations of the manipulator ele-ments during assembling, while the
geometrical errors in the chains are compensated for by applying appropriate
forces. For this type of manipulators, a non-linear stiffness modeling
tech-nique is proposed that allows us to take into account inaccuracy in the
chains and to aggregate their stiffness models for the case of both small and
large deflections. Advantages of the developed technique and its ability to
compute and compensate for the compliance errors caused by different factors
are illustrated by an example that deals with parallel manipulators of the
Or-thoglide family"
"The paper is devoted to the elastostatic calibration of industrial robots,
which is used for precise machining of large-dimensional parts made of
composite materials. In this technological process, the interaction between the
robot and the workpiece causes essential elastic deflections of the manipulator
components that should be compensated by the robot controller using relevant
elastostatic model of this mechanism. To estimate parameters of this model, an
advanced calibration technique is applied that is based on the non-linear
experiment design theory, which is adopted for this particular application. In
contrast to previous works, it is proposed a concept of the user-defined
test-pose, which is used to evaluate the calibration experiments quality. In
the frame of this concept, the related optimization problem is defined and
numerical routines are developed, which allow generating optimal set of
manipulator configurations and corresponding forces/torques for a given number
of the calibration experiments. Some specific kinematic constraints are also
taken into account, which insure feasibility of calibration experiments for the
obtained configurations and allow avoiding collision between the robotic
manipulator and the measurement equipment. The efficiency of the developed
technique is illustrated by an application example that deals with elastostatic
calibration of the serial manipulator used for robot-based machining."

"In robotics, gradient-free optimization algorithms (e.g. evolutionary
algorithms) are often used only in simulation because they require the
evaluation of many candidate solutions. Nevertheless, solutions obtained in
simulation often do not work well on the real device. The transferability
approach aims at crossing this gap between simulation and reality by
\emph{making the optimization algorithm aware of the limits of the simulation}.
  In the present paper, we first describe the transferability function, that
maps solution descriptors to a score representing how well a simulator matches
the reality. We then show that this function can be learned using a regression
algorithm and a few experiments with the real devices. Our results are
supported by an extensive study of the reality gap for a simple quadruped robot
whose control parameters are optimized. In particular, we mapped the whole
search space in reality and in simulation to understand the differences between
the fitness landscapes."
"We propose a human-supervised control synthesis method for a stochastic
Dubins vehicle such that the probability of satisfying a specification given as
a formula in a fragment of Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL) over a
set of environmental properties is maximized. Under some mild assumptions, we
construct a finite approximation for the motion of the vehicle in the form of a
tree-structured Markov Decision Process (MDP). We introduce an efficient
algorithm, which exploits the tree structure of the MDP, for synthesizing a
control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfaction. For the proposed
PCTL fragment, we define the specification update rules that guarantee the
increase (or decrease) of the satisfaction probability. We introduce an
incremental algorithm for synthesizing an updated MDP control policy that
reuses the initial solution. The initial specification can be updated, using
the rules, until the supervisor is satisfied with both the updated
specification and the corresponding satisfaction probability. We propose an
offline and an online application of this method."
"Recent advances in telecommunications have enabled surgeons to operate
remotely on patients with the use of robotics. The investigation and testing of
remote surgery using a robotic arm is presented. The robotic arm is designed to
have four degrees of freedom that track the surgeon's x, y, z positions and the
rotation angle of the forearm {\theta}. The system comprises two main
subsystems viz. the detecting and actuating systems. The detection system uses
infrared light-emitting diodes, a retroreflective bracelet and two infrared
cameras which as a whole determine the coordinates of the surgeon's forearm.
The actuation system, or robotic arm, is based on a lead screw mechanism which
can obtain a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s with a 1.5 degree/step for the
end-effector. The infrared detection and encoder resolutions are below 0.6
mm/pixel and 0.4 mm respectively, which ensures the robotic arm can operate
precisely. The surgeon is able to monitor the patient with the use of a
graphical user interface on the display computer. The lead screw system is
modelled and compared to experimentation results. The system is controlled
using a simple proportional-integrator (PI) control scheme which is implemented
on a dSpace control unit. The control design results in a rise time of less
than 0.5 s, a steady-state error of less than 1 mm and settling time of less
than 1.4 s. The system accumulates, over an extended period of time, an error
of approximately 4 mm due to inertial effects of the robotic arm. The results
show promising system performance characteristics for a relatively inexpensive
solution to a relatively advanced application."
"In this paper, we propose a sampling-based motion planning algorithm that
finds an infinite path satisfying a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a
set of properties satisfied by some regions in a given environment. The
algorithm has three main features. First, it is incremental, in the sense that
the procedure for finding a satisfying path at each iteration scales only with
the number of new samples generated at that iteration. Second, the underlying
graph is sparse, which guarantees the low complexity of the overall method.
Third, it is probabilistically complete. Examples illustrating the usefulness
and the performance of the method are included."
"This paper develops a probabilistic anticipation algorithm for dynamic
objects observed by an autonomous robot in an urban environment. Predictive
Gaussian mixture models are used due to their ability to probabilistically
capture continuous and discrete obstacle decisions and behaviors; the
predictive system uses the probabilistic output (state estimate and covariance)
of a tracking system, and map of the environment to compute the probability
distribution over future obstacle states for a specified anticipation horizon.
A Gaussian splitting method is proposed based on the sigma-point transform and
the nonlinear dynamics function, which enables increased accuracy as the number
of mixands grows. An approach to caching elements of this optimal splitting
method is proposed, in order to enable real-time implementation. Simulation
results and evaluations on data from the research community demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm can accurately anticipate the probability distributions
over future states of nonlinear systems."
"This paper presents a method for robot self-recognition and self-adaptation
through the analysis of the contact between the robot end effector and its
surrounding environment. Often, in off-line robot programming, the idealized
robotic environment (the virtual one) does not reflect accurately the real one.
In this situation, we are in the presence of a partially unknown environment
(PUE). Thus, robotic systems must have some degree of autonomy to overcome this
situation, especially when contact exists. The proposed force/motion control
system has an external control loop based on forces and torques exerted on the
robot end effector and an internal control loop based on robot motion. The
external control loop is tested with an optimal proportional integrative (PI)
and a fuzzy-PI controller. The system performance is validated with real-world
experiments involving contact in PUEs."
"This paper focuses on intuitive and direct off-line robot programming from a
CAD drawing running on a common 3-D CAD package. It explores the most suitable
way to represent robot motion in a CAD drawing, how to automatically extract
such motion data from the drawing, make the mapping of data from the virtual
(CAD model) to the real environment and the process of automatic generation of
robot paths/programs. In summary, this study aims to present a novel CAD-based
robot programming system accessible to anyone with basic knowledge of CAD and
robotics. Experiments on different manipulation tasks show the effectiveness
and versatility of the proposed approach."
"More and more, new ways of interaction between humans and robots are desired,
something that allow us to program a robot in an intuitive way, quickly and
with a high-level of abstraction from the robot language. In this paper is
presented a CAD-based system that allows users with basic skills in CAD and
without skills in robot programming to generate robot programs from a CAD model
of a robotic cell. When the CAD model reproduces exactly the real scenario, the
system presents a satisfactory performance. On the contrary, when the CAD model
does not reproduce exactly the real scenario or the calibration process is
poorly done, we are dealing with uncertain (unstructured environment). In order
to minimize or eliminate the previously mentioned problems, it was introduced
sensory feedback (force and torque sensing) in the robotic framework. By
controlling the end-effector pose and specifying its relationship to the
interaction/contact forces, robot programmers can ensure that the robot
maneuvers in an unstructured environment, damping possible impacts and also
increasing the tolerance to positioning errors from the calibration process.
Fuzzy-PI reasoning was used as a force control technique. The effectiveness of
the proposed approach was evaluated in a series of experiments."
"This paper presents methodologies to discretize nominal robot paths extracted
from 3-D CAD drawings. Behind robot path discretization is the ability to have
a robot adjusting the traversed paths so that the contact between robot tool
and work-piece is properly maintained. In addition, a hybrid force/motion
control system based on Fuzzy-PI control is proposed to adjust robot paths with
external sensory feedback. All these capabilities allow to facilitate the robot
programming process and to increase the robots autonomy."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a CAD-based human-robot
interface that allows non-expert users to teach a robot in a manner similar to
that used by human beings to teach each other.
  Design/methodology/approach - Intuitive robot programming is achieved by
using CAD drawings to generate robot programs off-line. Sensory feedback allows
minimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the
robot paths during robot operation.
  Findings - It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from
a common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or
CAD model accuracy.
  Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the proposed system has
to do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular
technological applications.
  Practical implications - Since most manufacturing companies have CAD packages
in their facilities today, CAD-based robot programming may be a good option to
program robots without the need for skilled robot programmers.
  Originality/value - The paper proposes a new CAD-based robot programming
system. Robot programs are directly generated from a CAD drawing running on a
commonly available 3D CAD package (Autodesk Inventor) and not from a
commercial, computer aided robotics (CAR) software, making it a simple CAD
integrated solution. This is a low-cost and low-setup time system where no
advanced robot programming skills are required to operate it. In summary, robot
programs are generated with a high-level of abstraction from the robot
language."
"In this paper, an adaptive and low-cost robotic coating platform for small
production series is presented. This new platform presents a flexible
architecture that enables fast/automatic system adaptive behaviour without
human intervention. The concept is based on contactless technology, using
artificial vision and laser scanning to identify and characterize different
workpieces travelling on a conveyor. Using laser triangulation, the workpieces
are virtually reconstructed through a simplified cloud of three-dimensional
(3D) points. From those reconstructed models, several algorithms are
implemented to extract information about workpieces profile (pattern
recognition), size, boundary and pose. Such information is then used to on-line
adjust the base robot programmes. These robot programmes are off-line generated
from a 3D computer-aided design model of each different workpiece profile.
Finally, the robotic manipulator executes the coating process after its base
programmes have been adjusted. This is a low-cost and fully autonomous system
that allows adapting the robots behaviour to different manufacturing
situations. It means that the robot is ready to work over any piece at any
time, and thus, small production series can be reduced to as much as a
one-object series. No skilled workers and large setup times are needed to
operate it. Experimental results showed that this solution proved to be
efficient and can be applied not only for spray coating purposes but also for
many other industrial processes (automatic manipulation, pick-and-place,
inspection, etc.)."
"Most of industrial robots are still programmed using the typical teaching
process, through the use of the robot teach pendant. In this paper is proposed
an accelerometer-based system to control an industrial robot using two low-cost
and small 3-axis wireless accelerometers. These accelerometers are attached to
the human arms, capturing its behavior (gestures and postures). An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) trained with a back-propagation algorithm was used to
recognize arm gestures and postures, which then will be used as input in the
control of the robot. The aim is that the robot starts the movement almost at
the same time as the user starts to perform a gesture or posture (low response
time). The results show that the system allows the control of an industrial
robot in an intuitive way. However, the achieved recognition rate of gestures
and postures (92%) should be improved in future, keeping the compromise with
the system response time (160 milliseconds). Finally, the results of some tests
performed with an industrial robot are presented and discussed."
"Purpose - Most industrial robots are still programmed using the typical
teaching process, through the use of the robot teach pendant. This is a tedious
and time-consuming task that requires some technical expertise, and hence new
approaches to robot programming are required. The purpose of this paper is to
present a robotic system that allows users to instruct and program a robot with
a high-level of abstraction from the robot language.
  Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents in detail a robotic system
that allows users, especially non-expert programmers, to instruct and program a
robot just showing it what it should do, in an intuitive way. This is done
using the two most natural human interfaces (gestures and speech), a force
control system and several code generation techniques. Special attention will
be given to the recognition of gestures, where the data extracted from a motion
sensor (three-axis accelerometer) embedded in the Wii remote controller was
used to capture human hand behaviours. Gestures (dynamic hand positions) as
well as manual postures (static hand positions) are recognized using a
statistical approach and artificial neural networks.
  Practical implications - The key contribution of this paper is that it offers
a practical method to program robots by means of gestures and speech, improving
work efficiency and saving time.
  Originality/value - This paper presents an alternative to the typical robot
teaching process, extending the concept of human-robot interaction and
co-worker scenario. Since most companies do not have engineering resources to
make changes or add new functionalities to their robotic manufacturing systems,
this system constitutes a major advantage for small- to medium-sized
enterprises."
"We review the work on data-driven grasp synthesis and the methodologies for
sampling and ranking candidate grasps. We divide the approaches into three
groups based on whether they synthesize grasps for known, familiar or unknown
objects. This structure allows us to identify common object representations and
perceptual processes that facilitate the employed data-driven grasp synthesis
technique. In the case of known objects, we concentrate on the approaches that
are based on object recognition and pose estimation. In the case of familiar
objects, the techniques use some form of a similarity matching to a set of
previously encountered objects. Finally for the approaches dealing with unknown
objects, the core part is the extraction of specific features that are
indicative of good grasps. Our survey provides an overview of the different
methodologies and discusses open problems in the area of robot grasping. We
also draw a parallel to the classical approaches that rely on analytic
formulations."
"This note improves our above-mentioned recent work by effectively depressing
the adverse effect of the lever arm on attitude estimation."
"Science teaching in secondary schools is often abstract for students. Even if
some experiments can be conducted in classrooms, mainly for chemistry or some
physics fields, mathematics is not an experimental science. Teachers have to
convince students that theorems have practical implications. We present
teachers an original and easy-to-use pedagogical tool: a cable-driven robot
with a Web-based remote control interface. The robot implements several
scientific concepts such as 3D-geometry and kinematics. The remote control
enables the teacher to move freely in the classroom."
"We use the recently introduced factorization theory of motion polynomials
over the dual quaternions for the synthesis of closed kinematic loops with six
revolute joints that visit four prescribed poses. Our approach admits either no
or a one-parametric family of solutions. We suggest strategies for picking good
solutions from this family."
"This paper introduces a new mobile sensor scheduling problem, involving a
single robot tasked with monitoring several events of interest that occur at
different locations. Of particular interest is the monitoring of transient
events that can not be easily forecast. Application areas range from natural
phenomena ({\em e.g.}, monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcano
using a ground robot) to urban activities ({\em e.g.}, monitoring early
formations of traffic congestion using an aerial robot). Motivated by those and
many other examples, this paper focuses on problems in which the precise
occurrence times of the events are unknown {\em a priori}, but statistics for
their inter-arrival times are available. The robot's task is to monitor the
events to optimize the following two objectives: {\em (i)} maximize the number
of events observed and {\em (ii)} minimize the delay between two consecutive
observations of events occurring at the same location. The paper considers the
case when a robot is tasked with optimizing the event observations in a
balanced manner, following a cyclic patrolling route. First, assuming the
cyclic ordering of stations is known, we prove the existence and uniqueness of
the optimal solution, and show that the optimal solution has desirable
convergence and robustness properties. Our constructive proof also produces an
efficient algorithm for computing the unique optimal solution with $O(n)$ time
complexity, in which $n$ is the number of stations, with $O(\log n)$ time
complexity for incrementally adding or removing stations. Except for the
algorithm, most of the analysis remains valid when the cyclic order is unknown.
We then provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme that gives a
$(1+\epsilon)$-optimal solution for this more general, NP-hard problem."
"With the development of robotics and artificial intelligence field
unceasingly thorough, path planning as an important field of robot calculation
has been widespread concern. This paper analyzes the current development of
robot and path planning algorithm and focuses on the advantages and
disadvantages of the traditional intelligent path planning as well as the path
planning. The problem of mobile robot path planning is studied by using ant
colony algorithm, and it also provides some solving methods."
"Programming robots is a complicated and time-consuming task. A robot is
essentially a real-time, distributed embedded system. Often, control and
communication paths within the system are tightly coupled to the actual
physical configuration of the robot. Thus, programming a robot is a very
challenging task for domain experts who do not have a dedicated background in
robotics. In this paper we present an approach towards a domain specific
language, which is intended to reduce the efforts and the complexity which is
required when developing robotic applications. Furthermore we apply a software
product line approach to realize a configurable code generator which produces
C++ code which can either be run on real robots or on a robot simulator."
"This paper presents a solution to controlling humanoid robotic systems. The
robot can be programmed to execute certain complex actions based on basic
motion primitives. The humanoid robot is programmed using a PC. The software
running on the PC can obtain at any given moment information about the state of
the robot, or it can program the robot to execute a different action, providing
the possibility of implementing a complex behavior. We want to provide the
robotic system the ability to understand more on the external real world. In
this paper we describe a method for detecting ellipses in real world images
using the Randomized Hough Transform with Result Clustering. Real world images
are preprocessed, noise reduction, greyscale transform, edge detection and
finaly binarization in order to be processed by the actual ellipse detector.
After all the ellipses are detected a post processing phase clusters the
results."
"This paper introduces a new algorithm for accurately reconstructing two
smooth orthogonal surfaces by processing ultrasonic data. The proposed
technique is based on a preliminary analysis of a waveform energy indicator in
order to classify the data as belonging to one of the two flat surfaces. The
following minimization of a nonlinear cost function, inspired by the
mathematical definition of Gibbs entropy, allows to estimate the plane
parameters robustly with respect to the presence of outlying data. These
outliers are mainly due to the effect of multiple reflections arising in the
surfaces intersection region. The scanning system consists of four inexpensive
ultrasonic sensors rotated by means of a precision servo digital motor in order
to obtain distance measurements for each orientation. Experimental results are
presented and compared with the classic Least Squares Method demonstrating the
potentiality of the proposed approach in terms of precision and reliability."
"Frictional influences in tendon-driven robotic systems are generally
unwanted, with efforts towards minimizing them where possible. In the human
hand however, the tendon-pulley system is found to be frictional with a
difference between high-loaded static post-eccentric and post-concentric force
production of 9-12% of the total output force. This difference can be directly
attributed to tendon-pulley friction. Exploiting this phenomenon for robotic
and prosthetic applications we can achieve a reduction of actuator size, weight
and consequently energy consumption. In this study, we present the design of a
bio-inspired friction switch. The adaptive pulley is designed to minimize the
influence of frictional forces under low and medium-loading conditions and
maximize it under high-loading conditions. This is achieved with a
dual-material system that consists of a high-friction silicone substrate and
low-friction polished steel pins. The system, designed to switch its frictional
properties between the low-loaded and high-loaded conditions, is described and
its behavior experimentally validated with respect to the number and spacing of
pins. The results validate its intended behavior, making it a viable choice for
robotic tendon-driven systems."
"Evidential grids have recently shown interesting properties for mobile object
perception. Evidential grids are a generalisation of Bayesian occupancy grids
using Dempster- Shafer theory. In particular, these grids can handle
efficiently partial information. The novelty of this article is to propose a
perception scheme enhanced by geo-referenced maps used as an additional source
of information, which is fused with a sensor grid. The paper presents the key
stages of such a data fusion process. An adaptation of conjunctive combination
rule is presented to refine the analysis of the conflicting information. The
method uses temporal accumulation to make the distinction between stationary
and mobile objects, and applies contextual discounting for modelling
information obsolescence. As a result, the method is able to better
characterise the occupied cells by differentiating, for instance, moving
objects, parked cars, urban infrastructure and buildings. Experiments carried
out on real- world data illustrate the benefits of such an approach."
"The kinematics recursive equation was built by using the modified D-H method
after the structure of rehabilitation lower extremity exoskeleton was analyzed.
The numerical algorithm of inverse kinematics was given too. Then the
three-dimensional simulation model of the exoskeleton robot was built using
MATLAB software, based on the model, 3D reappearance of a complete gait was
achieved. Finally, the reliability of numerical algorithm of inverse kinematics
was verified by the simulation result. All jobs above lay a foundation for
developing a three-dimensional simulation platform of exoskeleton robot."
"Positioning 3R manipulators may have two or four inverse kinematic solutions
(IKS). This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition for 3R
positioning manipulators with orthogonal joint axes to have four distinct IKS.
We show that the transition between manipulators with 2 and 4 IKS is defined by
the set of manipulators with a quadruple root of their inverse kinematics. The
resulting condition is explicit and states that the last link length of the
manipulator must be greater than a quantity that depends on three of its
remaining DH-parameters. This result is of interest for the design of new
manipulators."
"In the industry, numerous commercial packages provide tools to introduce, and
analyse human behaviour in the product's environment (for maintenance,
ergonomics...), thanks to Virtual Humans. We will focus on control. Thanks to
algorithms newly introduced in recent research papers, we think we can provide
an implementation, which even widens, and simplifies the animation capacities
of virtual manikins. In order to do so, we are going to express the industrial
expectations as for Virtual Humans, without considering feasibility (not to
bias the issue). The second part will show that no commercial application
provides the tools that perfectly meet the needs. Thus we propose a new
animation framework that better answers the problem. Our contribution is the
integration - driven by need ~ of available new scientific techniques to
animate Virtual Humans, in a new control scheme that better answers industrial
expectations."
"This paper describes a set of experiments involving small helicopters landing
automated landing at unusual attitudes. By leveraging the increased agility of
small air vehicles, we show that it is possible to automatically land a small
helicopter on surfaces pitched at angles up to 60 degrees. Such maneuvers
require considerable agility from the vehicle and its avionics system, and they
pose significant technical and safety challenges. Our work builds upon previous
activities in human-inspired, high-agility flight for small rotorcraft.
However, it was not possible to leverage manual flight test data to extract
landing maneuvers due to stringent attitude and position control requirements.
Availability of low-cost, local navigation systems requiring no on-board
instrumentation has proven particularly important for these experiments to be
successful."
"Because of the communication delay between earth and moon, the GNC technology
of lunar probe is becoming more important than ever. Current navigation
technology is not able to provide precise motion estimation for probe landing
control system Computer vision offers a new approach to solve this problem. In
this paper, author introduces an image process algorithm of computer vision
navigation for autonomous landing of lunar probe. The purpose of the algorithm
is to detect and track feature points which are factors of navigation. Firstly,
fixation areas are detected as sub-images and matched. Secondly, feature points
are extracted from sub-images and tracked. Computer simulation demonstrates the
result of algorithm takes less computation and fulfils requests of navigation
algorithm."
"Field trial is very critical and high risk in autonomous UAV development life
cycle. Hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation is a computer simulation that has
the ability to simulate UAV flight characteristic, sensor modeling and actuator
modeling while communicating in real time with the UAV autopilot hardware. HIL
simulation can be used to test the UAV autopilot hardware reliability, test the
closed loop performance of the overall system and tuning the control parameter.
By rigorous testing in the HIL simulator, the risk in the field trial can be
minimized."
"The influences of the leader in a group of V flight formation are dealt with.
The investigation is focused on the effect of its position and shape on
aerodynamics performances of a given V flight formation. Vortices generated the
wing tip of the leader moves downstream forming a pair of opposite rotating
line vortices. These vortices are generally undesirable because they create a
downwash that increases the induced drag on leaders wing. However, this
downwash is also accompanied by an upwash that can beneficial to the followers
wing flying behind the leaders one, namely a favorable lift for the followers
wing. How much contributions of the leaders wing to the followers wing in the V
formation flight is determined by the strength of tip vortices generated by the
leaders wing which is influenced by its position and shape including incidence
angle, dihedral angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio. The prediction of
aerodynamic performances of the V flight formation including lift, drag and
moment coefficients is numerically performed by solving Navier Stokes equations
with k e turbulence model. The computational domain is defined with multiblock
topology to capture the complex geometry arrangement of the V flight formation."
"This paper proposes an autopilot system that can be used to control the small
scale rotorcraft during the flight test for linear-frequency-domain system
identification. The input frequency swept is generated automatically as part of
the autopilot control command. Therefore the bandwidth coverage and consistency
of the frequency swept is guaranteed to produce high quality data for system
identification. Beside that we can set the safety parameter during the flight
test (maximum roll or pitch value, minimum altitude, etc) so the safety of the
whole flight test is guaranteed. This autopilot for automated flight test will
be tested using hardware in the loop simulator for hover flight condition."
"This paper presents one approach in designing a Fire Fighting Robot which has
been contested annually in a robotic student competition in many countries
following the rules initiated at the Trinity College. The approach makes use of
computer simulation and animation in a virtual reality environment. In the
simulation, the amount of time, starting from home until the flame is
destroyed, can be confirmed. The efficacy of algorithms and parameter values
employed can be easily evaluated. Rather than spending time building the real
robot in a trial and error fashion, now students can explore more variation of
algorithm, parameter and sensor-actuator configuration in the early stage of
design. Besides providing additional excitement during learning process and
enhancing students understanding to the engineering aspects of the design, this
approach could become a useful tool to increase the chance of winning the
contest."
"In recent years, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (UAV) research and development
at Bandung Institute of Technology in Indonesia has achieved the testing stage
in the field. This testing was still being classified as the early testing,
since some of the preliminary tests were carried out in the scale of the
laboratory. The paper would discuss the laboratory test and several tests that
were done in the field. Discussions were stressed in the procedure and the aim
that will be achieved, along with several early results. The testing was
carried out in the lake with the area around 8300 Ha and the maximum depth of
50 meters. The location of the testing was chosen with consideration of
minimizing the effect of the current and the wave, as well as the location that
was not too far from the Laboratory. The type of testing that will be discussed
in paper was Heading Lock Maneuver Testing. The vehicle was tested to move with
a certain cruising speed, afterwards it was commanded by an arbitrarily
selected heading direction. The response and the behavior of the vehicle were
recorded as the data produced by the testing."
"This paper presents our experience in developing and implementing Internet
telerobotics system. Internet telerobotics system refers to a robot system
controlled and monitored remotely through the Internet. A robot manipulator
with five degrees of freedom, called Mentor, is employed. Client-server
architecture is chosen as a platform for our Internet telerobotics system.
Three generations of telerobotics systems have evolved in this research. The
first generation was based on CGI and two tiered architecture, where a client
presents a Graphical User Interface to the user, and utilizes the user's data
entry and actions to perform requests to robot server running on a different
machine. The second generation was developed using Java. We also employ Java 3D
for creating and manipulating 3D geometry of manipulator links and for
constructing the structures used in rendering that geometry, resulting in 3D
robot movement simulation presented to the users(clients) through their web
browser. Recent development in our Internet telerobotics includes object
recognition through image captured by a camera, which poses challenging
problem, given the undeterministic latency of the Internet. The third
generation is centered around the use of CORBA for development platform of
distributed internet telerobotics system, aimed at distributing task of
telerobotics system."
"This research will proposed a new kind of relatively low cost autonomous UAV
that will enable farmers to make just in time mosaics of aerial photo of their
crop. These mosaics of aerial photo should be able to be produced with
relatively low cost and within the 24 hours of acquisition constraint. The
autonomous UAV will be equipped with payload management system specifically
developed for rapid aerial mapping. As mentioned before turn around time is the
key factor, so accuracy is not the main focus (not orthorectified aerial
mapping). This system will also be equipped with special software to post
process the aerial photos to produce the mosaic aerial photo map"
"The establishment of global helicopter linear model is very precious and
useful for the design of the linear control laws, since it is never afforded in
the published literatures. In the first principle approach, the mathematical
model was developed using basic helicopter theory accounting for particular
characteristic of the miniature helicopter. No formal system identification
procedures are required for the proposed model structure. The relevant
published literatures however did not present the linear models required for
the design of linear control laws. The paper presents a step by step
development of linear model for small scale helicopter based on first-principle
approach. Beyond the previous work in literatures, the calculation of the
stability derivatives is presented in detail. A computer program is used to
solve the equilibrium conditions and then calculate the change in aerodynamics
forces and moments due to the change in each degree of freedom and control
input. The detail derivation allows the comprehensive analysis of relative
dominance of vehicle states and input variables to force and moment components.
Hence it facilitates the development of minimum complexity small scale
helicopter dynamics model."
"A model helicopter is more difficult to control than its full scale
counterparts. This is due to its greater sensitivity to control inputs and
disturbances as well as higher bandwidth of dynamics. This works is focused on
designing practical tracking controller for a small scale helicopter following
predefined trajectories. A tracking controller based on optimal control theory
is synthesized as part of the development of an autonomous helicopter. Some
issues in regards to control constraints are addressed. The weighting between
state tracking performance and control power expenditure is analyzed. Overall
performance of the control design is evaluated based on its time domain
histories of trajectories as well as control inputs."
"This paper presents the design, fabrication, and experimental
characterization of a peristaltic micropump. The micropump is composed of two
layers fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material. The first layer
has a rectangular channel and two valve seals. Three rectangular mini
lightweight piezo-composite actuators are integrated in the second layer, and
used as actuation parts. Two layers are bonded, and covered by two polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) plates, which help increase the stiffness of the micropump.
A maximum flow rate of 900 mokroliter per min and a maximum backpressure of 1.8
kPa are recorded when water is used as pump liquid. We measured the power
consumption of the micropump. The micropump is found to be a promising
candidate for bio-medical application due to its bio-compatibility,
portability, bidirectionality, and simple effective design."
"asteroids or comets have received remarkable attention in the world. In small
body explorations, especially, detailed in-situ surface exploration by tiny
rover is one of effective and fruitful means and is expected to make strong
contributions towards scientific studies. JAXA ISAS is promoting MUSES C
mission, which is the worlds first sample and return attempt to or from the
near earth asteroid. Hayabusa spacecraft in MUSES C mission took the tiny
rover, which was expected to perform the in-situ surface exploration by
hopping. This paper describes the system design, mobility and intelligence of
the developed unmanned explorer. This paper also presents the ground
experimental results and the flight results."
"For the tracking stage path planning, we design a two-axis cross-coupling
control system which uses the PI controller to compensate the contour error
between axes. In this paper, the stage adoptive is designed by our laboratory
(Precision Machine Center of National Formosa University). The cross-coupling
controller calculates the actuating signal of each axis by combining multi-axes
position error. Hence, the cross-coupling controller improves the stage
tracking ability and decreases the contour error. The experiments show
excellent stage motion. This finding confirms that the proposed method is a
powerful and efficient tool for improving stage tracking ability. Also found
were the stages tracking to minimize contour error of two types circular to
approximately 25nm."
"In this paper, a model of a pair of Dubins vehicles is considered. The
vehicles move from an initial position and orientation to final position and
orientation. A long the motion, the two vehicles are not allowed to collide
however the two vehicles cant to far each other. The optimal control of the
vehicle is found using the Pontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP). This PMP leads
to a Hamiltonian system consisting of a system of differential equation and its
adjoint. The originally differential equation has initial and final condition
but the adjoint system doesn't have one. The classical difficulty is solved
numerically by the greatest gradient descent method. Some simulation results
are presented in this paper."
"Simulation results on dynamic yaw stability derivatives of a gull bird by
means of computational fluid dynamics are presented. Two different kinds of
motions are used for determining the dynamic yaw stability derivatives CNr and
CNbeta . Concerning the first one, simple lateral translation and yaw rotary
motions in yaw are considered. The second one consists of combined motions. To
determine dynamic yaw stability derivatives of the bird, the simulation of an
unsteady flow with a bird model showing a harmonic motion is performed. The
unsteady flow solution for each time step is obtained by solving unsteady Euler
equations based on a finite volume approach for a smaller reduced frequency.
Then, an evaluation of unsteady forces and moments for one cycle is conducted
using harmonic Fourier analysis. The results on the dynamic yaw stability
derivatives for both simulations of the model motion show a good agreement."
"In this paper, a wavelet-based iterative learning control (WILC) scheme with
Fuzzy PD feedback is presented for a pneumatic control system with nonsmooth
nonlinearities and uncertain parameters. The wavelet transform is employed to
extract the learnable dynamics from measured output signal before it can be
used to update the control profile. The wavelet transform is adopted to
decompose the original signal into many low-resolution signals that contain the
learnable and unlearnable parts. The desired control profile is then compared
with the learnable part of the transformed signal. Thus, the effects from
unlearnable dynamics on the controlled system can be attenuated by a Fuzzy PD
feedback controller. As for the rules of Fuzzy PD controller in the feedback
loop, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search for the inference rules of
optimization. A proportional-valve controlled pneumatic cylinder actuator
system is used as the control target for simulation. Simulation results have
shown a much-improved positiontracking performance."
"This paper presents the positive real analysis and synthesis for Networked
Control Systems (NCS) in discrete time. Based on the definition of passivity,
the sufficient condition of NCS is given by stochastic Lyapunov functional. The
controller via state feedback is designed to guarantee the stability of NCS and
closed-loop positive realness. It is shown that a mode-dependent positive real
controller exists if a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities has solutions.
The controller can be then constructed in terms of the solutions."
"This paper presents how to use feedback controller with helicopter dynamics
state space model. A simplified analysis is presented for controller design
using LQR of small scale helicopters for axial and forward flights. Our
approach is simple and gives the basic understanding about how to develop
controller for solving the stability of linear helicopter flight dynamics."
"We present here a novel, cost-effective method for increasing and controlling
the ortho para H2 (o p H2) conversion yield. First, we invoke two processes
derived from fundamental, surface science insights, based on the effect of
molecular orientation on the hydrogen solid surface reaction, i.e., dynamical
quantum filtering and steering, and apply them to enhance the o p H2 conversion
yield. Second, we find an important factor that can significantly influence the
yield i.e., inhomogeneity of spin density distribution. This factor gives us a
promising possibility to increase the yield and to find the best catalyst e.g.,
design of materials that can function as catalysts for the o p H2 conversion."
"In general, most of communication satellites were designed to be operated in
geostationary orbit. And many of them were designed in prolate dual-spin
configuration. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, they have to be stabilized
against their internal energy dissipation effect. Several countries that
located in southern hemisphere, has shown interest to use communication
satellite. Because of those countries southern latitude, an idea emerged to
incline the communication satellite (due to its prolate dualspin configuration)
in elliptical orbit. This work is focused on designing Attitude Stability
System for prolate dual-spin satellite in the effect of perturbed field of
gravity due to the inclination of its elliptical orbit. DANDE (De-spin Active
Nutation Damping Electronics) provides primary stabilization method for the
satellite in its orbit. Classical Control Approach is used for the iteration of
DANDE parameters. The control performance is evaluated based on time response
analysis."
"In response to the interest to re-use Palapa B2R satellite nearing its End of
Life (EOL) time, an idea to incline the satellite orbit in order to cover a new
region has emerged in the recent years. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, Palapa
B2R has to be stabilized against its internal energy dissipation effect. This
work is focused on analyzing the dynamics of the reusable satellite in its
inclined orbit. The study discusses in particular the stability of the prolate
dual-spin satellite under the effect of perturbed field of gravitation due to
the inclination of its elliptical orbit. Palapa B2R physical data was
substituted into the dual-spin's equation of motion. The coefficient of zonal
harmonics J2 was induced into the gravity-gradient moment term that affects the
satellite attitude. The satellite's motion and attitude were then simulated in
the perturbed gravitational field by J2, with the variation of orbit's
eccentricity and inclination. The analysis of the satellite dynamics and its
stability was conducted for designing a control system for the vehicle in its
new inclined orbit."
"A mini scale helicopter exhibits not only increased sensitivity to control
inputs and disturbances, but also higher bandwidth of its dynamics. These
properties make model helicopters, as a flying robot, more difficult to
control. The dynamics model accuracy will determine the performance of the
designed controller. It is attractive in this regards to have a controller that
can accommodate the unmodeled dynamics or parameter changes and perform well in
such situations. Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) is chosen as the candidate to
synthesize such a controller due to its simplicity and convenience in
demonstrating integrated performance measures including equivalent time
constant, stability indices and robustness. In this study, CDM is implemented
for a design of multivariable controller for a small scale helicopter during
hover and cruise flight. In the synthesis of MIMO CDM, good design common sense
based on hands-on experience is necessary. The low level controller algorithm
is designed as part of hybrid supervisory control architecture to be
implemented on an onboard computer system. Its feasibility and performance are
evaluated based on its robustness, desired time domain system responses and
compliance to hard-real time requirements."
"The last decade has witnessed increasing worldwide interest in the research
of underwater robotics with particular focus on the area of autonomous
underwater vehicles (AUVs). The underwater robotics technology has enabled
human to access the depth of the ocean to conduct environmental surveys,
resources mapping as well as scientific and military missions. This capability
is especially valuable for countries with major water or oceanic resources. As
an archipelagic nation with more than 13,000 islands, Indonesia has one of the
most abundant living and non-organic oceanic resources. The needs for the
mapping, exploration, and environmental preservation of the vast marine
resources are therefore imperative. The challenge of the deep water exploration
has been the complex issues associated with hazardous and unstructured undersea
and sea-bed environments. The paper reports the design, development and testing
efforts of underwater vehicle that have been conducted at Institut Teknologi
Bandung. Key technology areas have been identified and step-by-step development
is presented in conjunction with the need to meet the challenge of underwater
vehicle operation. A number of future research directions are also highlighted."
"A rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle exhibits more complex properties
compared to its full-size counterparts due to its increased sensitivity to
control inputs and disturbances and higher bandwidth of its dynamics. As an
aerial vehicle with vertical take-off and landing capability, the helicopter
specifically poses a difficult problem of transition between forward flight and
unstable hover and vice versa. The LPV control technique explicitly takes into
account the change in performance due to the real-time parameter variations.
The technique therefore theoretically guarantees the performance and robustness
over the entire operating envelope. In this study, we investigate a new
approach implementing model identification for use in the LPV control
framework. The identification scheme employs recursive least square technique
implemented on the LPV system represented by dynamics of helicopter during a
transition. The airspeed as the scheduling of parameter trajectory is not
assumed to vary slowly. The exclusion of slow parameter change requirement
allows for the application of the algorithm for aggressive maneuvering
capability without the need of expensive computation. The technique is tested
numerically and will be validated in the autonomous flight of a small scale
helicopter."
"The control of small-scale helicopter is a MIMO problem. To use of classical
control approach to formally solve a MIMO problem, one needs to come up with
multidimensional Root Locus diagram to tune the control parameters. The problem
with the required dimension of the RL diagram for MIMO design has forced the
design procedure of classical approach to be conducted in cascaded multi-loop
SISO system starting from the innermost loop outward. To implement this control
approach for a helicopter, a pitch and roll attitude control system is often
subordinated to a, respectively, longitudinal and lateral velocity control
system in a nested architecture. The requirement for this technique to work is
that the inner attitude control loop must have a higher bandwidth than the
outer velocity control loop which is not the case for high performance mini
helicopter. To address the above problems, an algebraic design approach is
proposed in this work. The designed control using s-CDM approach is
demonstrated for hovering control of small-scale helicopter simultaneously
subjected to plant parameter uncertainties and wind disturbances."
"The paper presents a new stiffness modeling method for overconstrained
parallel manipulators with flexible links and compliant actuating joints. It is
based on a multidimensional lumped-parameter model that replaces the link
flexibility by localized 6-dof virtual springs that describe both
translational/rotational compliance and the coupling between them. In contrast
to other works, the method involves a FEA-based link stiffness evaluation and
employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations for the unloaded
manipulator configuration, which allows computing the stiffness matrix for the
overconstrained architectures, including singular manipulator postures. The
advantages of the developed technique are confirmed by application examples,
which deal with comparative stiffness analysis of two translational parallel
manipulators of 3-PUU and 3-PRPaR architectures. Accuracy of the proposed
approach was evaluated for a case study, which focuses on stiffness analysis of
Orthoglide parallel manipulator."
"Recursive modelling for the kinematics of a 3-PRP planar parallel robot is
presented in this paper. Three planar chains connecting to the moving platform
of the manipulator are located in a vertical plane. Knowing the motion of the
platform, we develop the inverse kinematics and determine the positions,
velocities and accelerations of the robot. Several matrix equations offer
iterative expressions and graphs for the displacements, velocities and
accelerations of three prismatic actuators."
"Human interaction introduces two main constraints: Safety and Comfort.
Therefore service robot manipulator can't be controlled like industrial robotic
manipulator where personnel is isolated from the robot's work envelope. In this
paper, we present a soft motion trajectory planner to try to ensure that these
constraints are satisfied. This planner can be used on-line to establish visual
and force control loop suitable in presence of human. The cubic trajectories
build by this planner are good candidates as output of a manipulation task
planner. The obtained system is then homogeneous from task planning to robot
control. The soft motion trajectory planner limits jerk, acceleration and
velocity in cartesian space using quaternion. Experimental results carried out
on a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE arm are presented."
"The basic idea behind evolutionary robotics is to evolve a set of neural
controllers for a particular task at hand. It involves use of various input
parameters such as infrared sensors, light sensors and vision based methods.
This paper aims to explore the evolution of vision based navigation in a mobile
robot. It discusses in detail the effect of different field of views for a
mobile robot. The individuals have been evolved using different FOV values and
the results have been recorded and analyzed.The optimum values for FOV have
been proposed after evaluating more than 100 different values. It has been
observed that the optimum FOV value requires lesser number of generations for
evolution and the mobile robot trained with that particular value is able to
navigate well in the environment."
"We introduce a problem in which a service vehicle seeks to guard a deadline
(boundary) from dynamically arriving mobile targets. The environment is a
rectangle and the deadline is one of its edges. Targets arrive continuously
over time on the edge opposite the deadline, and move towards the deadline at a
fixed speed. The goal for the vehicle is to maximize the fraction of targets
that are captured before reaching the deadline. We consider two cases; when the
service vehicle is faster than the targets, and; when the service vehicle is
slower than the targets. In the first case we develop a novel vehicle policy
based on computing longest paths in a directed acyclic graph. We give a lower
bound on the capture fraction of the policy and show that the policy is optimal
when the distance between the target arrival edge and deadline becomes very
large. We present numerical results which suggest near optimal performance away
from this limiting regime. In the second case, when the targets are slower than
the vehicle, we propose a policy based on servicing fractions of the
translational minimum Hamiltonian path. In the limit of low target speed and
high arrival rate, the capture fraction of this policy is within a small
constant factor of the optimal."
"In this paper we present a method for automatically generating optimal robot
trajectories satisfying high level mission specifications. The motion of the
robot in the environment is modeled as a general transition system, enhanced
with weighted transitions. The mission is specified by a general linear
temporal logic formula. In addition, we require that an optimizing proposition
must be repeatedly satisfied. The cost function that we seek to minimize is the
maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. For
every environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robot
trajectory which minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated by
applications in robotic monitoring and data gathering. In this setting, the
optimizing proposition is satisfied at all locations where data can be
uploaded, and the entire formula specifies a complex (and infinite horizon)
data collection mission. Our method utilizes B\""uchi automata to produce an
automaton (which can be thought of as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporal
logic specification. We then present a graph algorithm which computes a path
corresponding to the optimal robot trajectory. We also present an
implementation for a robot performing a data gathering mission in a road
network."
"This paper addresses object perception applied to mobile robotics. Being able
to perceive semantically meaningful objects in unstructured environments is a
key capability in order to make robots suitable to perform high-level tasks in
home environments. However, finding a solution for this task is daunting: it
requires the ability to handle the variability in image formation in a moving
camera with tight time constraints. The paper brings to attention some of the
issues with applying three state of the art object recognition and detection
methods in a mobile robotics scenario, and proposes methods to deal with
windowing/segmentation. Thus, this work aims at evaluating the state-of-the-art
in object perception in an attempt to develop a lightweight solution for mobile
robotics use/research in typical indoor settings."
"We present a complete characterization of shortest paths to a goal position
for a vehicle with unicycle kinematics and a limited range sensor, constantly
keeping a given landmark in sight. Previous work on this subject studied the
optimal paths in case of a frontal, symmetrically limited Field--Of--View
(FOV). In this paper we provide a generalization to the case of arbitrary FOVs,
including the case that the direction of motion is not an axis of symmetry for
the FOV, and even that it is not contained in the FOV. The provided solution is
of particular relevance to applications using side-scanning, such as e.g. in
underwater sonar-based surveying and navigation."
"We consider the eigenvalue problem for the case where the input matrix is
symmetric and its entries perturb in some given intervals. We present a
characterization of some of the exact boundary points, which allows us to
introduce an inner approximation algorithm, that in many case estimates exact
bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that is able to guaran-
tee exactness. We illustrate our approach by several examples and numerical
experiments."
"Understanding object and its context are very important for robots when
dealing with objects for completion of a mission. In this paper, an
Affordance-based Ontology (ABO) is proposed for easy robot dealing with
substantive and non-substantive objects. An ABO is a machine-understandable
representation of objects and their relationships by what it's related to and
how it's related. By using ABO, when dealing with a substantive object, robots
can understand the representation of its object and its relation with other
non-substantive objects. When the substantive object is not available, the
robots have the understanding ability, in term of objects and their functions
to select a non substantive object in order to complete the mission, such as
giving raincoat or hat instead of getting stuck due to the unavailability of
substantive object, e.g. umbrella. The experiment is done in the Ubiquitous
Robotics Technology (u-RT) Space of National Institute of Advanced Industrial
Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan."
"The optimal disturbance rejection control problem is considered for consensus
tracking systems affected by external persistent disturbances and noise.
Optimal estimated values of system states are obtained by recursive filtering
for the multiple autonomous underwater vehicles modeled to multi-agent systems
with Kalman filter. Then the feedforward-feedback optimal control law is
deduced by solving the Riccati equations and matrix equations. The existence
and uniqueness condition of feedforward-feedback optimal control law is
proposed and the optimal control law algorithm is carried out. Lastly,
simulations show the result is effectiveness with respect to external
persistent disturbances and noise."
"Sensor fusion of multiple sources plays an important role in vehicular
systems to achieve refined target position and velocity estimates. In this
article, we address the general registration problem, which is a key module for
a fusion system to accurately correct systematic errors of sensors. A fast
maximum a posteriori (FMAP) algorithm for joint registration-tracking (JRT) is
presented. The algorithm uses a recursive two-step optimization that involves
orthogonal factorization to ensure numerically stability. Statistical
efficiency analysis based on Cram\`{e}r-Rao lower bound theory is presented to
show asymptotical optimality of FMAP. Also, Givens rotation is used to derive a
fast implementation with complexity O(n) with $n$ the number of tracked
targets. Simulations and experiments are presented to demonstrate the promise
and effectiveness of FMAP."
"This paper investigates the use of depth images as localisation sensors for
3D map building. The localisation information is derived from the 3D data
thanks to the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. The covariance of the
ICP, and thus of the localization error, is analysed, and described by a Fisher
Information Matrix. It is advocated this error can be much reduced if the data
is fused with measurements from other motion sensors, or even with prior
knowledge on the motion. The data fusion is performed by a recently introduced
specific extended Kalman filter, the so-called Invariant EKF, and is directly
based on the estimated covariance of the ICP. The resulting filter is very
natural, and is proved to possess strong properties. Experiments with a Kinect
sensor and a three-axis gyroscope prove clear improvement in the accuracy of
the localization, and thus in the accuracy of the built 3D map."
"This paper presents a visual tracking system that is capable or running real
time on-board a small UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The tracking system is
computationally efficient and invariant to lighting changes and rotation of the
object or the camera. Detection and tracking is autonomously carried out on the
payload computer and there are two different methods for creation of the image
patches. The first method starts detecting and tracking using a stored image
patch created prior to flight with previous flight data. The second method
allows the operator on the ground to select the interest object for the UAV to
track. The tracking system is capable of re-detecting the object of interest in
the events of tracking failure. Performance of the tracking system was verified
both in the lab and during actual flights of the UAV. Results show that the
system can run on-board and track a diverse set of objects in real time."
"The work reported in this paper is motivated towards the development of a
mathematical model for swarm systems based on macroscopic primitives. A pattern
formation and transformation model is proposed. The pattern transformation
model comprises two general methods for pattern transformation, namely a
macroscopic transformation and mathematical transformation method. The problem
of transformation is formally expressed and four special cases of
transformation are considered. Simulations to confirm the feasibility of the
proposed models and transformation methods are presented. Comparison between
the two transformation methods is also reported."
"We present an intelligent interactive nightstand mounted on a mobile robot,
to aid the elderly in their homes using physical, tactile and visual percepts.
We show the integration of three different sensing modalities for controlling
the navigation of a robot mounted nightstand within the constrained environment
of a general purpose living room housing a single aging individual in need of
assistance and monitoring. A camera mounted on the ceiling of the room, gives a
top-down view of the obstacles, the person and the nightstand. Pressure sensors
mounted beneath the bed-stand of the individual provide physical perception of
the person's state. A proximity IR sensor on the nightstand acts as a tactile
interface along with a Wii Nunchuck (Nintendo) to control mundane operations on
the nightstand. Intelligence from these three modalities are combined to enable
path planning for the nightstand to approach the individual. With growing
emphasis on assistive technology for the aging individuals who are increasingly
electing to stay in their homes, we show how ubiquitous intelligence can be
brought inside homes to help monitor and provide care to an individual. Our
approach goes one step towards achieving pervasive intelligence by seamlessly
integrating different sensors embedded in the fabric of the environment."
"We consider the problem of coordinating a collection of robots at an
intersection area taking into account dynamical constraints due to actuator
limitations. We adopt the coordination space approach, which is standard in
multiple robot motion planning. Assuming the priorities between robots are
assigned in advance and the existence of a collision-free trajectory respecting
those priorities, we propose a provably safe trajectory planner satisfying
kinodynamic constraints. The algorithm is shown to run in real time and to
return safe (collision-free) trajectories. Simulation results on synthetic data
illustrate the benefits of the approach."
"We present a robotic exploration technique in which the goal is to learn to a
visual model and be able to distinguish between different terrains and other
visual components in an unknown environment. We use ROST, a realtime online
spatiotemporal topic modeling framework to model these terrains using the
observations made by the robot, and then use an information theoretic path
planning technique to define the exploration path. We conduct experiments with
aerial view and underwater datasets with millions of observations and varying
path lengths, and find that paths that are biased towards locations with high
topic perplexity produce better terrain models with high discriminative power,
especially with paths of length close to the diameter of the world."

"Sampling-based motion planners have proven to be efficient solutions to a
variety of high-dimensional, geometrically complex motion planning problems
with applications in several domains. The traditional view of these approaches
is that they solve challenges efficiently by giving up formal guarantees and
instead attain asymptotic properties in terms of completeness and optimality.
Recent work has argued based on Monte Carlo experiments that these approaches
also exhibit desirable probabilistic properties in terms of completeness and
optimality after finite computation. The current paper formalizes these
guarantees. It proves a formal bound on the probability that solutions returned
by asymptotically optimal roadmap-based methods (e.g., PRM*) are within a bound
of the optimal path length I* with clearance {\epsilon} after a finite
iteration n. This bound has the form P(|In - I* | {\leq} {\delta}I*) {\leq}
Psuccess, where {\delta} is an error term for the length a path in the PRM*
graph, In. This bound is proven for general dimension Euclidean spaces and
evaluated in simulation. A discussion on how this bound can be used in
practice, as well as bounds for sparse roadmaps are also provided."
"Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are popular in motion planning because
they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s)
extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so
asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in
the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also
inconsistent with their single-query nature.
  For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can
improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that
unless this subset is sampled directly, the probability of improving a solution
becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this
paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this
subset.
  The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a
new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic
guarantees on completeness and optimality as RRT* while improving the
convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a
simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced
path-planning algorithms. We show experimentally that it outperforms RRT* in
rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult
passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range
of the planning problem."
"Most humanoid robots have highly complicated structure and design of robots
that are very similar to human is extremely difficult. In this paper, modelling
of a general and comprehensive algorithm for control of humanoid robots is
presented using Colored Petri Nets. For keeping dynamic balance of the robot,
combination of Gyroscope and Accelerometer sensors are used in algorithm. Image
processing is used to identify two fundamental issues: first, detection of
target or an object which robot must follow; second, detecting surface of the
ground so that walking robot could maintain its balance just like a human and
shows its best performance. Presented model gives high-level view of humanoid
robot's operations."
"In order to decrease the measuring cycle time on the coordinate measuring
machine (CMM) a robot workstation for the positioning of measuring objects was
created. The application of a simple 5-axis industrial robot enables the
positioning of the objects within the working space of CMM and measuring of
different surfaces on the same object without human intervention. In this
article an upgrade of an existing robot workstation through different design
measures is shown. The main goal of this upgrade is to improve the measuring
accuracy of the complex robot-CMM system."
"Coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are widely used to check dimensions of
manufactured parts, especially in automotive industry. The major obstacles in
automation of these measurements are fixturing and clamping assemblies, which
are required in order to position the measured object within the CMM. This
paper describes how an industrial robot can be used to manipulate the measured
object within the CMM work space, in order to enable automation of complex
geometry measurement."
"Developing robot agnostic software frameworks involves synthesizing the
disparate fields of robotic theory and software engineering while
simultaneously accounting for a large variability in hardware designs and
control paradigms. As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase,
the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the
entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high,
even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in
robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and
customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic
applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices
found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an
open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1)
quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2)
automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its
components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt!
is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing
standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific
configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These
best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles
applicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry
barrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against
our design objectives for their effectiveness to users."
"This paper presents a novel feedback method on the motion planning for
unicycle robots in environments with static obstacles, along with an extension
to the distributed planning and coordination in multi-robot systems. The method
employs a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, whose integral curves
exhibit various patterns depending on the value of a parameter lambda. More
specifically, for an a priori known value of lambda, the vector field has a
unique singular point of dipole type and can be used to steer the unicycle to a
goal configuration. Furthermore, for the unique value of lambda that the vector
field has a continuum of singular points, the integral curves are used to
define flows around obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan can then
be constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields in a
static obstacle environment. The method does not suffer from the appearance of
sinks (stable nodes) away from goal point. Compared to other similar methods
which are free of local minima, the proposed approach does not require any
parameter tuning to render the desired convergence properties. The paper also
addresses the extension of the method to the distributed coordination and
control of multiple robots, where each robot needs to navigate to a goal
configuration while avoiding collisions with the remaining robots, and while
using local information only. More specifically, based on the results which
apply to the single-robot case, a motion coordination protocol is presented
which guarantees the safety of the multi-robot system and the almost global
convergence of the robots to their goal configurations. The efficacy of the
proposed methodology is demonstrated via simulation results in static and
dynamic environments."
"Industrial high speed laser operations the use of delta parallel robots
potentially offers many benefits due to their structural stiffness and limited
moving masses. This paper deals with a particular Delta, developed for high
speed laser cutting. Parallel delta robot has numerous advantages in comparison
with serial robots Higher stiffness and connected with that a lower mass of
links the possibility of transporting heavier loads, and higher accuracy. The
main drawback is however a smaller workspace. Hence there exists an interest
for the research concerning the workspace of robots.In industrial cutting tool

progress was very fast and at present time every year over 3000 laser cutting
machines is installed in the world. Laser cutting is one of the largest
applications of lasers in metal working industry."
"This work proposes a method for effectively computing manipulation paths to
rearrange similar objects in a cluttered space. The solution can be used to
place similar products in a factory floor in a desirable arrangement or for
retrieving a particular object from a shelf blocked by similarly sized objects.
These are challenging problems as they involve combinatorially large,
continuous configuration spaces due to the presence of multiple moving bodies
and kinematically complex manipulators. This work leverages ideas from
algorithmic theory, multi-robot motion planning and manipulation planning to
propose appropriate graphical representations for this challenge. These
representations allow to quickly reason whether manipulation paths allow the
transition between entire sets of objects arrangements without having to
explicitly enumerate the path for each pair of arrangements. The proposed
method also allows to take advantage of precomputation given a manipulation
roadmap for transferring a single object in the same cluttered space. The
resulting approach is evaluated in simulation for a realistic model of a Baxter
robot and executed in open-loop on the real system, showing that the approach
solves complex instances and is promising in terms of scalability and success
ratio."
"Inertial measurement unit (IMU) and odometer have been commonly-used sensors
for autonomous land navigation in the global positioning system (GPS)-denied
scenarios. This paper systematically proposes a versatile strategy for
self-contained land vehicle navigation using the IMU and an odometer.
Specifically, the paper proposes a self-calibration and refinement method for
IMU/odometer integration that is able to overcome significant variation of the
misalignment parameters, which are induced by many inevitable and adverse
factors such as load changing, refueling and ambient temperature. An
odometer-aided IMU in-motion alignment algorithm is also devised that enables
the first-responsive functionality even when the vehicle is running freely. The
versatile strategy is successfully demonstrated and verified via long-distance
real tests."
"In this paper we consider a robot patrolling problem in which events arrive
randomly over time at the vertices of a graph. When an event arrives it remains
active for a random amount of time. If that time active exceeds a certain
threshold, then we say that the event is a true event; otherwise it is a false
event. The robot(s) can traverse the graph to detect newly arrived events, and
can revisit these events in order to classify them as true or false. The goal
is to plan robot paths that maximize the number of events that are correctly
classified, with the constraint that there are no false positives. We show that
the offline version of this problem is NP-hard. We then consider a simple
patrolling policy based on the traveling salesman tour, and characterize the
probability of correctly classifying an event. We investigate the problem when
multiple robots follow the same path, and we derive the optimal (and not
necessarily uniform) spacing between robots on the path."
"Whole-arm tactile sensing enables a robot to sense properties of contact
across its entire arm. By using this large sensing area, a robot has the
potential to acquire useful information from incidental contact that occurs
while performing a task. Within this paper, we demonstrate that data-driven
methods can be used to infer mechanical properties of objects from incidental
contact with a robot's forearm. We collected data from a tactile-sensing
forearm as it made contact with various objects during a simple reaching
motion. We then used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer two object properties
(rigid vs. soft and fixed vs. movable) based on low-dimensional features of
time-varying tactile sensor data (maximum force, contact area, and contact
motion). A key issue is the extent to which data-driven methods can generalize
to robot actions that differ from those used during training. To investigate
this issue, we developed an idealized mechanical model of a robot with a
compliant joint making contact with an object. This model provides intuition
for the classification problem. We also conducted tests in which we varied the
robot arm's velocity and joint stiffness. We found that, in contrast to our
previous methods [1], multivariate HMMs achieved high cross-validation accuracy
and successfully generalized what they had learned to new robot motions with
distinct velocities and joint stiffnesses."
"This paper presents a new methodology to craft navigation functions for
nonlinear systems with stochastic uncertainty. The method relies on the
transformation of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation into a linear
partial differential equation. This approach allows for optimality criteria to
be incorporated into the navigation function, and generalizes several existing
results in navigation functions. It is shown that the HJB and that existing
navigation functions in the literature sit on ends of a spectrum of
optimization problems, upon which tradeoffs may be made in problem complexity.
In particular, it is shown that under certain criteria the optimal navigation
function is related to Laplace's equation, previously used in the literature,
through an exponential transform. Further, analytical solutions to the HJB are
available in simplified domains, yielding guidance towards optimality for
approximation schemes. Examples are used to illustrate the role that noise, and
optimality can potentially play in navigation system design."
"This work contributes to the development of active haptic exploration
strategies of surfaces using robotic hands in environments with an unknown
structure. The architecture of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian
models, implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system. The model
pi_per perceives and discriminates different categories of materials (haptic
stimulus) integrating compliance and texture features extracted from haptic
sensory data. The model pi_tar actively infers the next region of the workspace
that should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task
information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty maps extracted
from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well as, inhibition-of-return
mechanisms.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian model pi_per can be
used to discriminate 10 different classes of materials with an average
recognition rate higher than 90% . The generalization capability of the
proposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the
simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two
regions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30
trials). The tests were performed in scenarios with 3 different configurations
of the discontinuity. The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to
manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces and sensory noise to
make correct motor decisions from haptic percepts."
"The paper deals with the problem of compliance errors compensation in
robotic-based milling. Contrary to previous works that assume that the
forces/torques generated by the manufacturing process are constant, the
interaction between the milling tool and the workpiece is modeled in details.
It takes into account the tool geometry, the number of teeth, the feed rate,
the spindle rotation speed and the properties of the material to be processed.
Due to high level of the disturbing forces/torques, the developed compensation
technique is based on the non-linear stiffness model that allows us to modify
the target trajectory taking into account nonlinearities and to avoid the
chattering effect. Illustrative example is presented that deals with
robotic-based milling of aluminum alloy."
"The paper is devoted to the accuracy improvement of robot-based milling by
using an enhanced manipulator model that takes into account both geometric and
elastostatic factors. Particular attention is paid to the model parameters
identification accuracy. In contrast to other works, the proposed approach
takes into account impact of the gravity compensator and link weights on the
manipulator elastostatic properties. In order to improve the identification
accuracy, the industry oriented performance measure is used to define optimal
measurement configurations and an enhanced partial pose measurement method is
applied for the identification of the model parameters. The advantages of the
developed approach are confirmed by experimental results that deal with the
elastostatic calibration of a heavy industrial robot used for milling. The
achieved accuracy improvement factor is about 2.4."
"The 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge afforded the golden opportunity for the
Technische Universit\""at Braunschweig to demonstrate its abilities to develop
an autonomously driving vehicle to compete with the world's best competitors.
After several stages of qualification, our team CarOLO qualified early for the
DARPA Urban Challenge Final Event and was among only eleven teams from
initially 89 competitors to compete in the final. We had the ability to work
together in a large group of experts, each contributing his expertise in his
discipline, and significant organisational, financial and technical support by
local sponsors who helped us to become the best non-US team. In this report, we
describe the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, our contribution ""Caroline"", the
technology and algorithms along with her performance in the DARPA Urban
Challenge Final Event on November 3, 2007."
"Sampling-based motion-planning algorithms typically rely on nearest-neighbor
(NN) queries when constructing a roadmap. Recent results suggest that in
various settings NN queries may be the computational bottleneck of such
algorithms. Moreover, in several asymptotically-optimal algorithms these NN
queries are of a specific form: Given a set of points and a radius r report all
pairs of points whose distance is at most r. This calls for an
application-specific NN data structure tailored to efficiently answering this
type of queries. Randomly transformed grids (RTG) were recently proposed by
Aiger et al. as a tool to answer such queries and have been shown to outperform
common implementations of NN data structures in this context. In this work we
employ RTG for sampling-based motion-planning algorithms and describe an
efficient implementation of the approach. We show that for motion-planning, RTG
allow for faster convergence to high-quality solutions when compared with
existing NN data structures. Additionally, RTG enable significantly shorter
construction times for batched-PRM variants; specifically, we demonstrate a
speedup by a factor of two to three for some scenarios."
"We introduce and study the problem in which a mobile sensing robot (our
tourist) is tasked to travel among and gather intelligence at a set of
spatially distributed point-of-interests (POIs). The quality of the information
collected at each POI is characterized by some non-decreasing reward function
over the time spent at the POI. With limited time budget, the robot must
balance between spending time traveling to POIs and spending time at POIs for
information collection (sensing) so as to maximize the total reward.
Alternatively, the robot may be required to acquire a minimum mount of reward
and hopes to do so with the least amount of time. We propose a mixed integer
programming (MIP) based anytime algorithm for solving these two NP-hard
optimization problems to arbitrary precision. The effectiveness of our
algorithm is demonstrated using an extensive set of computational experiments
including the planning of a realistic itinerary for a first-time tourist in
Istanbul."
"This paper studies the kinematic geometry of general 3-RPR planar parallel
robots with actuated base joints. These robots, while largely overlooked, have
simple direct kinematics and large singularity-free workspace. Furthermore,
their kinematic geometry is the same as that of a newly developed parallel
robot with SCARA-type motions. Starting from the direct and inverse kinematic
model, the expressions for the singularity loci of 3-RPR planar parallel robots
are determined. Then, the global behaviour at all singularities is
geometrically described by studying the degeneracy of the direct kinematic
model. Special cases of self-motions are then examined and the degree of
freedom gained in such special configurations is kinematically interpreted.
Finally, a practical example is discussed and experimental validations
performed on an actual robot prototype are presented."
This short note presents a viewpoint about medical robotics.
"An integrated software-based solution for a modular and self-independent
networked robot is introduced. The wirelessly operatable robot has been
developed mainly for autonomous monitoring works with full control over web.
The integrated software solution covers three components : a) the digital
signal processing unit for data retrieval and monitoring system; b) the
externally executable codes for control system; and c) the web programming for
interfacing the end-users with the robot. It is argued that this integrated
software-based approach is crucial to realize a flexible, modular and low
development cost mobile monitoring apparatus."
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery in urology has gained
immense popularity with the daVinci system, but a lot of research teams are
working on new robots. The purpose of this study is to review current urologic
robots and present future development directions. RECENT FINDINGS: Future
systems are expected to advance in two directions: improvements of remote
manipulation robots and developments of image-guided robots. SUMMARY: The final
goal of robots is to allow safer and more homogeneous outcomes with less
variability of surgeon performance, as well as new tools to perform tasks on
the basis of medical transcutaneous imaging, in a less invasive way, at lower
costs. It is expected that improvements for a remote system could be augmented
in reality, with haptic feedback, size reduction, and development of new tools
for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The paradigm of
image-guided robots is close to clinical availability and the most advanced
robots are presented with end-user technical assessments. It is also notable
that the potential of robots lies much further ahead than the accomplishments
of the daVinci system. The integration of imaging with robotics holds a
substantial promise, because this can accomplish tasks otherwise impossible.
Image-guided robots have the potential to offer a paradigm shift."
"This paper describes a simulator of ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies for
cancer diagnosis. When performing biopsy series, the clinician has to move the
ultrasound probe and to mentally integrate the real-time bi-dimensional images
into a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the anatomical environment.
Such a 3D representation is necessary to sample regularly the prostate in order
to maximize the probability of detecting a cancer if any. To make the training
of young physicians easier and faster we developed a simulator that combines
images computed from three-dimensional ultrasound recorded data to haptic
feedback. The paper presents the first version of this simulator."
"In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are
multiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands of each class arrive
in the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site
service that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the
vehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required
on-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by
the expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that
demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the
service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each
class. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex
combination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its
performance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the
service vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy
performs within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the optimal),
where the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of
the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service
times, and the convex combination coefficients."
"In this paper we present distributed and adaptive algorithms for motion
coordination of a group of m autonomous vehicles. The vehicles operate in a
convex environment with bounded velocity and must service demands whose time of
arrival, location and on-site service are stochastic; the objective is to
minimize the expected system time (wait plus service) of the demands. The
general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem
(m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized
a-priori task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment,
e.g. changes in load conditions; therefore, they are of limited applicability
in scenarios involving ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles operating in a
time-varying environment. First, we present a new class of policies for the
1-DTRP problem that: (i) are provably optimal both in light- and heavy-load
condition, and (ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against
changes in load conditions. Second, we show that partitioning policies, whereby
the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a
certain set of rules in its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions.
Finally, by combining the new class of algorithms for the 1-DTRP with suitable
partitioning policies, we design distributed algorithms for the m-DTRP problem
that (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to
network changes, (ii) are within a constant-factor of optimal in heavy-load
conditions and stabilize the system in any load condition. Simulation results
are presented and discussed."
"Medical robotics includes assistive devices used by the physician in order to
make his/her diagnostic or therapeutic practices easier and more efficient.
This chapter focuses on such systems. It introduces the general field of
Computer-Assisted Medical Interventions, its aims, its different components and
describes the place of robots in that context. The evolutions in terms of
general design and control paradigms in the development of medical robots are
presented and issues specific to that application domain are discussed. A view
of existing systems, on-going developments and future trends is given. A
case-study is detailed. Other types of robotic help in the medical environment
(such as for assisting a handicapped person, for rehabilitation of a patient or
for replacement of some damaged/suppressed limbs or organs) are out of the
scope of this chapter."
"The most widely applied strategy for workload sharing is to equalize the
workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multi-agent systems, this
principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies in which (i) the
workspace is divided into subregions of equal measure, (ii) there is a
bijective correspondence between agents and subregions, and (iii) each agent is
responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. In this
paper, we design provably correct, spatially-distributed and adaptive policies
that allow a team of agents to achieve a convex and equitable partition of a
convex workspace, where each subregion has the same measure. We also consider
the issue of achieving convex and equitable partitions where subregions have
shapes similar to those of regular polygons. Our approach is related to the
classic Lloyd algorithm, and exploits the unique features of power diagrams. We
discuss possible applications to routing of vehicles in stochastic and dynamic
environments. Simulation results are presented and discussed."
"Today's forging die manufacturing process must be adapted to several
evolutions in machining process generation: CAD/CAM models, CAM software
solutions and High Speed Machining (HSM). In this context, the adequacy between
die shape and HSM process is in the core of machining preparation and process
planning approaches. This paper deals with an original approach of machining
preparation integrating this adequacy in the main tasks carried out. In this
approach, the design of the machining process is based on two levels of
decomposition of the geometrical model of a given die with respect to HSM
cutting conditions (cutting speed and feed rate) and technological constrains
(tool selection, features accessibility). This decomposition assists machining
assistant to generate an HSM process. The result of this decomposition is the
identification of machining features."
"Today's High-Speed Machining (HSM) machine tool combines productivity and
part quality. The difficulty inherent in HSM operations lies in understanding
the impact of machine tool behaviour on machining time and part quality.
Analysis of some of the relevant ISO standards (230-1998, 10791-1998) and a
complementary protocol for better understanding HSM technology are presented in
the first part of this paper. These ISO standards are devoted to the procedures
implemented in order to study the behavior of machine tool. As these procedures
do not integrate HSM technology, the need for HSM machine tool tests becomes
critical to improving the trade-off between machining time and part quality. A
new protocol for analysing the HSM technology impact during circular
interpolation is presented in the second part of the paper. This protocol which
allows evaluating kinematic machine tool behaviour during circular
interpolation was designed from tests without machining. These tests are
discussed and their results analysed in the paper. During the circular
interpolation, axis capacities (such as acceleration or Jerk) related to
certain setting parameters of the numerical control unit have a significant
impact on the value of the feed rate. Consequently, a kinematic model for a
circular-interpolated trajectory was developed on the basis of these
parameters. Moreover, the link between part accuracy and kinematic machine tool
behaviour was established. The kinematic model was ultimately validated on a
bore machining simulation."
"Nowadays high speed machining (HSM) machine tool combines productivity and
part quality. So mould and die maker invested in HSM. Die and mould features
are more and more complex shaped. Thus, it is difficult to choose the best
machining strategy according to part shape. Geometrical analysis of machining
features is not sufficient to make an optimal choice. Some research show that
security, technical, functional and economical constrains must be taken into
account to elaborate a machining strategy. During complex shape machining,
production system limits induce feed rate decreases, thus loss of productivity,
in some part areas. In this paper we propose to analyse these areas by
estimating tool path quality. First we perform experiments on HSM machine tool
to determine trajectory impact on machine tool behaviour. Then, we extract
critical criteria and establish models of performance loss. Our work is focused
on machine tool kinematical performance and numerical controller unit
calculation capacity. We implement these models on Esprit CAM Software. During
machining trajectory creation, critical part areas can be visualised and
analysed. Parameters, such as, segment or arc lengths, nature of
discontinuities encountered are used to analyse critical part areas. According
to this visualisation, process development engineer should validate or modify
the trajectory."
"This paper will provide a method to decompose forging dies for machining
planning in the case of high speed machining finishing operations. This method
lies on a machining feature approach model presented in the following paper.
The two main decomposition phases, called Basic Machining Features Extraction
and Process Planning Generation, are presented. These two decomposition phases
integrates machining resources models and expert machining knowledge to provide
an outstanding process planning."
"In several fields like aeronautics, die and automotive, the machining of the
parts is done more and more on high speed machines tools. Today, the offer for
purchasing these machine tools is very wide. This situation poses the problem
of the judicious and objective choice meeting industrial needs that must be
necessary well expressed. The choice remains difficult insofar as the technical
data provided to the customers by the manufacturers of machine tools are
insufficient as well quantitatively as qualitatively. In this paper we present
a protocol for the characterization of machines tools in order to direct the
choice. The protocol is based on the one hand on no-load complementary tests to
those recommended by the standards ISO 230 and ISO 10791 and on the other hand
on the tests in load on a part test. In the first part, we present the
industrial needs as well as an analysis of the technical data of machine tools.
The second part is devoted to the study of the standards, the description of
the protocol and the presentation of the results."
"Recursive matrix relations for kinematics and dynamics of the Orthoglide
parallel robot having three concurrent prismatic actuators are established in
this paper. These are arranged according to the Cartesian coordinate system
with fixed orientation, which means that the actuating directions are normal to
each other. Three identical legs connecting to the moving platform are located
on three planes being perpendicular to each other too. Knowing the position and
the translation motion of the platform, we develop the inverse kinematics
problem and determine the position, velocity and acceleration of each element
of the robot. Further, the principle of virtual work is used in the inverse
dynamic problem. Some matrix equations offer iterative expressions and graphs
for the input forces and the powers of the three actuators."
"This paper deals with the optimal path placement for a manipulator based on
energy consumption. It proposes a methodology to determine the optimal location
of a given test path within the workspace of a manipulator with minimal
electric energy used by the actuators while taking into account the geometric,
kinematic and dynamic constraints. The proposed methodology is applied to the
Orthoglide~3-axis, a three-degree-of-freedom translational parallel kinematic
machine (PKM), as an illustrative example."
"This paper introduces a methodology to analyze geometrically the
singularities of manipulators, of which legs apply both actuation forces and
constraint moments to their moving platform. Lower-mobility parallel
manipulators and parallel manipulators, of which some legs do not have any
spherical joint, are such manipulators. The geometric conditions associated
with the dependency of six Pl\""ucker vectors of finite lines or lines at
infinity constituting the rows of the inverse Jacobian matrix are formulated
using Grassmann-Cayley Algebra. Accordingly, the singularity conditions are
obtained in vector form. This study is illustrated with the singularity
analysis of four manipulators."
"It was shown recently that parallel manipulators with several inverse
kinematic solutions have the ability to avoid parallel singularities [Chablat
1998a] and self-collisions [Chablat 1998b] by choosing appropriate joint
configurations for the legs. In effect, depending on the joint configurations
of the legs, a given configuration of the end-effector may or may not be free
of singularity and collision. Characterization of the
collision/singularity-free workspace is useful but may be insufficient since
two configurations can be accessible without collisions nor singularities but
it may not exist a feasible trajectory between them. The goal of this paper is
to define the maximal regions of the workspace where it is possible to execute
trajectories. Twodifferent families of regions are defined : 1. those regions
where the end-effector can move between any set of points, and 2. the regions
where any continuous path can be tracked. These regions are characterized from
the notion of aspects and free-aspects recently defined for parallel
manipulators [Chablat 1998b]. The construction of these regions is achieved by
enrichment techniques and using an extension of the octree structures to spaces
of dimension greater than three. Illustrative examples show the interest of
this study to the optimization of trajectories and the design of parallel
manipulators."
"The paper proposes a novel approach for the geometrical model calibration of
quasi-isotropic parallel kinematic mechanisms of the Orthoglide family. It is
based on the observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during motions
between the specific test postures and employs a low-cost measuring system
composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the universal magnetic
stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the deviation of the relevant
leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP along the Cartesian axes.
Using the measured differences, the developed algorithm estimates the joint
offsets and the leg lengths that are treated as the most essential parameters.
Validity of the proposed calibration technique is confirmed by the experimental
results."
"... This paper is to describe exploratory research on the design of a modular
autonomous mobile robot controller. The controller incorporates a fuzzy logic
[8] [9] approach for steering and speed control [37], a FL approach for
ultrasound sensing and an overall expert system for guidance. The advantages of
a modular system are related to portability and transportability, i.e. any
vehicle can become autonomous with minimal modifications. A mobile robot test
bed has been constructed in university of Cincinnati using a golf cart base.
This cart has full speed control with guidance provided by a vision system and
obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. The speed and steering fuzzy logic
controller is supervised through a multi-axis motion controller. The obstacle
avoidance system is based on a microcontroller interfaced with ultrasonic
transducers. This micro-controller independently handles all timing and
distance calculations and sends distance information back to the fuzzy logic
controller via the serial line. This design yields a portable independent
system in which high speed computer communication is not necessary. Vision
guidance has been accomplished with the use of CCD cameras judging the current
position of the robot.[34] [35][36] It will be generating a good image for
reducing an uncertain wrong command from ground coordinate to tackle the
parameter uncertainties of the system, and to obtain good WMR dynamic
response.[1] Here we Apply 3D line following mythology. It transforms from 3D
to 2D and also maps the image coordinates and vice versa, leading to the
improved accuracy of the WMR position. ..."
"The paper presents a methodology for the enhanced stiffness analysis of
parallel manipulators with internal preloading in passive joints. It also takes
into account influence of the external loading and allows computing both the
non-linear ""load-deflection"" relation and the stiffness matrices for any given
location of the end-platform or actuating drives. Using this methodology, it is
proposed the kinetostatic control algorithm that allows to improve accuracy of
the classical kinematic control and to compensate position errors caused by
elastic deformations in links/joints due to the external/internal loading. The
results are illustrated by an example that deals with a parallel manipulator of
the Orthoglide family where the internal preloading allows to eliminate the
undesired buckling phenomena and to improve the stiffness in the neighborhood
of its kinematic singularities."
"This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of the parallel manipulators
for milling of composite materials. For this application the most significant
performance measurements, which denote the ability of the manipulator for the
machining are defined. In this case, optimal synthesis task is solved as a
multicriterion optimization problem with respect to the geometric, kinematic,
kinetostatic, elastostostatic, dynamic properties. It is shown that stiffness
is an important performance factor. Previous models operate with links
approximation and calculate stiffness matrix in the neighborhood of initial
point. This is a reason why a new way for stiffness matrix calculation is
proposed. This method is illustrated in a concrete industrial problem."
"Virtual human simulation integrated into virtual reality applications is
mainly used for virtual representation of the user in virtual environment or
for interactions between the user and the virtual avatar for cognitive tasks.
In this paper, in order to prevent musculoskeletal disorders, the integration
of virtual human simulation and VR application is presented to facilitate
physical ergonomic evaluation, especially for physical fatigue evaluation of a
given population. Immersive working environments are created to avoid expensive
physical mock-up in conventional evaluation methods. Peripheral motion capture
systems are used to capture natural movements and then to simulate the physical
operations in virtual human simulation. Physical aspects of human's movement
are then analyzed to determine the effort level of each key joint using inverse
kinematics. The physical fatigue level of each joint is further analyzed by
integrating a fatigue and recovery model on the basis of physical task
parameters. All the process has been realized based on VRHIT platform and a
case study is presented to demonstrate the function of the physical fatigue for
a given population and its usefulness for worker selection."
"The paper presents a methodology to enhance the stiffness analysis of
parallel manipulators with parallelogram-based linkage. It directly takes into
account the influence of the external loading and allows computing both the
non-linear ``load-deflection"" relation and relevant rank-deficient stiffness
matrix. An equivalent bar-type pseudo-rigid model is also proposed to describe
the parallelogram stiffness by means of five mutually coupled virtual springs.
The contributions of this paper are highlighted with a parallelogram-type
linkage used in a manipulator from the Orthoglide family."
"This paper investigates the existence conditions of cusp points in the design
parameter space of the R\underline{P}R-2P\underline{R}R parallel manipulators.
Cusp points make possible non-singular assembly-mode changing motion, which can
possibly increase the size of the aspect, i.e. the maximum singularity free
workspace. The method used is based on the notion of discriminant varieties and
Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition, and resorts to Gr\""obner bases for the
solutions of systems of equations."
"The aim of this paper is to compute of the generalized aspects, i.e. the
maximal singularity-free domains in the Cartesian product of the joint space
and workspace, for a planar parallel mechanism in using quadtree model and
interval analysis based method. The parallel mechanisms can admit several
solutions to the inverses and the direct kinematic models. These singular
configurations divide the joint space and the workspace in several not
connected domains. To compute this domains, the quadtree model can be made by
using a discretization of the space. Unfortunately, with this method, some
singular configurations cannot be detected as a single point in the joint
space. The interval analysis based method allow us to assure that no
singularities are not found and to reduce the computing times. This approach is
tested on a simple planar parallel mechanism with two degrees of freedom."
"This paper investigates the cuspidal configurations of 3-RPR parallel
manipulators that may appear on their singular surfaces in the joint space.
Cusp points play an important role in the kinematic behavior of parallel
manipulators since they make possible a non-singular change of assembly mode.
In previous works, the cusp points were calculated in sections of the joint
space by solving a 24th-degree polynomial without any proof that this
polynomial was the only one that gives all solutions. The purpose of this study
is to propose a rigorous methodology to determine the cusp points of
3-R\underline{P}R manipulators and to certify that all cusp points are found.
This methodology uses the notion of discriminant varieties and resorts to
Gr\""obner bases for the solutions of systems of equations."
"This paper deals with the comparison of planar parallel manipulator
architectures based on a multi-objective design optimization approach. The
manipulator architectures are compared with regard to their mass in motion and
their regular workspace size, i.e., the objective functions. The optimization
problem is subject to constraints on the manipulator dexterity and stiffness.
For a given external wrench, the displacements of the moving platform have to
be smaller than given values throughout the obtained maximum regular dexterous
workspace. The contributions of the paper are highlighted with the study of
3-RPR, 3-RPR and 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator architectures, which are
compared by means of their Pareto frontiers obtained with a genetic algorithm."
"For industrial product design, it is very important to take into account
assembly/disassembly and maintenance operations during the conceptual and
prototype design stage. For these operations or other similar operations in a
constrained environment, trajectory planning is always a critical and difficult
issue for evaluating the design or for the users' convenience. In this paper, a
customer-oriented approach is proposed to partially solve ergonomic issues
encountered during the design stage of a constrained environment. A single
objective optimization based method is taken from the literature to generate
the trajectory in a constrained environment automatically. A motion capture
based method assists to guide the trajectory planning interactively if a local
minimum is encountered within the single objective optimization. At last, a
multi-objective evaluation method is proposed to evaluate the operations
generated by the algorithm"
"Current progresses in home automation and service robotic environment have
highlighted the need to develop interoperability mechanisms that allow a
standard communication between the two systems. During the development of the
DHCompliant protocol, the problem of locating mobile devices in an indoor
environment has been investigated. The communication of the device with the
location service has been carried out to study the time delay that web services
offer in front of the sockets. The importance of obtaining data from real-time
location systems portends that a basic tool for interoperability, such as web
services, can be ineffective in this scenario because of the delays added in
the invocation of services. This paper is focused on introducing a web service
to resolve a coordinates request without any significant delay in comparison
with the sockets."
"In this research report details of design of a miniature wheel arrangement
are presented. This miniature wheel arrangement is essentially a direction
control mechanism intended for use on a mobile robot platform or base. The
design is a specific one employing a stepper motor as actuator and as described
can only be used on a certain type of wheeled robots. However, as a basic
steering control element, more than one of these miniature wheel arrangements
can be grouped together to implement more elaborate and intelligent direction
control schemes on varying configurations of wheeled mobile robot platforms."
"During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as
Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have
been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as
probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the
formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms,
e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to
fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of
the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of
samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing
existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the
cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms
converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the
paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are
provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned
solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the
computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of
that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal)
counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between
stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random
geometric graphs."
"The ability to place objects in the environment is an important skill for a
personal robot. An object should not only be placed stably, but should also be
placed in its preferred location/orientation. For instance, a plate is
preferred to be inserted vertically into the slot of a dish-rack as compared to
be placed horizontally in it. Unstructured environments such as homes have a
large variety of object types as well as of placing areas. Therefore our
algorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing
areas. These reasons make placing a challenging manipulation task. In this
work, we propose a supervised learning algorithm for finding good placements
given the point-clouds of the object and the placing area. It learns to combine
the features that capture support, stability and preferred placements using a
shared sparsity structure in the parameters. Even when neither the object nor
the placing area is seen previously in the training set, our algorithm predicts
good placements. In extensive experiments, our method enables the robot to
stably place several new objects in several new placing areas with 98%
success-rate; and it placed the objects in their preferred placements in 92% of
the cases."
"In this paper we present a method for automatically planning optimal paths
for a group of robots that satisfy a common high level mission specification.
Each robot's motion in the environment is modeled as a weighted transition
system. The mission is given as a Linear Temporal Logic formula. In addition,
an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be satisfied. The goal is to minimize
the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition.
Our method is guaranteed to compute an optimal set of robot paths. We utilize a
timed automaton representation in order to capture the relative position of the
robots in the environment. We then obtain a bisimulation of this timed
automaton as a finite transition system that captures the joint behavior of the
robots and apply our earlier algorithm for the single robot case to optimize
the group motion. We present a simulation of a persistent monitoring task in a
road network environment."
"The paper focuses on stiffness matrix computation for manipulators with
passive joints. It proposes both explicit analytical expressions and an
efficient recursive procedure that are applicable in general case and allow
obtaining the desired matrix either in analytical or numerical form. Advantages
of the developed technique and its ability to produce both singular and
non-singular stiffness matrices are illustrated by application examples that
deal with stiffness modeling of two Stewart-Gough platforms."
"We study in this paper a class of 3-RPR manipulators for which the direct
kinematic problem (DKP) is split into a cubic problem followed by a quadratic
one. These manipulators are geometrically characterized by the fact that the
moving triangle is the image of the base triangle by an indirect isometry. We
introduce a specific coordinate system adapted to this geometric feature and
which is also well adapted to the splitting of the DKP. This allows us to
obtain easily precise descriptions of the singularities and of the cusp edges.
These latter second order singularities are important for nonsingular assembly
mode changing. We show how to sort assembly modes and use this sorting for
motion planning in the joint space."
"Performing rescuing and surveillance operations with autonomous ground and
aerial vehicles become more and more apparent task. Involving unmanned robot
systems allows making these operations more efficient, safe and reliable
especially in hazardous areas. This work is devoted to the development of a
cost-efficient micro aerial vehicle in a quadrocopter shape for developmental
purposes within indoor scenarios. It has been constructed with off-the-shelf
components available for mini helicopters. Additional sensors and electronics
are incorporated into this aerial vehicle to stabilize its flight behavior and
to provide a capability of an autonomous navigation in a partially unstructured
indoor environment."
"Cooperation and competition among stand-alone swarm agents increase
collective fitness of the whole system. A principally new kind of collective
systems is demonstrated by some bacteria and fungi, when they build symbiotic
organisms. Symbiotic life forms emerge new functional and self-developmental
capabilities, which allow better survival of swarm agents in different
environments. In this paper we consider energy foraging scenario for two
robotic species, swarm robots and symbiotic robot organism. It is indicated
that aggregation of microrobots into a robot organism can provide better
functional fitness for the whole group. A prototype of microrobots capable of
autonomous aggregation and disaggregation are shown."
"This paper present new approach in robust indirect rotor field oriented
(IRFOC) induction motor (IM) control. The introduction of new exponential
reaching law (ERL) based sliding mode control (SMC) improve significantly the
performances compared to the conventional SMC which are well known susceptible
to the annoying chattering phenomenon, so, the elimination of the chattering is
achieved while simplicity and high performance speed and position tracking are
maintained. Simulation results are given to discuss the performances of the
proposed control method."
"Creation of devices and mechanisms which help people has a long history.
Their inventors always targeted practical goals such as irrigation, harvesting,
devices for construction sites, measurement, and, last but not least, military
tasks for different mechanical and later mechatronic systems. Development of
such assisting mechanisms counts back to Greek engineering, came through Middle
Ages and led finally in XIX and XX centuries to autonomous devices, which we
call today ""Robots"". This chapter provides overview of several robotic
technologies, introduces bio-/chemo- hybrid and collective systems and discuss
their applications in service areas."
"Awareness and self-awareness are two different notions related to knowing the
environment and itself. In a general context, the mechanism of self-awareness
belongs to a class of co-called ""self-issues"" (self-* or self-star):
self-adaptation, self-repairing, self-replication, self-development or
self-recovery. The self-* issues are connected in many ways to adaptability and
evolvability, to the emergence of behavior and to the controllability of
long-term developmental processes. Self-* are either natural properties of
several systems, such as self-assembling of molecular networks, or may emerge
as a result of homeostatic regulation. Different computational processes,
leading to a global optimization, increasing scalability and reliability of
collective systems, create such a homeostatic regulation. Moreover, conditions
of ecological survival, imposed on such systems, lead to a discrimination
between ""self"" and ""non-self"" as well as to the emergence of different
self-phenomena. There are many profound challenges, such as understanding these
mechanisms, or long-term predictability, which have a considerable impact on
research in the area of artificial intelligence and intelligent systems."
"In this paper we present a method for automatically planning robust optimal
paths for a group of robots that satisfy a common high level mission
specification. Each robot's motion in the environment is modeled as a weighted
transition system, and the mission is given as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
formula over a set of propositions satisfied by the regions of the environment.
In addition, an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be satisfied. The goal
is to minimize the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing
proposition while ensuring that the LTL formula is satisfied even with
uncertainty in the robots' traveling times. We characterize a class of LTL
formulas that are robust to robot timing errors, for which we generate optimal
paths if no timing errors are present, and we present bounds on the deviation
from the optimal values in the presence of errors. We implement and
experimentally evaluate our method considering a persistent monitoring task in
a road network environment."
"Placing is a necessary skill for a personal robot to have in order to perform
tasks such as arranging objects in a disorganized room. The object placements
should not only be stable but also be in their semantically preferred placing
areas and orientations. This is challenging because an environment can have a
large variety of objects and placing areas that may not have been seen by the
robot before.
  In this paper, we propose a learning approach for placing multiple objects in
different placing areas in a scene. Given point-clouds of the objects and the
scene, we design appropriate features and use a graphical model to encode
various properties, such as the stacking of objects, stability, object-area
relationship and common placing constraints. The inference in our model is an
integer linear program, which we solve efficiently via an LP relaxation. We
extensively evaluate our approach on 98 objects from 16 categories being placed
into 40 areas. Our robotic experiments show a success rate of 98% in placing
known objects and 82% in placing new objects stably. We use our method on our
robots for performing tasks such as loading several dish-racks, a bookshelf and
a fridge with multiple items."
"This paper develops an algorithm that guides a multi-robot system in an
unknown environment in search of fixed targets. The area to be scanned contains
an unknown number of convex obstacles of unknown size and shape. The algorithm
covers the entire free space in a sweeping fashion and as such relies on the
use of robot formations. The geometry of the robot group is a lateral line
formation, which is allowed to split and rejoin when passing obstacles. It is
our main goal to exploit this formation structure in order to reduce robot
resources to a minimum. Each robot has a limited and finite amount of memory
available. No information of the topography is recorded. Communication between
two robots is only possible up to a maximum inter-robot distance, and if the
line-of-sight between both robots is not obstructed. Broadcasting capabilities
and indirect communication are not allowed. Supervisory control is prohibited.
The number of robots equipped with GPS is kept as small as possible.
Applications of the algorithm are mine field clearance, search-and-rescue
missions, and intercept missions. Simulations are included and made available
on the internet, demonstrating the flexibility of the algorithm."
"The paper focuses on stiffness matrix computation for manipulators with
passive joints, compliant actuators and flexible links. It proposes both
explicit analytical expressions and an efficient recursive procedure that are

"Artificial immune systems primarily mimic the adaptive nature of biological
immune functions. Their ability to adapt to varying pathogens makes such
systems a suitable choice for various robotic applications. Generally,
AIS-based robotic applications map local instantaneous sensory information into
either an antigen or a co-stimulatory signal, according to the choice of
representation schema. Algorithms then use relevant immune functions to output
either evolved antibodies or maturity of dendritic cells, in terms of actuation
signals. It is observed that researchers, in an attempt to solve the problem in
hand, do not try to replicate the biological immunity but select necessary
immune functions instead, resulting in an ad-hoc manner these applications are
reported. Authors, therefore, present a comprehensive review of immuno-inspired
robotic applications in an attempt to categorize them according to underlying
immune definitions. Implementation details are tabulated in terms of
corresponding mathematical expressions and their representation schema that
include binary, real or hybrid data. Limitations of reported applications are
also identified in light of modern immunological interpretations. As a result
of this study, authors suggest a renewed focus on innate immunity and also
emphasize that immunological representations should benefit from robot
embodiment and must be extended to include modern trends."
"In modern life the road safety has becomes the core issue. One single move of
a driver can cause horrifying accident. The main goal of intelligent car system
is to make communication with other cars on the road. The system is able to
control to speed, direction and the distance between the cars the intelligent
car system is able to recognize traffic light and is able to take decision
according to it. This paper presents a framework of the intelligent car system.
I validate several aspect of our system using simulation."
"We present a simple and natural extension of the multi-robot motion planning
problem where the robots are partitioned into groups (colors), such that in
each group the robots are interchangeable. Every robot is no longer required to
move to a specific target, but rather to some target placement that is assigned
to its group. We call this problem k-color multi-robot motion planning and
provide a sampling-based algorithm specifically designed for solving it. At the
heart of the algorithm is a novel technique where the k-color problem is
reduced to several discrete multi-robot motion planning problems. These
reductions amplify basic samples into massive collections of free placements
and paths for the robots. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by an
implementation for the case of disc robots and polygonal robots translating in
the plane. We show that the algorithm successfully and efficiently copes with a
variety of challenging scenarios, involving many robots, while a simplified
version of this algorithm, that can be viewed as an extension of a prevalent
sampling-based algorithm for the k-color case, fails even on simple scenarios.
Interestingly, our algorithm outperforms a well established implementation of
PRM for the standard multi-robot problem, in which each robot has a distinct
color."
"The in-flight alignment is a critical stage for airborne INS/GPS
applications. The alignment task is usually carried out by the Kalman filtering
technique that necessitates a good initial attitude to obtain satisfying
performance. Due to the airborne dynamics, the in-flight alignment is much
difficult than alignment on the ground. This paper proposes an
optimization-based coarse alignment approach using GPS position/velocity as
input, founded on the newly-derived velocity/position integration formulae.
Simulation and flight test results show that, with the GPS lever arm well
handled, it is potentially able to yield the initial heading up to one degree
accuracy in ten seconds. It can serve as a nice coarse in-flight alignment
without any prior attitude information for the subsequent fine Kalman
alignment. The approach can also be applied to other applications that require
aligning the INS on the run."
"Inertial navigation applications are usually referenced to a rotating frame.
Consideration of the navigation reference frame rotation in the inertial
navigation algorithm design is an important but so far less seriously treated
issue, especially for ultra-high-speed flying aircraft or the future
ultra-precision navigation system of several meters per hour. This paper
proposes a rigorous approach to tackle the issue of navigation frame rotation
in velocity/position computation by use of the newly-devised velocity/position
integration formulae in the Part I companion paper. The two integration
formulae set a well-founded cornerstone for the velocity/position algorithms
design that makes the comprehension of the inertial navigation computation
principle more accessible to practitioners, and different approximations to the
integrals involved will give birth to various velocity/position update
algorithms. Two-sample velocity and position algorithms are derived to
exemplify the design process. In the context of level-flight airplane examples,
the derived algorithm is analytically and numerically compared to the typical
algorithms existing in the literature. The results throw light on the problems
in existing algorithms and the potential benefits of the derived algorithm."
"In this paper, we consider the automated planning of optimal paths for a
robotic team satisfying a high level mission specification. Each robot in the
team is modeled as a weighted transition system where the weights have
associated deviation values that capture the non-determinism in the traveling
times of the robot during its deployment. The mission is given as a Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set of propositions satisfied at the
regions of the environment. Additionally, we have an optimizing proposition
capturing some particular task that must be repeatedly completed by the team.
The goal is to minimize the maximum time between successive satisfying
instances of the optimizing proposition while guaranteeing that the mission is
satisfied even under non-deterministic traveling times. Our method relies on
the communication capabilities of the robots to guarantee correctness and
maintain performance during deployment. After computing a set of optimal
satisfying paths for the members of the team, we also compute a set of
synchronization sequences for each robot to ensure that the LTL formula is
never violated during deployment. We implement and experimentally evaluate our
method considering a persistent monitoring task in a road network environment."
"Observability is a key aspect of the state estimation problem of SLAM,
However, the dimension and variables of SLAM system might be changed with new
features, to which little attention is paid in the previous work. In this
paper, a unified approach of observability analysis for SLAM system is
provided, whether the dimension and variables of SLAM system are changed or
not, we can use this approach to analyze the local or total observability of
the SLAM system."
"Many tasks in robotics can be decomposed into sub-tasks that are performed
simultaneously. In many cases, these sub-tasks cannot all be achieved jointly
and a prioritization of such sub-tasks is required to resolve this issue. In
this paper, we discuss a novel learning approach that allows to learn a
prioritized control law built on a set of sub-tasks represented by motor
primitives. The primitives are executed simultaneously but have different
priorities. Primitives of higher priority can override the commands of the
conflicting lower priority ones. The dominance structure of these primitives
has a significant impact on the performance of the prioritized control law. We
evaluate the proposed approach with a ball bouncing task on a Barrett WAM."
"We address the problem of controlling a noisy differential drive mobile robot
such that the probability of satisfying a specification given as a Bounded
Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL) formula over a set of properties at the regions in
the environment is maximized. We assume that the vehicle can determine its
precise initial position in a known map of the environment. However, inspired
by practical limitations, we assume that the vehicle is equipped with noisy
actuators and, during its motion in the environment, it can only measure the
angular velocity of its wheels using limited accuracy incremental encoders.
Assuming the duration of the motion is finite, we map the measurements to a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). We use recent results in Statistical Model
Checking (SMC) to obtain an MDP control policy that maximizes the probability
of satisfaction. We translate this policy to a vehicle feedback control
strategy and show that the probability that the vehicle satisfies the
specification in the environment is bounded from below by the probability of
satisfying the specification on the MDP. We illustrate our method with
simulations and experimental results."
"Recursive matrix relations for the complete dynamics of a 3-PRP planar
parallel robot are established in this paper. Three identical planar legs
connecting to the moving platform are located in the same vertical plane.
Knowing the motion of the platform, we develop first the inverse kinematical
problem and determine the positions, velocities and accelerations of the robot.
Further, the inverse dynamic problem is solved using an approach based on the
principle of virtual work. Finally, some graphs of simulation for the input
powers of three actuators and the internal joint forces are obtained."
"The paper presents a novel technique for the design of optimal calibration
experiments for a planar anthropomorphic manipulator with n degrees of freedom.
Proposed approach for selection of manipulator configurations allows
essentially improving calibration accuracy and reducing parameter
identification errors. The results are illustrated by application examples that
deal with typical anthropomorphic manipulators."
"In this chapter we will highlight our experimental studies on natural human
walking analysis and introduce a biologically inspired design for simple
bipedal locomotion system of humanoid robots. Inspiration comes directly from
human walking analysis and human muscles mechanism and control. A hybrid
algorithm for walking gaits generation is then proposed as an innovative
alternative to classically used kinematics and dynamic equations solving, the
gaits include knee, ankle and hip trajectories. The proposed algorithm is an
intelligent evolutionary based on particle swarm optimization paradigm. This
proposal can be used for small size humanoid robots, with a knee an ankle and a
hip and at least six Degrees of Freedom (DOF)."

and Models for Robotic Systems (DSLRob'11), held in conjunction with the 2011
IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS
2011), September 2011 in San Francisco, USA.
  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language (DSL) is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem
domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level way for domain users
to specify the functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction.
DSLs and models have historically been used for programming complex systems.
However recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study.
Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that
intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time
constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages
often lead to a poor fit between the language features and the implementation
requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this
problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel
software solutions to complex problems"
"Nowadays, vehicle safety is constantly increasing thanks to the improvement
of vehicle passive and active safety. However, on a daily usage of the car,
traffic jams remains a problem. With limited space for road infrastructure,
automation of the driving task on specific situation seems to be a possible
solution. The French project ABV, which stands for low speed automation, tries
to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and to prove the benefits. In
this article, we describe the scientific background of the project and expected
outputs."
"The Robotic Remote Laboratory controls the Robot labs via the Internet and
applies the Robot experiment in easy and advanced way. If we want to enhance
the RRL system, we must study requirements of the Robot experiment in a deeply
way. One of key requirements of the Robot experiment is the Control algorithm
that includes all important activities to affect the Robot; one of them relates
the path or obstacle. Our goal is to produce a new design of the RRL includes a
new treatment to the Control algorithm depends on isolation one of the Control
algorithm's activities that relates the paths in a separated algorithm, i.e.,
design the (Path planning algorithm) is independent of the original Control
algorithm. This aim can be achieved by depending on the light to produce the
Light obstacle. To apply the Light obstacle, we need to hardware (Light control
server and Light arms) and soft ware (path planning algorithm).The NXT 2.0
Robot will sense the Light obstacle depending on the Light sensor of it. The
new design has two servers, one for the path (Light control server) and other
for the other activities of the Control algorithm (Robot control server).The
website of the new design includes three main parts (Lab Reservation, Open Lab,
Download Simulation).We proposed a set of scenarios for organizing the
reservation of the Remote Lab. Additionally, we developed an appropriate
software to simulate the Robot and to practice it before usage the Remote lab."
"Concurrently estimating the 6-DOF pose of multiple cameras or
robots---cooperative localization---is a core problem in contemporary robotics.
Current works focus on a set of mutually observable world landmarks and often
require inbuilt egomotion estimates; situations in which both assumptions are
violated often arise, for example, robots with erroneous low quality odometry
and IMU exploring an unknown environment. In contrast to these existing works
in cooperative localization, we propose a cooperative localization method,
which we call mutual localization, that uses reciprocal observations of
camera-fiducials to obviate the need for egomotion estimates and mutually
observable world landmarks. We formulate and solve an algebraic formulation for
the pose of the two camera mutual localization setup under these assumptions.
Our experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal egomotion-free
cooperative localization method: for example, the method achieves 2cm range and
0.7 degree accuracy at 2m sensing for 6-DOF pose. To demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed work, we deploy our method on Turtlebots and we
compare our results with ARToolKit and Bundler, over which our method achieves
a 10 fold improvement in translation estimation accuracy."
"This paper introduces the i-HY Hand, an underactuated hand driven by 5
actuators that is capable of performing a wide range of grasping and in-hand
manipulation tasks. This hand was designed to address the need for a durable,
inexpensive, moderately dexterous hand suitable for use on mobile robots. The
primary focus of this paper will be on the novel minimalistic design of i-HY,
which was developed by choosing a set of target tasks around which the design
of the hand was optimized. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of
underactuated fingers that are capable of both firm power grasps and low-
stiffness fingertip grasps using only the passive mechanics of the finger
mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate successful grasping of a wide range
of target objects, the stability of fingertip grasping, as well as the ability
to adjust the force exerted on grasped objects using the passive finger
mechanics."
"This technical report is an extended version of the paper 'A Receding Horizon
Algorithm for Informative Path Planning with Temporal Logic Constraints'
accepted to the 2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
(ICRA). This paper considers the problem of finding the most informative path
for a sensing robot under temporal logic constraints, a richer set of
constraints than have previously been considered in information gathering. An
algorithm for informative path planning is presented that leverages tools from
information theory and formal control synthesis, and is proven to give a path
that satisfies the given temporal logic constraints. The algorithm uses a
receding horizon approach in order to provide a reactive, on-line solution
while mitigating computational complexity. Statistics compiled from multiple
simulation studies indicate that this algorithm performs better than a baseline
exhaustive search approach."

"There is no dearth of new robots that provide both generalized and customized
platforms for learning and research. Unfortunately as we attempt to adapt
existing software components, we are faced with an explosion of device drivers
that interface each hardware platform with existing frameworks. We certainly
gain the efficiencies of reusing algorithms and tools developed across
platforms but only once the device driver is created.
  We propose a domain specific language that describes the development and
runtime interface of a robot and defines its link to existing frameworks. The
Robot Device Interface Specification (RDIS) takes advantage of the internal
firmware present on many existing devices by defining the communication
mechanism, syntax and semantics in such a way to enable the generation of
automatic interface links and resource discovery. We present the current domain
model as it relates to differential drive robots as a mechanism to use the RDIS
to link described robots to HTML5 via web sockets and ROS (Robot Operating
System)."
"This work-in-progress paper reports on our efforts to improve different
aspects of coordination in complex, component-based robotic systems.
Coordination is a system level aspect concerned with commanding, configuring
and monitoring functional computations such that the system as a whole behaves
as desired. To that end a variety of models such as Petri-nets or Finite State
Machines may be utilized. These models specify actions to be executed, such as
invoking operations or configuring components to achieve a certain goal.
  This traditional approach has several disadvantages related to loss of
reusability of coordination models due to coupling with platform-specific
functionality, non-deterministic temporal behavior and limited robustness as a
result of executing platform operations within the context of the coordinator.
  To avoid these shortcomings, we propose to split this ""rich"" coordinator into
a Pure Coordinator and a Configurator. Although the coordinator remains in
charge of commanding and reacting, the execution of actions is deferred to the
Configurator. This pattern, called ""Coordinator-Configurator"", is implemented
as a novel Configurator domain specific language that can be used together with
any model of coordination. We illustrate the approach by refactoring an

manipulators."
"Designing novel cyber-physical systems entails significant, costly physical
experimentation. Simulation tools can enable the virtualization of experiments.
Unfortunately, current tools have shortcomings that limit their utility for
virtual experimentation. Language research can be especially helpful in
addressing many of these problems. As a first step in this direction, we
consider the question of determining what language features are needed to model
cyber-physical systems. Using a series of elementary examples of cyber-physical
systems, we reflect on the extent to which a small, experimental
domain-specific formalism called Acumen suffices for this purpose."
"In this paper, we develop a provably correct optimal control strategy for a
finite deterministic transition system. By assuming that penalties with known
probabilities of occurrence and dynamics can be sensed locally at the states of
the system, we derive a receding horizon strategy that minimizes the expected
average cumulative penalty incurred between two consecutive satisfactions of a
desired property. At the same time, we guarantee the satisfaction of
correctness specifications expressed as Linear Temporal Logic formulas. We
illustrate the approach with a persistent surveillance robotics application."
"We consider the problem of automatic generation of control strategies for
robotic vehicles given a set of high-level mission specifications, such as
""Vehicle x must eventually visit a target region and then return to a base,""
""Regions A and B must be periodically surveyed,"" or ""None of the vehicles can
enter an unsafe region."" We focus on instances when all of the given
specifications cannot be reached simultaneously due to their incompatibility
and/or environmental constraints. We aim to find the least-violating control
strategy while considering different priorities of satisfying different parts
of the mission. Formally, we consider the missions given in the form of linear
temporal logic formulas, each of which is assigned a reward that is earned when
the formula is satisfied. Leveraging ideas from the automata-based model
checking, we propose an algorithm for finding an optimal control strategy that
maximizes the sum of rewards earned if this control strategy is applied. We
demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an illustrative case study."
"Service robots act in open-ended, natural environments. Therefore, due to
combinatorial explosion of potential situations, it is not possible to foresee
all eventualities in advance during robot design. In addition, due to limited
resources on a mobile robot, it is not feasible to plan any action on demand.
Hence, it is necessary to provide a mechanism to express variability at
design-time that can be efficiently resolved on the robot at run-time based on
the then available information. In this paper, we introduce a DSL to express
run- time variability focused on the execution quality of the robot (in terms
of non-functional properties like safety and task efficiency) under changing
situations and limited resources. We underpin the applicability of our approach
by an example integrated into an overall robotics architecture."
"This paper presents a DSL for geometric relations between rigid bodies such
as relative position, orientation, pose, linear velocity, angular velocity, and
twist. The DSL is the formal model of the recently proposed semantics for the
standardization of geometric relations between rigid bodies, referred to as
`geometric semantics'. This semantics explicitly states the
coordinate-invariant properties and operations, and, more importantly, all the
choices that are made in coordinate representations of these geometric
relations. This results in a set of concrete suggestions for standardizing
terminology and notation, allowing programmers to write fully unambiguous
software interfaces, including automatic checks for semantic correctness of all
geometric operations on rigid-body coordinate representations.
  The DSL is implemented in two different ways: an external DSL in Xcore and an
internal DSL in Prolog. Besides defining a grammar and operations, the DSL also
implements constraints. In the Xcore model, the Object Constraint Language
language is used, while in the Prolog model, the constraint are natively
modelled in Prolog.
  This paper discusses the implemented DSL and the tools developed on top of
this DSL. In particular an editor, checking the semantic constraints and
providing semantic meaningful errors during editing is proposed."
"DORI (Distributed Outdoor Robotic Instruments) is a remotely controlled
vehicle that is designed to simulate a planetary exploration mission. DORI is
equipped with over 20 environmental sensors and can perform basic data
analysis, logging and remote upload. The individual components are distributed
across a fault-tolerant bus for redundancy. A partial sensor list includes
atmospheric pressure, rainfall, wind speed, GPS, gyroscopic inertia, linear
acceleration, magnetic field strength, temperature, laser and ultrasonic
distance sensing, as well as digital audio and video capture. The project uses
recycled consumer electronics devices as a low-cost source for sensor
components. This report describes the hardware design of DORI including sensor
electronics, embedded firmware, and physical construction."
"Humanoid robots without internal sensors such as a compass tend to lose their
orientation after a fall. Furthermore, re-initialisation is often ambiguous due
to symmetric man-made environments. The room-awareness module proposed here is
inspired by the results of psychological experiments and improves existing
self-localization strategies by mapping and matching the visual background with
colour histograms. The matching algorithm uses a particle-filter to generate
hypotheses of the viewing directions independent of the self-localization
algorithm and generates confidence values for various possible poses. The
robot's behaviour controller uses those confidence values to control
self-localization algorithm to converge to the most likely pose and prevents
the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima. Experiments with a symmetric
Standard Platform League RoboCup playing field with a simulated and a real
humanoid NAO robot show the significant improvement of the system."
"We begin this paper by presenting our approach to robot manipulation, which
emphasizes the benefits of making contact with the world across the entire
manipulator. We assume that low contact forces are benign, and focus on the
development of robots that can control their contact forces during
goal-directed motion. Inspired by biology, we assume that the robot has
low-stiffness actuation at its joints, and tactile sensing across the entire
surface of its manipulator. We then describe a novel controller that exploits
these assumptions. The controller only requires haptic sensing and does not
need an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It also handles
multiple contacts across the surface of the manipulator. The controller uses
model predictive control (MPC) with a time horizon of length one, and a linear
quasi-static mechanical model that it constructs at each time step. We show
that this controller enables both real and simulated robots to reach goal
locations in high clutter with low contact forces. Our experiments include
tests using a real robot with a novel tactile sensor array on its forearm
reaching into simulated foliage and a cinder block. In our experiments, robots
made contact across their entire arms while pushing aside movable objects,
deforming compliant objects, and perceiving the world."
"In this paper, we extend the recent body of work on planning under
uncertainty to include the fact that sensors may not provide any measurement
owing to misdetection. This is caused either by adverse environmental
conditions that prevent the sensors from making measurements or by the
fundamental limitations of the sensors. Examples include RF-based ranging
devices that intermittently do not receive the signal from beacons because of
obstacles; the misdetection of features by a camera system in detrimental
lighting conditions; a LIDAR sensor that is pointed at a glass-based material
such as a window, etc.
  The main contribution of this paper is twofold. We first show that it is
possible to obtain an analytical bound on the performance of a state estimator
under sensor misdetection occurring stochastically over time in the
environment. We then show how this bound can be used in a sample-based path
planning algorithm to produce a path that trades off accuracy and robustness.
Computational results demonstrate the benefit of the approach and comparisons
are made with the state of the art in path planning under state uncertainty."
"This paper studies the problem of control strategy synthesis for dynamical
systems with differential constraints to fulfill a given reachability goal
while satisfying a set of safety rules. Particular attention is devoted to
goals that become feasible only if a subset of the safety rules are violated.
The proposed algorithm computes a control law, that minimizes the level of
unsafety while the desired goal is guaranteed to be reached. This problem is
motivated by an autonomous car navigating an urban environment while following
rules of the road such as ""always travel in right lane'' and ""do not change
lanes frequently''. Ideas behind sampling based motion-planning algorithms,
such as Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees
(RRTs), are employed to incrementally construct a finite concretization of the
dynamics as a durational Kripke structure. In conjunction with this, a weighted
finite automaton that captures the safety rules is used in order to find an
optimal trajectory that minimizes the violation of safety rules. We prove that
the proposed algorithm guarantees asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost-sure
convergence to optimal solutions. We present results of simulation experiments
and an implementation on an autonomous urban mobility-on-demand system."
"Recently several hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers based on cascades
of quadratic programs have been proposed for application on torque controlled
robots. They have important theoretical benefits but have never been
implemented on a torque controlled robot where model inaccuracies and real-time
computation requirements can be problematic. In this contribution we present an
experimental evaluation of these algorithms in the context of balance control
for a humanoid robot. The presented experiments demonstrate the applicability
of the approach under real robot conditions (i.e. model uncertainty, estimation
errors, etc). We propose a simplification of the optimization problem that
allows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque
control loop. We implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows
robust performance in face of unknown disturbances, even when the robot is
standing on only one foot. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated
to demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated
hierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers
can be used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based
balance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot."
"We present a sampling-based framework for multi-robot motion planning which
combines an implicit representation of a roadmap with a novel approach for
pathfinding in geometrically embedded graphs tailored for our setting. Our
pathfinding algorithm, discrete-RRT (dRRT), is an adaptation of the celebrated
RRT algorithm for the discrete case of a graph, and it enables a rapid
exploration of the high-dimensional configuration space by carefully walking
through an implicit representation of a tensor product of roadmaps for the
individual robots. We demonstrate our approach experimentally on scenarios of
up to 60 degrees of freedom where our algorithm is faster by a factor of at
least ten when compared to existing algorithms that we are aware of."
"We study the problem of coordinating multiple robots along fixed geometric
paths. Our contribution is threefold. First we formalize the intuitive concept
of priorities as a binary relation induced by a feasible coordination solution,
without excluding the case of robots following each other on the same geometric
path. Then we prove that two paths in the coordination space are continuously
deformable into each other if and only if they induce the \emph{same priority
graph}, that is, the priority graph uniquely encodes homotopy classes of
coordination solutions. Finally, we give a simple control law allowing to
safely navigate into homotopy classes \emph{under kinodynamic constraints} even
in the presence of unexpected events, such as a sudden robot deceleration
without notice. It appears the freedom within homotopy classes allows to much
deviate from any pre-planned trajectory without ever colliding nor having to
re-plan the assigned priorities."
"Obstacle avoidance is an important task in the field of robotics, since the
goal of autonomous robot is to reach the destination without collision. Several
algorithms have been proposed for obstacle avoidance, having drawbacks and
benefits. In this survey paper, we mainly discussed different algorithms for
robot navigation with obstacle avoidance. We also compared all provided
algorithms and mentioned their characteristics; advantages and disadvantages,
so that we can select final efficient algorithm by fusing discussed algorithms.
Comparison table is provided for justifying the area of interest"
"In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning
algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is
specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in
high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be
asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster
than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT*
algorithm performs a ""lazy"" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined
number of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves
steadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis
approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT*
algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra
mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate
bounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning.
Specifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration
spaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order $O(n^{-1/d+\rho})$, where
$n$ is the number of sampled points, $d$ is the dimension of the configuration
space, and $\rho$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate
asymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the
configuration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length,
and when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead
of a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions
and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by
showing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better
solutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional
configuration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive."

"Path planning of Robot is one of the challenging fields in the area of
Robotics research. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm to find path
between starting and ending position for an intelligent system. An intelligent
system is considered to be a device/robot having an antenna connected with
sensor-detector system. The proposed algorithm is based on Neural Network
training concept. The considered neural network is Adapti ve to the knowledge
bases. However, implementation of this algorithm is slightly expensive due to
hardware it requires. From detailed analysis, it can be proved that the
resulted path of this algorithm is efficient."
"We present Lower Bound Tree-RRT (LBT-RRT), a single-query sampling-based
algorithm that is asymptotically near-optimal. Namely, the solution extracted
from LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of
1+epsilon of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous
interpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal
RRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no
approximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like RRG. When the approximation
factor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like RRT. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to
produce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster
than RRT* would run. This is done by maintaining a tree which is a sub-graph of
the RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary graph, which we call the lower-bound
graph. The combination of the two roadmaps, which is faster to maintain than
the roadmap maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantees asymptotic
near-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality, anytime motion
planning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging
from 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation
factors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable to RRG and
RRT*) with little running-time overhead when compared to RRT."
"The issue of single range based observability analysis and observer design
for the kinematics model of a 3D vehicle subject to a constant unknown drift
velocity is addressed. The proposed method departs from alternative solutions
to the problem and leads to the definition of a linear time invariant state
equation with a linear time varying output that can be used to globally solve
the original nonlinear state estimation problem with a standard Kalman filter.
Simple necessary and sufficient observability conditions are derived. Numerical
simulation examples are described to illustrate the performance of the method."
"Numerous algorithms have been proposed to allow legged robots to learn to
walk. However, the vast majority of these algorithms is devised to learn to
walk in a straight line, which is not sufficient to accomplish any real-world
mission. Here we introduce the Transferability-based Behavioral Repertoire
Evolution algorithm (TBR-Evolution), a novel evolutionary algorithm that
simultaneously discovers several hundreds of simple walking controllers, one
for each possible direction. By taking advantage of solutions that are usually
discarded by evolutionary processes, TBR-Evolution is substantially faster than
independently evolving each controller. Our technique relies on two methods:
(1) novelty search with local competition, which searches for both
high-performing and diverse solutions, and (2) the transferability approach,
which com-bines simulations and real tests to evolve controllers for a physical
robot. We evaluate this new technique on a hexapod robot. Results show that
with only a few dozen short experiments performed on the robot, the algorithm
learns a repertoire of con-trollers that allows the robot to reach every point
in its reachable space. Overall, TBR-Evolution opens a new kind of learning
algorithm that simultaneously optimizes all the achievable behaviors of a
robot."
"We study the problem of multi-robot target assignment to minimize the total
distance traveled by the robots until they all reach an equal number of static
targets. In the first half of the paper, we present a necessary and sufficient
condition under which true distance optimality can be achieved for robots with
limited communication and target-sensing ranges. Moreover, we provide an
explicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed to
achieve distance optimality in terms of the robots' communication and
target-sensing ranges with arbitrary guaranteed probabilities. The same bounds
are also shown to be asymptotically tight.
  In the second half of the paper, we present suboptimal strategies for use
when the number of robots cannot be chosen freely. Assuming first that all
targets are known to all robots, we employ a hierarchical communication model
in which robots communicate only with other robots in the same partitioned
region. This hierarchical communication model leads to constant approximations
of true distance-optimal solutions under mild assumptions. We then revisit the
limited communication and sensing models. By combining simple rendezvous-based
strategies with a hierarchical communication model, we obtain decentralized
hierarchical strategies that achieve constant approximation ratios with respect
to true distance optimality. Results of simulation show that the approximation
ratio is as low as 1.4."
"In this paper we study the time delays affecting the diffusion of information
in an underwater heterogeneous robot swarm, considering a time-sensitive
environment. In many situations each member of the swarm must update its
knowledge about the environment as soon as possible, thus every effort to
expand the knowledge horizon is useful. Otherwise critical information may not
reach nodes far from the source causing dangerous misbehaviour of the swarm. We
consider two extreme situations. In the first scenario we have an unique
probabilistic delay distribution. In the second scenario, each agent is subject
to a different truncated gaussian distribution, meaning local conditions are
significantly different from link to link. We study how several swarm
topologies react to the two scenarios and how to allocate the more efficient
transmission resources in order to expand the horizon. Results show that
significant time savings under a gossip-like protocol are possible properly
allocating the resources. Moreover, methods to determine the fastest swarm
topologies and the most important nodes are suggested."
"Many day-to-day activities require the dexterous manipulation of a redundant
humanoid arm in complex 3D environments. However, position regulation of such
robot arm systems becomes very difficult in presence of non-linear
uncertainties in the system. Also, perturbations exist due to various unwanted
interactions with obstacles for clumsy environments in which obstacle avoidance
is not possible, and this makes position regulation even more difficult. This
report proposes a non-linear task-space disturbance observer by virtue of which
position regulation of such robotic systems can be achieved in spite of such
perturbations and uncertainties. Simulations are conducted using a 7-DOF
redundant robot arm system to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
These results are then compared with the case of a conventional mass-damper
based task-space disturbance observer to show the enhancement in performance
using the developed concept. This proposed method is then applied to a
controller which exhibits human-like motion characteristics for reaching a
target. Arbitrary perturbations in the form of interactions with obstacles are
introduced in its path. Results show that the robot end-effector successfully
continues to move in its path of a human-like quasi-straight trajectory even if
the joint trajectories deviated by a considerable amount due to the
perturbations. These results are also compared with that of the unperturbed
motion of the robot which further prove the significance of the developed
scheme."
"This technical report gives an overview of our work on control algorithms
dealing with redundant robot systems for achieving human-like motion
characteristics. Previously, we developed a novel control law to exhibit
human-motion characteristics in redundant robot arm systems as well as
arm-trunk systems for reaching tasks [1], [2]. This newly developed method
nullifies the need for the computation of pseudo-inverse of Jacobian while the
formulation and optimization of any artificial performance index is not
necessary. The time-varying properties of the muscle stiffness and damping as
well as the low-pass filter characteristics of human muscles have been modeled
by the proposed control law to generate human-motion characteristics for
reaching motion like quasi-straight line trajectory of the end-effector and
symmetric bell shaped velocity profile. This report focuses on the experiments
performed using a 7-DOF redundant robot-arm system which proved the
effectiveness of this algorithm in imitating human-like motion characteristics.
In addition, we extended this algorithm to a 19-DOF Hand-Arm System for a
reach-to-grasp task. Simulations using the 19-DOF Hand-Arm System show the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme for effective human-like hand-arm
coordination in reach-to-grasp tasks for pinch and envelope grasps on objects
of different shapes such as a box, a cylinder, and a sphere."
"We describe a whole-body dynamic walking controller implemented as a convex
quadratic program. The controller solves an optimal control problem using an
approximate value function derived from a simple walking model while respecting
the dynamic, input, and contact constraints of the full robot dynamics. By
exploiting sparsity and temporal structure in the optimization with a custom
active-set algorithm, we surpass the performance of the best available
off-the-shelf solvers and achieve 1kHz control rates for a 34-DOF humanoid. We
describe applications to balancing and walking tasks using the simulated Atlas
robot in the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge."
"Perception-for-grasping is a challenging problem in robotics. Inexpensive
range sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect provide sensing capabilities that
have given new life to the effort of developing robust and accurate perception
methods for robot grasping. This paper proposes a new approach to localizing
enveloping grasp affordances in 3-D point clouds efficiently. The approach is
based on modeling enveloping grasp affordances as a cylindrical shells that
corresponds to the geometry of the robot hand. A fast and accurate fitting
method for quadratic surfaces is the core of our approach. An evaluation on a
set of cluttered environments shows high precision and recall statistics. Our
results also show that the approach compares favorably with some alternatives,
and that it is efficient enough to be employed for robot grasping in real-time."
"This paper introduces a new approach to 3-D position estimation from
acceleration data, i.e., a 3-D motion tracking system having a small size and
low-cost magnetic and inertial measurement unit (MIMU) composed by both a
digital compass and a gyroscope as interaction technology. A major challenge is
to minimize the error caused by the process of double integration of
accelerations due to motion (these ones have to be separated from the
accelerations due to gravity). Owing to drift error, position estimation cannot
be performed with adequate accuracy for periods longer than few seconds. For
this reason, we propose a method to detect motion stops and only integrate
accelerations in moments of effective hand motion during the demonstration
process. The proposed system is validated and evaluated with experiments
reporting a common daily life pick-and-place task."
"Increasingly, industrial robots are being used in production systems. This is
because they are highly flexible machines and economically competitive with
human labor. The problem is that they are difficult to program. Thus,
manufacturing system designers are looking for more intuitive ways to program
robots, especially using the CAD drawings of the production system they
developed. This paper presents an industrial application of a novel CAD-based
off-line robot programming (OLP) and simulation system in which the CAD package
used for cell design is also used for OLP and robot simulation. Thus, OLP
becomes more accessible to anyone with basic knowledge of CAD and robotics. The
system was tested in a robot-assisted sheet metal bending cell. Experiments
allowed identifying the pros and cons of the proposed solution."
"The paper deals with the design of experiments for manipulator geometric and
elastostatic calibration based on the test-pose approach. The main attention is
paid to the efficiency improvement of numerical techniques employed in the
selection of optimal measurement poses for calibration experiments. The
advantages of the developed technique are illustrated by simulation examples
that deal with the geometric calibration of the industrial robot of serial
architecture."
"The paper deals with the modeling and identification of the gravity
compensators used in heavy industrial robots. The main attention is paid to the
geometrical parameters identification and calibration accuracy. To reduce
impact of the measurement errors, the design of calibration experiments is
used. The advantages of the developed technique are illustrated by experimental
results"
"The paper focuses on the robust identification of geometrical and
elastostatic parameters of robotic manipulator. The main attention is paid to
the efficiency improvement of the identification algorithm. To increase the
identification accuracy, it is proposed to apply the weighted least square
technique that employs a new algorithm for assigning of the weighting
coefficients. The latter allows taking into account variation of the
measurement system precision in different directions and throughout the robot
workspace. The advantages of the proposed approach are illustrated by an
application example that deals with the elasto-static calibration of industrial
robot."
"The paper focuses on the calibration of serial industrial robots using
partial pose measurements. In contrast to other works, the developed advanced
robot calibration technique is suitable for geometrical and elastostatic
calibration. The main attention is paid to the model parameters identification
accuracy. To reduce the impact of measurement errors, it is proposed to use
directly position measurements of several points instead of computing
orientation of the end-effector. The proposed approach allows us to avoid the
problem of non-homogeneity of the least-square objective, which arises in the
classical identification technique with the full-pose information. The
developed technique does not require any normalization and can be efficiently
applied both for geometric and elastostatic identification. The advantages of a
new approach are confirmed by comparison analysis that deals with the
efficiency evaluation of different identification strategies. The obtained
results have been successfully applied to the elastostatic parameters
identification of the industrial robot employed in a machining work-cell for
aerospace industry."
"The paper presents an approach for the identification of elasto-static
parameters of a robotic manipulator using the virtual experiments in a CAD
environment. It is based on the numerical processing of the data extracted from
the finite element analysis results, which are obtained for isolated
manipulator links. This approach allows to obtain the desired stiffness
matrices taking into account the complex shape of the links, couplings between
rotational/translational deflections and particularities of the joints
connecting adjacent links. These matrices are integral parts of the manipulator
lumped stiffness model that are widely used in robotics due to its high
computational efficiency. To improve the identification accuracy,
recommendations for optimal settings of the virtual experiments are given, as
well as relevant statistical processing techniques are proposed. Efficiency of
the developed approach is confirmed by a simulation study that shows that the
accuracy in evaluating the stiffness matrix elements is about 0.1%."
"The paper focuses on the stiffness modeling of robotic manipulators with
gravity compensators. The main attention is paid to the development of the
stiffness model of a spring-based compensator located between sequential links
of a serial structure. The derived model allows us to describe the compensator
as an equivalent non-linear virtual spring integrated in the corresponding
actuated joint. The obtained results have been efficiently applied to the
stiffness modeling of a heavy industrial robot of the Kuka family."
"The paper focuses on the stiffness modeling of heavy industrial robots with
gravity compensators. The main attention is paid to the identification of
geometrical and elastostatic parameters and calibration accuracy. To reduce
impact of the measurement errors, the set of manipulator configurations for
calibration experiments is optimized with respect to the proposed performance
measure related to the end-effector position accuracy. Experimental results are
presented that illustrate the advantages of the developed technique."
"We analyze the observability of motion estimates from the fusion of visual
and inertial sensors. Because the model contains unknown parameters, such as
sensor biases, the problem is usually cast as a mixed identification/filtering,
and the resulting observability analysis provides a necessary condition for any
algorithm to converge to a unique point estimate. Unfortunately, most models
treat sensor bias rates as noise, independent of other states including biases
themselves, an assumption that is patently violated in practice. When this
assumption is lifted, the resulting model is not observable, and therefore past
analyses cannot be used to conclude that the set of states that are
indistinguishable from the measurements is a singleton. In other words, the
resulting model is not observable. We therefore re-cast the analysis as one of
sensitivity: Rather than attempting to prove that the indistinguishable set is
a singleton, which is not the case, we derive bounds on its volume, as a
function of characteristics of the input and its sufficient excitation. This
provides an explicit characterization of the indistinguishable set that can be
used for analysis and validation purposes."
"This paper studies the problem of having mobile robots in a multi-robot
system maintain an estimate of the relative position and relative orientation
of near-by robots in the environment. This problem is studied in the context of
large swarms of simple robots which are capable of measuring only the distance
to near-by robots.
  We present two distributed localization algorithms with different trade-offs
between their computational complexity and their coordination requirements. The
first algorithm does not require the robots to coordinate their motion. It
relies on a non-linear least squares based strategy to allow robots to compute
the relative pose of near-by robots. The second algorithm borrows tools from
distributed computing theory to coordinate which robots must remain stationary
and which robots are allowed to move. This coordination allows the robots to
use standard trilateration techniques to compute the relative pose of near-by
robots. Both algorithms are analyzed theoretically and validated through
simulations."
"The problem of maintaining a wireless communication link between a fixed base
station and an autonomous agent by means of a team of mobile robots is
addressed in this work. Such problem can be of interest for search and rescue
missions in post disaster scenario where the autonomous agent can be used for
remote monitoring and first hand knowledge of the aftermath, while the mobile
robots can be used to provide the agent the possibility to dynamically send its
collected information to an external base station. To study the problem, a
distributed multi-robot system with wifi communication capabilities has been
developed and used to implement a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) to guarantee
the required multi-hop communication. None of the robots of the team possess
the knowledge of agent's movement, neither they hold a pre-assigned position in
the ad-hoc network but they adapt with respect to the dynamic environmental
situations. This adaptation only requires the robots to have the knowledge of
their position and the possibility to exchange such information with their
one-hop neighbours. Robots' motion is achieved by implementing a behavioural
control, namely the Null-Space based Behavioural control, embedding the
collective mission to achieve the required self-configuration. Validation of
the approach is performed by means of demanding experimental tests involving
five ground mobile robots capable of self localization and dynamic obstacle
avoidance."
"Mobile robots dedicated in security tasks should be capable of clearly
perceiving their environment to competently navigate within cluttered areas, so
as to accomplish their assigned mission. The paper in hand describes such an
autonomous agent designed to deploy competently in hazardous environments
equipped with a laser scanner sensor. During the robot's motion, consecutive
scans are obtained to produce dense 3D maps of the area. A 3D point cloud
registration technique is exploited to merge the successively created maps
during the robot's motion followed by an ICP refinement step. The reconstructed
3D area is then top-down projected with great resolution, to be fed in a path
planning algorithm suitable to trace obstacle-free trajectories in the explored
area. The main characteristic of the path planner is that the robot's
embodiment is considered for producing detailed and safe trajectories of $1$
$cm$ resolution. The proposed method has been evaluated with our mobile robot
in several outdoor scenarios revealing remarkable performance."
"The purpose of this paper is to explore a new way of autonomous mapping.
Current systems using perception techniques like LAZER or SONAR use
probabilistic methods and have a drawback of allowing considerable uncertainty
in the mapping process. Our approach is to break down the environment,
specifically indoor, into reachable areas and objects, separated by boundaries,
and identifying their shape, to render various navigable paths around them.
This is a novel method to do away with uncertainties, as far as possible, at
the cost of temporal efficiency. Also this system demands only minimum and
cheap hardware, as it relies on only Infra-Red sensors to do the job."
"Two challenges for rescue robots are to detect human beings and to have an
accurate positioning system. In indoor positioning, GPS receivers cannot be
used due to the reflections or attenuation caused by obstacles. To detect human
beings, sensors such as thermal camera, ultrasonic and microphone can be
embedded on the rescue robot. The drawback of these sensors is the detection
range. These sensors have to be in close proximity to the victim in order to
detect it. UWB technology is then very helpful to ensure precise localization
of the rescue robot inside the disaster site and detect human beings.
  We propose a new method to both detect human beings and locate the rescue
robot at the same time. To achieve these goals we optimize the design of UWB
pulses based on B-splines. The spectral effectiveness is optimized so the
symbols are easier to detect and the mitigation with noise is reduced. Our
positioning system performs to locate the rescue robot with an accuracy about 2
centimeters. During some tests we discover that UWB signal characteristics
abruptly change after passing through a human body. Our system uses this
particular signature to detect human body."
"This research proposed an intelligent obstacle avoidance algorithm to
navigate an autonomous mobile robot. The presented Intelligent Bug Algorithm
(IBA) over performs and reaches the goal in relatively less time as compared to
existing Bug algorithms. The improved algorithm offers a goal oriented strategy
by following smooth and short trajectory. This has been achieved by
continuously considering the goal position during obstacle avoidance. The
proposed algorithm is computationally inexpensive and easy to tune. The paper
also presents the performance comparison of IBA and reported Bug algorithms.
Simulation results of robot navigation in an environment with obstacles
demonstrate the performance of the improved algorithm."
"In the context of search and rescue, we consider the problem of mission
planning for heterogeneous teams that can include human, robotic, and animal
agents. The problem is tackled using a mixed integer mathematical programming
formulation that jointly determines the path and the activity scheduling of
each agent in the team. Based on the mathematical formulation, we propose the
use of soft constraints and penalties that allow the flexible strategic control
of spatio-temporal relations among the search trajectories of the agents. In
this way, we can enable the mission planner to obtain solutions that maximize
the area coverage and, at the same time, control the spatial proximity among
the agents (e.g., to minimize mutual task interference, or to promote local
cooperation and data sharing). Through simulation experiments, we show the
application of the strategic framework considering a number of scenarios of
interest for real-world search and rescue missions."
"The Fourth International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and Models for
Robotic Systems (DSLRob'13) was held in conjunction with the 2013 IEEE/RSJ
International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2013),
November 2013 in Tokyo, Japan.
  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain
that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Model-driven software development offers a
high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at
the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain."
"Finding the Time-Optimal Parameterization of a given Path (TOPP) subject to
kinodynamic constraints is an essential component in many robotic theories and
applications. The objective of this article is to provide a general, fast and
robust implementation of this component. For this, we give a complete solution
to the issue of dynamic singularities, which are the main cause of failure in
existing implementations. We then present an open-source implementation of the
algorithm in C++/Python and demonstrate its robustness and speed in various
robotics settings."
"One of the defining features of the field of robotics is its breadth and
heterogeneity. Unfortunately, despite the availability of several robotics
middleware services, robotics software still fails to smoothly handle at least
two kinds of variability: algorithmic variability and lower-level variability.
The consequence is that implementations of algorithms are hard to understand
and impacted by changes to lower-level details such as the choice or
configuration of sensors or actuators. Moreover, when several algorithms or
algorithmic variants are available it is difficult to compare and combine them.
  In order to alleviate these problems we propose a top-down approach to
express and implement robotics algorithms and families of algorithms so that
they are both less dependent on lower-level details and easier to understand
and combine. This approach goes top-down from the algorithms and shields them
from lower-level details by introducing very high level abstractions atop the
intermediate abstractions of robotics middleware. This approach is illustrated
on 7 variants of the Bug family that were implemented using both laser and
infra-red sensors."
"This paper presents a novel method for qualitative mapping of large scale
spaces. The proposed framework makes use of a graphical representation of the
world in order to build a map consisting of qualitative constraints on the
geometric relationships between landmark triplets. A novel measurement method
based on camera imagery is presented which extends previous work from the field
of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning. Measurements are fused into the map using a
deterministic, iterative graph update. A Branch-and-Bound approach is taken to
solve a set of non-convex feasibility problems required for generating on-line
measurements and off-line operator lookup tables. A navigation approach for
travel between distant landmarks is developed, using estimates of the Relative
Neighborhood Graph extracted from the qualitative map in order to generate a
sequence of landmark objectives based on proximity. Average and asymptotic
performance of the mapping algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo tests on
randomly generated maps, and data-driven simulation results are presented for a
robot traversing the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Mars Yard while building a
relational map. Simulation results demonstrate an initial rapid convergence of
qualitative state estimates for visible landmarks, followed by a slow tapering
as the remaining ambiguous states are removed from the map."
"This paper investigates manipulation of multiple unknown objects in a crowded
environment. Because of incomplete knowledge due to unknown objects and
occlusions in visual observations, object observations are imperfect and action
success is uncertain, making planning challenging. We model the problem as a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which allows a general
reward based optimization objective and takes uncertainty in temporal evolution
and partial observations into account. In addition to occlusion dependent
observation and action success probabilities, our POMDP model also
automatically adapts object specific action success probabilities. To cope with
the changing system dynamics and performance constraints, we present a new
online POMDP method based on particle filtering that produces compact policies.
The approach is validated both in simulation and in physical experiments in a
scenario of moving dirty dishes into a dishwasher. The results indicate that:
1) a greedy heuristic manipulation approach is not sufficient, multi-object
manipulation requires multi-step POMDP planning, and 2) on-line planning is
beneficial since it allows the adaptation of the system dynamics model based on
actual experience."
"In this paper the investigation is placed on the hierarchic neuro-fuzzy
systems as a possible solution for biped control. An hierarchic controller for
biped is presented, it includes several sub-controllers and the whole structure
is generated using the adaptive Neuro-fuzzy method. The proposed hierarchic
system focus on the key role that the centre of mass position plays in biped
robotics, the system sub-controllers generate their outputs taken into
consideration the position of that key point."
"Cumulative local muscle fatigue may lead to potential musculoskeletal
disorder (MSD) risks {\color{red}, and subject-specific muscle fatigability
needs to be considered to reduce potential MSD risks.} This study was conducted
to determine local muscle fatigue rate at shoulder joint level based on an
exponential function derived from a muscle fatigue model. Forty male subjects
participated in a fatiguing operation under a static posture with a range of
relative force levels (14% - 33%). Remaining maximum muscle strengths were
measured after different fatiguing sessions. The time course of strength
decline was fitted to the exponential function. Subject-specific fatigue rates
of shoulder joint moment strength were determined. Good correspondence
($R^2>0.8$) was found in the regression of the majority (35 out of 40
subjects). Substantial inter-individual variability in fatigue rate was found
and discussed."
"We propose a novel non-linear extension to the Orienteering Problem (OP),
called the Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP). We use COP to model the
planning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporal
field with time-invariant spatial correlations, in which the tours are
constrained to have limited length. Our focus in this paper is QCOP a quadratic
COP formulation that only looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in a
node network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility function
capturing the said spatial correlation. QCOP may be solved using mixed integer
quadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable of
planning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. In
particular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a network
with up to $150$ nodes. Besides performing extensive simulation studies to
verify the algorithm's correctness and characterize its performance, we also
successfully applied it to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i)
estimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal field, and (ii) estimating the
temperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts."
"We present design and implementation of a chain of particles that can be
programmed to fold the chain into a given curve. The particles guide an
external force to fold, therefore the particles are simple and amenable for
miniaturization. A chain can consist of a large number of such particles. Using
multiple of these chains, a shape-shifting display can be constructed that
folds its initially flat surface to approximate a given 3D shape that can be
touched and modified by users, for example, enabling architects to
interactively view, touch, and modify a 3D model of a building."
"We present a method for system identification of flexible objects by
measuring forces and displacement during interaction with a manipulating arm.
We model the object's structure and flexibility by a chain of rigid bodies
connected by torsional springs. Unlike previous work, the proposed optimal
control approach using variational integrators allows identification of closed
loops, which include the robot arm itself. This allows using the resulting
models for planning in configuration space of the robot. In order to solve the
resulting problem efficiently, we develop a novel method for fast discrete-time
adjoint-based gradient calculation. The feasibility of the approach is
demonstrated using full physics simulation in trep and using data recorded from
a 7-DOF series elastic robot arm."
"The development of the works of the author about adaptive algorithms of
teaching the robotic systems with the help of operator is described here. An
operator is assumed to be an experience decision-maker and sane carrier of a
target which the robotic system needs to achieve. The works characteristic is
that the behavior of the robotic system is not specified a priori (as standard)
but is formed adaptively based on the information about the situation and
decisions made by a decision-maker. In this scheme the robotic system and the
decision-maker can cooperate in the normal operation mode of the robotic system
or in the time sharing mode with the possibility to plan actively the
experiment on the robotic system. If the adaptive scheme is chosen, there are
teaching stages and operating stages of the robotic system. At that the
decision-maker can act slowly having the possibility to weigh the decision
made. This way allows the robotic system reacting flexibly by switching between
preset models and respond to the environment instability. The data integrity
about the environment condition and about target preferences of an operator
plays a very important role in robotic system work. The effective work of the
robotic system depends on the effective settings of a preference model of the
robotic system based on the decisions of the decision-maker and on the
effective control. The influence of settings and control factors on the index
of effectiveness of the robotic system is subject of this work. The uncertainty
may be caused by the data flow limitation received by the operator on the stage
of the model setting."

"Micro- and nanorobotics have the potential to revolutionize many applications
including targeted material delivery, assembly, and surgery. The same
properties that promise breakthrough solutions---small size and large
populations---present unique challenges to generating controlled motion. We
want to use large swarms of robots to perform manipulation tasks;
unfortunately, human-swarm interaction studies as conducted today are limited
in sample size, are difficult to reproduce, and are prone to hardware failures.
We present an alternative.
  This paper examines the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities we discovered by
launching SwarmControl.net, an online game where players steer swarms of up to
500 robots to complete manipulation challenges. We record statistics from
thousands of players, and use the game to explore aspects of large-population
robot control. We present the game framework as a new, open-source tool for
large-scale user experiments. Our results have potential applications in human
control of micro- and nanorobots, supply insight for automatic controllers, and
provide a template for large online robotic research experiments."
"Micro- and nanorobots are often controlled by global input signals, such as
an electromagnetic or gravitational field. These fields move each robot
maximally until it hits a stationary obstacle or another stationary robot. This
paper investigates 2D motion-planning complexity for large swarms of simple
mobile robots (such as bacteria, sensors, or smart building material).
  In previous work we proved it is NP-hard to decide whether a given initial
configuration can be transformed into a desired target configuration; in this
paper we prove a stronger result: the problem of finding an optimal control
sequence is PSPACE-complete. On the positive side, we show we can build useful
systems by designing obstacles. We present a reconfigurable hardware platform
and demonstrate how to form arbitrary permutations and build a compact absolute
encoder. We then take the same platform and use dual-rail logic to build a
universal logic gate that concurrently evaluates AND, NAND, NOR and OR
operations. Using many of these gates and appropriate interconnects we can
evaluate any logical expression."
"This paper uses the smoothing and mapping framework to solve the SLAM problem
in indoor environments; focusing on how some key issues such as feature
extraction and data association can be handled by applying probabilistic
techniques. For feature extraction, an odds ratio approach to find multiple
lines from laser scans is proposed, this criterion allows to decide which model
must be merged and to output the best number of models. In addition, to solve
the data association problem a method based on the segments of each line is
proposed. Experimental results show that high quality indoor maps can be
obtained from noisy data"
"Presented in this paper is an actuator concept, called a Parallel
Force/Velocity Actuator (PFVA), that combines two fundamentally distinct
actuators (one using low gear reduction or even direct drive, which we will
call a Force Actuator (FA) and the other with a high reduction gear train that
we will refer to as a Velocity Actuator (VA)). The objective of this work is to
evaluate the effect of the relative scale factor, RSF, (ratio of gear
reductions) between these inputs on their dynamic coupling. We conceptually
describe a Parallel Force/Velocity Actuator (PFVA) based on a
Dual-Input-Single- Output (DISO) epicyclic gear train. We then present an
analytical formulation for the variation of the dynamic coupling term w.r.t.
RSF. Conclusions from this formulation are illustrated through a numerical
example involving a 1-DOF four-bar linkage. It is shown, both analytically and
numerically, that as we increase the RSF, the two inputs to the PFVA are
decoupled w.r.t. the inertia torques. This understanding can serve as an
important design guideline for PFVAs. The paper also presents two limitations
of this study and suggests future work based on these caveats."
"This paper introduces a framework for state estimation on a humanoid robot
platform using only common proprioceptive sensors and knowledge of leg
kinematics. The presented approach extends that detailed in [1] on a quadruped
platform by incorporating the rotational constraints imposed by the humanoid's
flat feet. As in previous work, the proposed Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
accommodates contact switching and makes no assumptions about gait or terrain,
making it applicable on any humanoid platform for use in any task. The filter
employs a sensor-based prediction model which uses inertial data from an IMU
and corrects for integrated error using a kinematics-based measurement model
which relies on joint encoders and a kinematic model to determine the relative
position and orientation of the feet. A nonlinear observability analysis is
performed on both the original and updated filters and it is concluded that the
new filter significantly simplifies singular cases and improves the
observability characteristics of the system. Results on simulated walking and
squatting datasets demonstrate the performance gain of the flat-foot filter as
well as confirm the results of the presented observability analysis."
"To rationalize the relatively high investment that industrial automation
systems entail, research in the field of intelligent machines should target
high value functions such as fettling, die-finishing, deburring, and
fixtureless manufacturing. For achieving this goal, past work has concentrated
on force control algorithms at the system level with limited focus on
performance expansion at the actuator level. We present a comprehensive
literature review on robot force control, including algorithms, specialized
actuators, and robot control software. A robot force control testbed was
developed using Schunk's PowerCube 6-DOF Arm and a six-axis ATI force/torque
sensor. Using parameter identification experiments, manipulator module inertias
and the motor torque constant were estimated. Experiments were conducted to
study the practical issues involved in implementing stable contact transitions
and programmable endpoint impedance. Applications to human augmentation,
virtual fixtures, and teleoperation are discussed. These experiments are used
as a vehicle to understand the performance improvement achievable at the
actuator level. The approach at UTRRG has been to maximize the choices within
the actuator to enhance its intelligence. Drawing on this 20-year research
history in electromechanical actuator architecture, we propose a new concept
that mixes two inputs, distinct in their velocity ratios, within the same dual
actuator called a Force/Motion Actuator (FMA). Detailed kinematic and dynamic
models of this dual actuator are developed. The actuator performance is
evaluated using simulations with an output velocity specification and resolving
input trajectories using a minimum-norm solution. It is shown that a design
choice of 14:1 motion scaling between the two inputs results in good
sensitivity to output force disturbances without compromising velocity tracking
performance."
"In this paper we introduce the concept of an agile electronic pest control
intelligent device for commercial usage and we have evaluated its performance
in comparison with other existing similar technologies. The frequency and
intensities are changed with respect to the target pest however human behavior
has been found to be inert with their exposure. The unit has been tested in lab
conditions as well as field testing done have given encouraging results. The
device can be a standalone unit and hence work for small scale viz. kitchen
garden on the other hand multiple devices acting in coordination with each
other give the desired output on a larger scale."
"The number of tools for dynamics simulation has grown in the last years. It
is necessary for the robotics community to have elements to ponder which of the
available tools is the best for their research. As a complement to an objective
and quantitative comparison, difficult to obtain since not all the tools are
open-source, an element of evaluation is user feedback. With this goal in mind,
we created an online survey about the use of dynamical simulation in robotics.
This paper reports the analysis of the participants' answers and a descriptive
information fiche for the most relevant tools. We believe this report will be
helpful for roboticists to choose the best simulation tool for their
researches."
"Bipedal locomotion is a phenomenon that still eludes a fundamental and
concise mathematical understanding. Conceptual models that capture some
relevant aspects of the process exist but their full explanatory power is not
yet exhausted. In the current study, we introduce the robustness criterion
which defines the conditions for stable locomotion when steps are taken with
imprecise angle of attack. Intuitively, the necessity of a higher precision
indicates the difficulty to continue moving with a given gait. We show that the
spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, under the robustness criterion, is
consistent with previously reported findings on attentional demand during human
locomotion. This criterion allows transitions between running and walking, many
of which conserve forward speed. Simulations of transitions predict Froude
numbers below the ones observed in humans, nevertheless the model
satisfactorily reproduces several biomechanical indicators such as hip
excursion, gait duty factor and vertical ground reaction force profiles.
Furthermore, we identify reversible robust walk-run transitions, which allow
the system to execute a robust version of the hopping gait. These findings
foster the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model as the unifying framework for
the understanding of bipedal locomotion."
"Having non-singular assembly modes changing trajectories for the 3-RPS
parallel robot is a well-known feature. The only known solution for defining
such trajectory is to encircle a cusp point in the joint space. In this paper,
the aspects and the characteristic surfaces are computed for each operation
mode to define the uniqueness of the domains. Thus, we can easily see in the
workspace that at least three assembly modes can be reached for each operation
mode. To validate this property, the mathematical analysis of the determinant
of the Jacobian is done. The image of these trajectories in the joint space is
depicted with the curves associated with the cusp points."
"Motion planning under differential constraints is a classic problem in
robotics. To date, the state of the art is represented by sampling-based
techniques, with the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm as a leading
example. Yet, the problem is still open in many aspects, including guarantees
on the quality of the obtained solution. In this paper we provide a thorough
theoretical framework to assess optimality guarantees of sampling-based
algorithms for planning under differential constraints. We exploit this
framework to design and analyze two novel sampling-based algorithms that are
guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an optimal
solution (namely, the Differential Probabilistic RoadMap algorithm and the
Differential Fast Marching Tree algorithm). Our focus is on driftless
control-affine dynamical models, which accurately model a large class of
robotic systems. In this paper we use the notion of convergence in probability
(as opposed to convergence almost surely): the extra mathematical flexibility
of this approach yields convergence rate bounds - a first in the field of
optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints.
Numerical experiments corroborating our theoretical results are presented and
discussed."
"We study the problem of control synthesis for multi-agent systems, to achieve
complex, high-level, long-term goals that are assigned to each agent
individually. As the agents might not be capable of satisfying their respective
goals by themselves, requests for other agents' collaborations are a part of
the task descriptions. Particularly, we consider that the task specification
takes a form of a linear temporal logic formula, which may contain requirements
and constraints on the other agent's behavior. A traditional automata-based
approach to multi-agent strategy synthesis from such specifications builds on
centralized planning for the whole team and thus suffers from extreme
computational demands. In this work, we aim at reducing the computational
complexity by decomposing the strategy synthesis problem into short horizon
planning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents. We
discuss the correctness of the solution and find assumptions, under which the
proposed iterative algorithm leads to provable eventual satisfaction of the
desired specifications."
"Motion planning has been studied for nearly four decades now. Complete,
combinatorial motion planning approaches are theoretically well-rooted with
completeness guarantees but they are hard to implement. Sampling-based and
heuristic methods are easy to implement and quite simple to customize but they
lack completeness guarantees. Can the best of both worlds be ever achieved,
particularly for mission critical applications such as robotic surgery, space
explorations, and handling hazardous material? In this paper, we answer
affirmatively to that question. We present a new methodology, NUROA, to
numerically approximate the Canny's roadmap, which is a network of
one-dimensional algebraic curves. Our algorithm encloses the roadmap with a
chain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap and whose
connectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. It starts by enclosing the
entire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all
sides and then split into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are
detected in the shrink phase and removed. The algorithm terminates when all
remaining boxes are smaller than a resolution that can be either given as input
or automatically computed using root separation lower bounds. Shrink operation
is cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is
in turn transformed into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the
Lasserre's approach. NUROA's success is due to fast SDP solvers. NUROA
correctly captured the connectivity of multiple curves/skeletons whereas
competitors such as IBEX and Realpaver failed in some cases. Since boxes are
independent from one another, NUROA can be parallelized particularly on GPUs.
NUROA is available as an open source package at http://nuroa.sourceforge.net/."
"The NUbots team, from The University of Newcastle, Australia, has had a
strong record of success in the RoboCup Standard Platform League since first
entering in 2002. The team has also competed within the RoboCup Humanoid
Kid-Size League since 2012. The 2014 team brings a renewed focus on software
architecture, modularity, and the ability to easily share code. This paper
summarizes the history of the NUbots team, describes the roles and research of
the team members, gives an overview of the NUbots' robots and software system,
and addresses relevant research projects within the the Newcastle Robotics
Laboratory."
"Many path-finding algorithms on graphs such as A* are sped up by using a
heuristic function that gives lower bounds on the cost to reach the goal.
Aiming to apply similar techniques to speed up sampling-based motion-planning
algorithms, we use effective lower bounds on the cost between configurations to
tightly estimate the cost-to-go. We then use these estimates in an anytime
asymptotically-optimal algorithm which we call Motion Planning using Lower
Bounds (MPLB). MPLB is based on the Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) algorithm
recently presented by Janson and Pavone. An advantage of our approach is that
in many cases (especially as the number of samples grows) the weight of
collision detection in the computation is almost negligible with respect to
nearest-neighbor calls. We prove that MPLB performs no more collision-detection
calls than an anytime version of FMT*. Additionally, we demonstrate in
simulations that for certain scenarios, the algorithmic tools presented here
enable efficiently producing low-cost paths while spending only a small
fraction of the running time on collision detection."
"In this paper, we propose a compliant motion control strategy for handling a
single object by two similar industrial robots. The dynamics of the object
carried by the two robots is assimilated to the dynamics of a
mass-spring-damper system described by a piecewise linear model (PWA). The
coordination of the two robots is accomplished using a master slave
synchronization approach dedicated for PWA systems, based on the Lyapunov
theory, and solved via Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The performances of
the proposed approach are proved by simulation results and compared to a
related approach."
"In this paper, a novel robust tracking control law is proposed for
constrained robots under unknown stiffness environment. The stability and the
robustness of the controller are proved using a Lyapunov-based approach where
the relationship between the error dynamics of the robotic system and its
energy is investigated. Finally, a 3DOF constrained robotic arm is used to
prove the stability, the robustness and the safety of the proposed approach."
"In this study, we show that a movement policy can be improved efficiently
using the previous experiences of a real robot. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is
becoming a popular approach to acquire a nonlinear optimal policy through trial
and error. However, it is considered very difficult to apply RL to real robot
control since it usually requires many learning trials. Such trials cannot be
executed in real environments because unrealistic time is necessary and the
real system's durability is limited. Therefore, in this study, instead of
executing many learning trials, we propose to use a recently developed RL
algorithm, importance-weighted PGPE, by which the robot can efficiently reuse
previously sampled data to improve it's policy parameters. We apply
importance-weighted PGPE to CB-i, our real humanoid robot, and show that it can
learn a target reaching movement and a cart-pole swing up movement in a real
environment without using any prior knowledge of the task or any carefully
designed initial trajectory."
"In this paper, the dynamic modeling of a seven linked humanoid robot, is
accurately developed, in the three dimensional space using the Newton-Euler
formalism. The aim of this study is to provide a clear and a systematic
approach so that starting from generalized motion equations of all rigid bodies
of the humanoid robot one can establish a reduced dynamical model. The
resulting model can be expended either for simulation propositions or
implemented for any given control law. In addition, transformations and
developments, proposed here, can be exploited for modeling any other
three-dimensional humanoid robot with a different morphology and variable
number of rigid bodies and degrees of freedom."
"Over the last 20 years significant effort has been dedicated to the
development of sampling-based motion planning algorithms such as the
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and its asymptotically optimal version
(e.g. RRT*). However, asymptotic optimality for RRT* only holds for linear and
fully actuated systems or for a small number of non-linear systems (e.g.
Dubin's car) for which a steering function is available. The purpose of this
paper is to show that asymptotically optimal motion planning for dynamical
systems with differential constraints can be achieved without the use of a
steering function. We develop a novel analysis on sampling-based planning
algorithms that sample the control space. This analysis demonstrated that
asymptotically optimal path planning for any Lipschitz continuous dynamical
system can be achieved by sampling the control space directly. We also
determine theoretical bounds on the convergence rates for this class of
algorithms. As the number of iterations increases, the trajectory generated by
these algorithms, approaches the optimal control trajectory, with probability
one. Simulation results are promising."
"Humanoid robots are designed to operate in human centered environments where
they execute a multitude of challenging tasks, each differing in complexity,
resource requirements, and execution time. In such highly dynamic surroundings
it is desirable to anticipate upcoming situations in order to predict future
resource requirements such as CPU or memory usage. Resource prediction
information is essential for detecting upcoming resource bottlenecks or
conflicts and can be used enhance resource negotiation processes or to perform
speculative resource allocation.
  In this paper we present a prediction model based on Markov chains for
predicting the behavior of the humanoid robot ARMAR-III in human robot
interaction scenarios. Robot state information required by the prediction
algorithm is gathered through self-monitoring and combined with environmental
context information. Adding resource profiles allows generating probability
distributions of possible future resource demands. Online learning of model
parameters is made possible through disclosure mechanisms provided by the robot
framework ArmarX."
"The aim of this work is to build a cognitive model for the humanoid robot,
especially, we are interested in the navigation and mapping on the humanoid
robot. The agents used are the Alderbaran NAO robot. The framework is
effectively applied to the integration of AI, computer vision, and signal
processing problems. Our model can be divided into two parts, cognitive mapping
and perception. Cognitive mapping is assumed as three parts, whose
representations were proposed a network of ASRs, an MFIS, and a hierarchy of
Place Representations. On the other hand, perception is the traditional
computer vision problem, which is the image sensing, feature extraction and
interested objects tracking. The points of our project can be concluded as the
following. Firstly, the robotics should realize where it is. Second, we would
like to test the theory that this is how humans map their environment. The
humanoid robot inspires the human vision searching by integrating the visual
mechanism and computer vision techniques."
"In this paper, a simple trajectory generation method for biped walking is
proposed. The dynamic model of the five link bipedal robot is first reduced
using several biologically inspired assumptions. A sinusoidal curve is then
imposed to the ankle of the swing leg's trajectory. The reduced model is
finally obtained and solved: it is an homogeneous second order differential
equations with constant coefficients. The algebraic solution obtained ensures a
stable rhythmic gait for the bipedal robot. It's continuous in the defined time
interval, easy to implement when the boundary conditions are well defined."
"The present research as described in this paper tries to impart how imitation
based learning for behavior-based programming can be used to teach the robot.
This development is a big step in way to prove that push recovery is a software
engineering problem and not hardware engineering problem. The walking algorithm
used here aims to select a subset of push recovery problem i.e. disturbance
from environment. We applied the physics at each joint of Halo with some degree
of freedom. The proposed model, Halo is different from other models as
previously developed model were inconsistent with data for different persons.
This would lead to development of the generalized biped model in future and
will bridge the gap between performance and inconsistency. In this paper the
proposed model is applied to data of different persons. Accuracy of model,
performance and result is measured using the behavior negotiation capability of
model developed. In order to improve the performance, proposed model gives the
freedom to handle each joint independently based on the belongingness value for
each joint. The development can be considered as important development for
future world of robotics. The accuracy of model is 70% in one go."
"Human can negotiate and recovers from Push up to certain extent. The push
recovery capability grows with age (a child has poor push recovery than an
adult) and it is based on learning. A wrestler, for example, has better push
recovery than an ordinary man. However, the mechanism of reactive push recovery
is not known to us. We tried to understand the human learning mechanism by
conducting several experiments. The subjects for the experiments were selected
both as right handed and left handed. Pushes were induced from the behind with
close eyes to observe the motor action as well as with open eyes to observe
learning based reactive behaviors. Important observations show that the left
handed and right handed persons negotiate pushes differently (in opposite
manner). The present research describes some details about the experiments and
the analyses of the results mainly obtained from the joint angle variations
(both for ankle and hip joints) as the manifestation of perturbation. After
smoothening the captured data through higher order polynomials, we feed them to
our model which was developed exploiting the physics of an inverted pendulum
and configured it as a representative of the subjects in the Webot simulation
framework available in our laboratory. In each cases the model also could
recover from the push for the same rage of perturbation which proves the
correctness of the model. Hence the model now can provide greater insight to
push recovery mechanism and can be used for determining push recovery strategy
for humanoid robots. The paper claimed the push recovery is software
engineering problem rather than hardware."
"To plan safe trajectories in urban environments, autonomous vehicles must be
able to quickly assess the future intentions of dynamic agents. Pedestrians are
particularly challenging to model, as their motion patterns are often uncertain
and/or unknown a priori. This paper presents a novel changepoint detection and
clustering algorithm that, when coupled with offline unsupervised learning of a
Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), enables quick detection of changes in
intent and online learning of motion patterns not seen in prior training data.
The resulting long-term movement predictions demonstrate improved accuracy
relative to offline learning alone, in terms of both intent and trajectory
prediction. By embedding these predictions within a chance-constrained motion
planner, trajectories which are probabilistically safe to pedestrian motions
can be identified in real-time. Hardware experiments demonstrate that this
approach can accurately predict pedestrian motion patterns from onboard
sensor/perception data and facilitate robust navigation within a dynamic
environment."
"In this paper, we present Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), a planning algorithm
based on unifying graph- and sampling-based planning techniques. By recognizing
that a set of samples describes an implicit random geometric graph (RGG), we
are able to combine the efficient ordered nature of graph-based techniques,
such as A*, with the anytime scalability of sampling-based algorithms, such as
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).
  BIT* uses a heuristic to efficiently search a series of increasingly dense
implicit RGGs while reusing previous information. It can be viewed as an
extension of incremental graph-search techniques, such as Lifelong Planning A*
(LPA*), to continuous problem domains as well as a generalization of existing
sampling-based optimal planners. It is shown that it is probabilistically
complete and asymptotically optimal.
  We demonstrate the utility of BIT* on simulated random worlds in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^8$ and manipulation problems on CMU's HERB, a
14-DOF two-armed robot. On these problems, BIT* finds better solutions faster
than RRT, RRT*, Informed RRT*, and Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) with faster
anytime convergence towards the optimum, especially in high dimensions."
"Building trajectories for biped robot walking is a complex task considering
all degrees of freedom (DOFs) commonly bound within the mechanical structure. A
typical problem for such robots is the instability produced by violent
transitions between walking phases in particular when a swinging leg impacts
the surface. Although extensive research on novel efficient walking algorithms
has been conducted, falls commonly appear as the walking speed increases or as
the terrain condition changes. This paper presents a polynomial trajectory
generation algorithm (PTA) to implement the walking on biped robots following
the cubic Hermitian polynomial interpolation between initial and final
conditions. The proposed algorithm allows smooth transitions between walking
phases, significantly reducing the possibility of falling. The algorithm has
been successfully tested by generating walking trajectories under different
terrain conditions on a biped robot of 10 DOFs. PTA has shown to be simple and
suitable to generate real time walking trajectories, despite reduced computing
resources of a commercial embedded microcontroller. Experimental evidence and
comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods demonstrates a better performance
of the proposed method in generating walking trajectories under different
ground conditions."
"In this paper we provide a thorough, rigorous theoretical framework to assess
optimality guarantees of sampling-based algorithms for drift control systems:
systems that, loosely speaking, can not stop instantaneously due to momentum.
We exploit this framework to design and analyze a sampling-based algorithm (the
Differential Fast Marching Tree algorithm) that is asymptotically optimal, that
is, it is guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an
optimal solution. In addition, our approach allows us to provide concrete
bounds on the rate of this convergence. The focus of this paper is on mixed
time/control energy cost functions and on linear affine dynamical systems,
which encompass a range of models of interest to applications (e.g.,
double-integrators) and represent a necessary step to design, via successive
linearization, sampling-based and provably-correct algorithms for non-linear
drift control systems. Our analysis relies on an original perturbation analysis
for two-point boundary value problems, which could be of independent interest."
"Robots operating in domestic environments generally need to interact with
articulated objects, such as doors, cabinets, dishwashers or fridges. In this
work, we present a novel, probabilistic framework for modeling articulated
objects as kinematic graphs. Vertices in this graph correspond to object parts,
while edges between them model their kinematic relationship. In particular, we
present a set of parametric and non-parametric edge models and how they can
robustly be estimated from noisy pose observations. We furthermore describe how
to estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models
for pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks. We finally present how
the learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects. In
various experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as
in simulation, we show that our approach is valid, accurate and efficient.
Further, we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications, in
particular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics."
"In this paper we give a full classification of all pentapods with mobility 2,
where neither all platform anchor points nor all base anchor points are located
on a line. Therefore this paper solves the famous Borel-Bricard problem for
2-dimensional motions beside the excluded case of five collinear points with
spherical trajectories. But even for this special case we present three new
types as a side-result. Based on our study of pentapods, we also give a
complete list of all non-architecturally singular hexapods with 2-dimensional
self-motions."
"Additive manufacturing brings a variety of new possibilities to the
construction industry, extending the capabilities of existing fabrication
methods whilst also creating new possibilities. Currently three-dimensional
printing is used to produce small-scale objects; large-scale three-dimensional
printing is difficult due to the size of positioning devices and machine
elements. Presently fixed Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) routers and
robotic arms are used to position print-heads. Fixed machines have work
envelope limitations and can't produce objects outside of these limits.
Large-scale three-dimensional printing requires large machines that are costly
to build and hard to transport. This paper presents a compact print-head
positioning device for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) a method of
three-dimensional printing independent from the size of the object it prints."
"Fuzzy controllers have gained popularity in the past few decades with
successful implementations in many fields that have enabled designers to
control complex systems through linguistic-based rules in contrast to
traditional methods. This paper presents an educational platform based on
LEGO\c{opyright} NXT to assist the learning of fuzzy logic control principles
at undergraduate level by providing a simple and easy-to-follow teaching setup.
The proposed fuzzy control study aims to accompany students to the learning of
fuzzy control fundamentals by building hands-on robotic experiments. The
proposed educational platform has been successfully applied to several
undergraduate courses within the Electronics Department in the University of
Guadalajara. The description of robotic experiments and the evaluation of their
impact in the student performance are both provided in the paper."
"This paper addresses the dimensional synthesis of an adaptive mechanism of
contact points ie a leg mechanism of a piping inspection robot operating in an
irradiated area as a nuclear power plant. This studied mechanism is the leading
part of the robot sub-system responsible of the locomotion. Firstly, three
architectures are chosen from the literature and their properties are
described. Then, a method using a multi-objective optimization is proposed to
determine the best architecture and the optimal geometric parameters of a leg
taking into account environmental and design constraints. In this context, the
objective functions are the minimization of the mechanism size and the
maximization of the transmission force factor. Representations of the Pareto
front versus the objective functions and the design parameters are given.
Finally, the CAD model of several solutions located on the Pareto front are
presented and discussed."
"This paper shows the potential of a Lego\c{opyright} based low-cost
commercial robotic platform for learning and testing prototypes in higher
education and research. The overall setup aims to explain mobile robotic issues
strongly related to several fields such as Mechatronics, Robotics, and
Automatic Control theory. The capabilities and limitations of LEGO robots are
studied within two projects. The first one involves a robotic vehicle which is
able to follow several predefined paths. The second project concerns to the
classical problem of position control. Algorithms and additional tools have
been fully designed, applied and documented with results shown throughout the
paper. The platform is found to be suitable for teaching and researching on key
issues related to the aforementioned fields."
"In recent years, Artificial Intelligence techniques have emerged as useful
tools for solving various engineering problems that were not possible or
convenient to handle by traditional methods. AI has directly influenced many
areas of computer science and becomes an important part of the engineering
curriculum. However, determining the important topics for a single semester AI
course is a nontrivial task, given the lack of a general methodology. AI
concepts commonly overlap with many other disciplines involving a wide range of
subjects, including applied approaches to more formal mathematical issues. This
paper presents the use of a simple robotic platform to assist the learning of
basic AI concepts. The study is guided through some simple experiments using
autonomous mobile robots. The central algorithm is the Learning Automata. Using
LA, each robot action is applied to an environment to be evaluated by means of
a fitness value. The response of the environment is used by the automata to
select its next action. This procedure holds until the goal task is reached.
The proposal addresses the AI study by offering in LA a unifying context to
draw together several of the topics of AI and motivating the students to learn
by building some hands on laboratory exercises. The presented material has been
successfully tested as AI teaching aide in the University of Guadalajara
robotics group as it motivates students and increases enrolment and retention
while educating better computer engineers."
"Enabling high speed navigation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in unknown
rough terrain where limited or no information is available in advance requires
the assessment of terrain in front of the UGV. Attempts have been made to
predict the forces the terrain exerts on the UGV for the purpose of determining
the maximum allowable velocity for a given terrain. However, current methods
produce overly aggressive velocity profiles which could damage the UGV. This
paper presents three novel safer methods of force prediction that produce
effective velocity profiles. Two models, Instantaneous Elevation Change Model
(IECM) and Sinusoidal Base Excitation Model: using Excitation Force (SBEM:EF),
predict the forces exerted by the terrain on the vehicle at the ground contact
point, while another method, Sinusoidal Base Excitation Model: using
Transmitted Force (SBEM:TF), predicts the forces transmitted to the vehicle
frame by the suspension."
"This is a documentation of a framework for robot motion optimization that
aims to draw on classical constrained optimization methods. With one exception
the underlying algorithms are classical ones: Gauss-Newton (with adaptive step
size and damping), Augmented Lagrangian, log-barrier, etc. The exception is a
novel any-time version of the Augmented Lagrangian. The contribution of this
framework is to frame motion optimization problems in a way that makes the
application of these methods efficient, especially by defining a very general
class of robot motion problems while at the same time introducing abstractions
that directly reflect the API of the source code."
"In this paper, a new neuronal circuit, based on the spiking neuronal network
model, is proposed in order to detect the movement direction of dynamic objects
wandering around cognitive robots. Capability of our new approach in
bi-directional movement detection is beholden to its symmetric configuration of
the proposed circuit. With due attention to magnificence of handling of
blocking problems in neuronal networks such as epilepsy, mounting both
excitatory and inhibitory stimuli has been taken into account. Investigations
upon applied implementation of aforementioned strategy on PIONEER cognitive
robot reveals that the strategy leads to alleviation of potential level in the
sensory networks. Furthermore, investigation on intrinsic delay of the circuit
reveals not only the noticeable switching rate which could be acquired but the
high-efficient coupling of the circuit with the other high-speed ones."
"Braitenberg vehicles could be mentioned as the seminal elements for cognitive
studies in robotics fields especially neurorobotics to invent more smart
robots. Motion detection of dynamic objects could be taken as one of the most
inspiring abilities into account which can lead to evolve more intelligent
Braitenberg vehicles. In this paper, a new neuronal circuit is established in
order to detect curved movements of the objects wandering around Braitenberg
vehicles. Modular structure of the novel circuit provides the opportunity to
expand the model into huge sensory-biosystems. Furthermore, robust performance
of the circuit against epileptic seizures is beholden to simultaneous
utilization of excitatory and inhibitory stimuli in the circuit construction.
Also, straight movements, as special case of curved movements could be tracked.
PIONEER, with due attention to its suitable neurosensors, is used as a
Braitenberg vehicle for empirical evaluations. Simulated results and practical
experiments are applied to this vehicle in order to verify new achievements of
the curved trajectory detector."
"A well-known weakness of the probabilistic path planners is the so-called
narrow passage problem, where a region with a relatively low probability of
being sampled must be explored to find a solution path. Many strategies have
been proposed to alleviate this problem, most of them based on biasing the
sampling distribution. When kinematic constraints appear in the problem, the
configuration space typically becomes a non-parametrizable, implicit manifold.
Unfortunately, this invalidates most of the existing sampling bias approaches,
which rely on an explicit parametrization of the space to explore. In this
paper, we propose and evaluate three novel strategies to bias the sampling
under the presence of narrow passages in kinematically-constrained systems."
"Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for
high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random
geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved
with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics
requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of
the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical,
to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots
or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even
possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without
access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how
to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental
sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new
methods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are
asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown
to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set
of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of
the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems
benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots."
"Semi or completely autonomous unmanned vehicles, remotely driven or
controlled through artificial intelligence, are instrumental to foster space
exploration. One of the most essential tasks of a rover is terrain traversing
which requires the need of efficient suspension systems. This communication
presents a suspension system giving degrees of freedom to every wheel with the
help of linear actuators connected through bell crank levers. The actuation of
linear actuators directly varies the height of every wheel from the chassis
hence offering articulation to the rover. A control system is developed
offering an algorithm for its autonomous actuation. This system proves
instrumental for leveling of the chassis where any kind of slope, roll or
pitch, may impute abstaining of payloads from efficient working. This was tried
and tested successfully as a part of the rover developed by Team RUDRA from SRM
University, INDIA (first Team from Asia and finishing at the fifth position) at
University Rover Challenge 2013, held at UTAH, USA in May-June."
"We give a full classification of all pentapods with linear platform
possessing a self-motion beside the trivial rotation about the platform. Recent
research necessitates a contemporary and accurate re-examination of old results
on this topic given by Darboux, Mannheim, Duporcq and Bricard, which also takes
the coincidence of platform anchor points into account. For our study we use
bond theory with respect to a novel kinematic mapping for pentapods with linear
platform, beside the method of singular-invariant leg-rearrangements. Based on
our results we design pentapods with linear platform, which have a simplified
direct kinematics concerning their number of (real) solutions."
"The use of the ROS middleware is a growing trend in robotics in general, ROS
and hard real-time embedded systems have however not been easily uniteable
while retaining the same overall communication and processing methodology at
all levels. In this paper we present an approach aimed at tackling the schism
between high-level, flexible software and low-level, real-time software. The
key idea of our approach is to enable software components written for a
high-level publish-subscribe software architecture to be automatically migrated
to a dedicated hardware architecture implemented using programmable logic. Our
approach is based on the Unity framework, a unified software/hardware framework
based on FPGAs for quickly interfacing high-level software to low-level
robotics hardware."
"Robot world model representations are a vital part of robotic applications.
However, there is no support for such representations in model-driven
engineering tool chains. This work proposes a novel Domain Specific Language
(DSL) for robotic world models that are based on the Robot Scene Graph (RSG)
approach. The RSG-DSL can express (a) application specific scene
configurations, (b) semantic scene structures and (c) inputs and outputs for
the computational entities that are loaded into an instance of a world model."
"We continue to consider the question of what language features are needed to
effectively model cyber-physical systems (CPS). In previous work, we proposed
using a core language as a way to study this question, and showed how several
basic aspects of CPS can be modeled clearly in a language with a small set of
constructs. This paper reports on the result of our analysis of two, more
complex, case studies from the domain of rigid body dynamics. The first one, a
quadcopter, illustrates that previously proposed core language can support
larger, more interesting systems than previously shown. The second one, a
serial robot, provides a concrete example of why we should add language support
for static partial derivatives, namely that it would significantly improve the
way models of rigid body dynamics can be expressed."
"In this paper we present our work in progress towards a domain-specific
language called Robot Perception Specification Language (RPSL). RSPL provide
means to specify the expected result (task knowledge) of a Robot Perception
Architecture in a declarative and framework-independent manner."
"To learn object models for robotic manipulation, unsupervised methods cannot
provide accurate object structural information and supervised methods require a
large amount of manually labeled training samples, thus interactive object
segmentation is developed to automate object modeling. In this article, we
formulate a novel dynamic process for interactive object segmentation, and
develop a solution based on particle filter and active learning so that a robot
can manipulate and learn object structures incrementally and automatically. We
demonstrate our method with a humanoidrobot on different types of objects, and
compare its segmentation performancewith established methods on selected
objects. The result shows that our approach allows more accurate object
modeling and reveals richer object structural information."
"The fresh water reservoirs are one of the main power resources of
Pakistan.These water reservoirs are in the form of Tarbela Dam, Mangla Dam,
Bhasha Dam,and Warsak Dam. To estimate the current power capability of the
Dams, the statistical information about the water in the dam has to be clear
and precise. For the purpose of water management monthly or yearly survey of
the dams required. One of the important parameter is to find the water level of
water, which can help us in finding the pressure and flow of water in dams. The
existing surveying systems have some problems, i.e., risky, errors in
measurement and sometimes expensive. Our project has tried a lot to overcome
these flaws and to develop more economical, safe and accurate system for
finding depth values of dams and ponds. The key purpose of Our Project
Autonomous Surveying Boat is to have it log water depths along a predefined set
of points. The Autonomous Surveying Boat floats in water according to
predefined path, getting the coordinates from GPS Sensor and direction is
controlled by using Magnetometer Sensor. It stores its data on SD card as a
text file for later readings. The boat can also be used to find the average
capacity of the dam. The average depth is calculated from the measured depth
values at different set points of the dam. The actual length of the dam is
determined by the magnetometer. The numbers of surveys over the time can help
us in finding the silting ratio in dams.For square dams the length and width of
the dam are measured and the average depth, then using these three parameters
we can estimate the average capacity of the dam.The boat is scalable for
furthered modification if needed."
"This paper proposes techniques to calibrate six-axis force-torque sensors
that can be performed in situ, i.e., without removing the sensor from the
hosting system. We assume that the force-torque sensor is attached to a rigid
body equipped with an accelerometer. Then, the proposed calibration technique
uses the measurements of the accelerometer, but requires neither the knowledge
of the inertial parameters nor the orientation of the rigid body. The proposed
method exploits the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements
of the sensor and the corresponding force-torque. The validation of the
approach is performed by calibrating two six-axis force-torque sensors of the
iCub humanoid robot."
"We consider the problem of multiple agents or robots searching for a target
in the plane. This is motivated by Search and Rescue operations (SAR) in the
high seas which in the past were often performed with several vessels, and more
recently by swarms of aerial drones and/or unmanned surface vessels.
Coordinating such a search in an effective manner is a non trivial task. In
this paper, we develop first an optimal strategy for searching with k robots
starting from a common origin and moving at unit speed. We then apply the
results from this model to more realistic scenarios such as differential search
speeds, late arrival times to the search effort and low probability of
detection under poor visibility conditions. We show that, surprisingly, the
theoretical idealized model still governs the search with certain suitable
minor adaptations."
"We present an experienced-based planning framework called Thunder that learns
to reduce computation time required to solve high-dimensional planning problems
in varying environments. The approach is especially suited for large
configuration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those
found with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using
probabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which
provides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space,
making storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with
respect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past
experience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in
individual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more
opportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of
the experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of
dynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing
query resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom
humanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based
planner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments
with variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that
Thunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning
from scratch. Thunder also uses 98.8% less memory to store its experiences
after 10,000 trials when compared to Lightning. Our framework is implemented
and freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library."
"We present and analyze methods for patrolling an environment with a
distributed swarm of robots. Our approach uses a physical data structure - a
distributed triangulation of the workspace. A large number of stationary
""mapping"" robots cover and triangulate the environment and a smaller number of
mobile ""patrolling"" robots move amongst them. The focus of this work is to
develop, analyze, implement and compare local patrolling policies. We desire
strategies that achieve full coverage, but also produce good coverage frequency
and visitation times. Policies that provide theoretical guarantees for these
quantities have received some attention, but gaps have remained. We present: 1)
A summary of how to achieve coverage by building a triangulation of the
workspace, and the ensuing properties. 2) A description of simple local
policies (LRV, for Least Recently Visited and LFV, for Least Frequently
Visited) for achieving coverage by the patrolling robots. 3) New analytical
arguments why different versions of LRV may require worst case exponential time
between visits of triangles. 4) Analytical evidence that a local implementation
of LFV on the edges of the dual graph is possible in our scenario, and
immensely better in the worst case. 5) Experimental and simulation validation
for the practical usefulness of these policies, showing that even a small
number of weak robots with weak local information can greatly outperform a
single, powerful robots with full information and computational capabilities."
"Curved Trajectory Detection (CTD) process could be considered among
high-level planned capabilities for cognitive agents, has which been acquired
under aegis of embedded artificial spiking neuronal circuits. In this paper,
hard-wired implementation of the cross-correlation, as the most common
comparison-driven scheme for both natural and artificial bionic constructions
named Depth Detection Module(DDM), has been taken into account. It is
manifestation of efficient handling upon epileptic seizures due to application
of both excitatory and inhibitory connections within the circuit structure.
Presented traditional analytic approach of the cross-correlation computation
with regard to our neural mapping technique and the acquired traced precision
have been turned into account for coherent accomplishments of the
aforementioned design in perspective of the desired accuracy upon high-level
cognitive reactions. Furthermore, the proposed circuit could be fitted into the
scalable neuronal network of the CTD, properly. Simulated denouements have been
captured based on the computational model of PIONEER mobile robot to verify
characteristics of the module, in detail."
"We present a new framework for prioritized multi-task motion-force control of
fully-actuated robots. This work is established on a careful review and
comparison of the state of the art. Some control frameworks are not optimal,
that is they do not find the optimal solution for the secondary tasks. Other
frameworks are optimal, but they tackle the control problem at kinematic level,
hence they neglect the robot dynamics and they do not allow for force control.
Still other frameworks are optimal and consider force control, but they are
computationally less efficient than ours. Our final claim is that, for
fully-actuated robots, computing the operational-space inverse dynamics is
equivalent to computing the inverse kinematics (at acceleration level) and then
the joint-space inverse dynamics. Thanks to this fact, our control framework
can efficiently compute the optimal solution by decoupling kinematics and
dynamics of the robot. We take into account: motion and force control, soft and
rigid contacts, free and constrained robots. Tests in simulation validate our
control framework, comparing it with other state-of-the-art equivalent
frameworks and showing remarkable improvements in optimality and efficiency."
"This article presents a novel utilization of the concept of entropy in
information theory to model-free 3D reconstruction of weld joint in presence of
noise. We show that our formulation attains its global minimum at the upper
edge of this joint. This property significantly simplifies the extraction of
this welding joint. Furthermore, we present an approach to compute the volume
of this extracted space to facilitate the monitoring of the progress of the
welding task. Moreover, we provide a preliminary analysis of the effect of
variation of the noise on the extraction process of this space to realize the
impact of this noise on the computation of its area and volume."
"In this paper we have discussed a unique general algorithm for exploring and
solving any kind of line maze with another simple one for simple mazes without
loops or loops having highest two branches none of which are inward. For the
general algorithm, we need a method to map the whole maze, which is required if
the maze is complex. The proposed maze mapping system is based on coordinate
system and after mapping the whole maze as a graph in standard 'Adjacency-list
representation' method, shortest path and shortest time path was extracted
using Dijkstra's algorithm. In order to find the coordinates of the turning
points and junctions, linear distance between the points are needed, for which
wheel encoder was used. However, due to non-linear movement of robot, the
directly measured distance from the encoder has some error and to remove this
error an idea is built up which ended by deriving equations that gives us
almost exact linear distance between two points from the reading of wheel
encoder of the robot moving in a non-linear path."
"Identification of inertial parameters is fundamental for the implementation
of torque-based control in humanoids. At the same time, good models of friction
and actuator dynamics are critical for the low-level control of joint torques.
We propose a novel method to identify inertial, friction and motor parameters
in a single procedure. The identification exploits the measurements of the PWM
of the DC motors and a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted inside the kinematic
chain. The partial least-square (PLS) method is used to perform the regression.
We identified the inertial, friction and motor parameters of the right arm of
the iCub humanoid robot. We verified that the identified model can accurately
predict the force/torque sensor measurements and the motor voltages. Moreover,
we compared the identified parameters against the CAD parameters, in the
prediction of the force/torque sensor measurements. Finally, we showed that the
estimated model can effectively detect external contacts, comparing it against
a tactile-based contact detection. The presented approach offers some
advantages with respect to other state-of-the-art methods, because of its
completeness (i.e. it identifies inertial, friction and motor parameters) and
simplicity (only one data collection, with no particular requirements)."
"This paper presents a new technique to control highly redundant mechanical
systems, such as humanoid robots. We take inspiration from two approaches.
Prioritized control is a widespread multi-task technique in robotics and
animation: tasks have strict priorities and they are satisfied only as long as
they do not conflict with any higher-priority task. Optimal control instead
formulates an optimization problem whose solution is either a feedback control
policy or a feedforward trajectory of control inputs. We introduce strict
priorities in multi-task optimal control problems, as an alternative to
weighting task errors proportionally to their importance. This ensures the
respect of the specified priorities, while avoiding numerical conditioning
issues. We compared our approach with both prioritized control and optimal
control with tests on a simulated robot with 11 degrees of freedom."
"Legged robots are typically in rigid contact with the environment at multiple
locations, which add a degree of complexity to their control. We present a
method to control the motion and a subset of the contact forces of a
floating-base robot. We derive a new formulation of the lexicographic
optimization problem typically arising in multitask motion/force control
frameworks. The structure of the constraints of the problem (i.e. the dynamics
of the robot) allows us to find a sparse analytical solution. This leads to an
equivalent optimization with reduced computational complexity, comparable to
inverse-dynamics based approaches. At the same time, our method preserves the
flexibility of optimization based control frameworks. Simulations were carried
out to achieve different multi-contact behaviors on a 23-degree-offreedom
humanoid robot, validating the presented approach. A comparison with another
state-of-the-art control technique with similar computational complexity shows
the benefits of our controller, which can eliminate force/torque
discontinuities."
"We deal with the problem of planning collision-free trajectories for robots
operating in a shared space. Given the start and destination position for each
of the robots, the task is to find trajectories for all robots that reach their
destinations with minimum total cost such that the robots will not collide when
following the found trajectories. Our approach starts from individually optimal
trajectory for each robot, which are then penalized for being in collision with
other robots. The penalty is gradually increased and the individual
trajectories are iteratively replanned to account for the increased penalty
until a collision-free solution is found. Using extensive experimental
evaluation, we find that such a penalty method constructs trajectories with
near-optimal cost on the instances where the optimum is known and otherwise
with 4-10 % lower cost than the trajectories generated by prioritized planning
and up to 40 % cheaper than trajectories generated by local collision avoidance
techniques, such as ORCA."
"The aim of this work is to address issues where formal specifications cannot
be realized on a given dynamical system subjected to a changing environment.
Such failures occur whenever the dynamics of the system restrict the robot in
such a way that the environment may prevent the robot from progressing safely
to its goals. We provide a framework that automatically synthesizes revisions
to such specifications that restrict the assumed behaviors of the environment
and the behaviors of the system. We provide a means for explaining such
modifications to the user in a concise, easy-to-understand manner. Integral to
the framework is a new algorithm for synthesizing controllers for reactive
specifications that include a discrete representation of the robot's dynamics.
The new approach is demonstrated with a complex task implemented using a
unicycle model."
"Hierarchical inverse dynamics based on cascades of quadratic programs have
been proposed for the control of legged robots. They have important benefits
but to the best of our knowledge have never been implemented on a torque
controlled humanoid where model inaccuracies, sensor noise and real-time
computation requirements can be problematic. Using a reformulation of existing
algorithms, we propose a simplification of the problem that allows to achieve
real-time control. Momentum-based control is integrated in the task hierarchy
and a LQR design approach is used to compute the desired associated closed-loop
behavior and improve performance. Extensive experiments on various balancing
and tracking tasks show very robust performance in the face of unknown
disturbances, even when the humanoid is standing on one foot. Our results
demonstrate that hierarchical inverse dynamics together with momentum control
can be efficiently used for feedback control under real robot conditions."
"This paper presents a novel decentralized interactive architecture for aerial
and ground mobile robots cooperation. The aerial mobile robot is used to
provide a global coverage during an area inspection, while the ground mobile
robot is used to provide a local coverage of ground features. We include a
human-in-the-loop to provide waypoints for the ground mobile robot to progress
safely in the inspected area. The aerial mobile robot follows continuously the
ground mobile robot in order to always keep it in its coverage view."
"Laser scanners are sensors of widespread use in robotic applications. Under
the Robot Operating System (ROS) the information generated by laser scanners
can be conveyed by either LaserScan messages or in the form of PointClouds.
Many publicly available algorithms (mapping, localization, navigation, etc.)
rely on LaserScan messages, yet a tool for handling multiple lasers, merging
their measurements, or to generate generic LaserScan messages from PointClouds,
is not available. This report describes two tools, in the form of ROS nodes,
which we release as open source under the BSD license, which allow to either
merge multiple single-plane laser scans or to generate virtual laser scans from
a point cloud. A short tutorial, along with the main advantages and limitations
of these tools are presented."
"While grasps must satisfy the grasping stability criteria, good grasps depend
on the specific manipulation scenario: the object, its properties and
functionalities, as well as the task and grasp constraints. In this paper, we
consider such information for robot grasping by leveraging manifolds and
symbolic object parts. Specifically, we introduce a new probabilistic logic
module to first semantically reason about pre-grasp configurations with respect
to the intended tasks. Further, a mapping is learned from part-related visual
features to good grasping points. The probabilistic logic module makes use of
object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that
generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of
probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current
approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to
task-dependent grasping points. We show the benefits of the full probabilistic
logic pipeline experimentally and on a real robot."
"In this paper, we introduce a cerebral cortex inspired architecture for
robots in which we have mapped hierarchical cortical representation of human
brain to logic flow and decision making process. Our work focuses on the two
major features of human cognitive process, viz. the perception action cycle and
its hierarchical organization, and the decision making process. To prove the
effectiveness of our proposed method, we incorporated this architecture in our
robot which we named as Cognitive Insect Robot inspired by Brain Architecture
(CIRBA). We have extended our research to the implementation of this cognitive
architecture of CIRBA in multiple robots and have analyzed the level of
cognition attained by them"
"In this paper, we present an implementation of 3-D reciprocal collision
avoidance on real quadrotor helicopters where each quadrotor senses the
relative position and velocity of other quadrotors using an on-board camera. We
show that using our approach, quadrotors are able to successfully avoid
pairwise collisions in GPS and motion-capture denied environments, without
communication between the quadrotors, and even when human operators
deliberately attempt to induce collisions. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that reciprocal collision avoidance has been successfully implemented on
real robots where each agent independently observes the others using on-board
sensors. We theoretically analyze the response of the collision-avoidance
algorithm to the violated assumptions by the use of real robots. We
quantitatively analyze our experimental results. A particularly striking
observation is that at times the quadrotors exhibit ""reciprocal dance""
behavior, which is also observed when humans move past each other in
constrained environments. This seems to be the result of sensing uncertainty,
which causes both robots involved to have a different belief about the relative
positions and velocities and, as a result, choose the same side on which to
pass."
"Path-velocity decomposition is an intuitive yet powerful approach to address
the complexity of kinodynamic motion planning. The difficult trajectory
planning problem is solved in two separate, simpler, steps: first, find a path
in the configuration space that satisfies the geometric constraints (path
planning), and second, find a time-parameterization of that path satisfying the
kinodynamic constraints. A fundamental requirement is that the path found in
the first step should be time-parameterizable. Most existing works fulfill this
requirement by enforcing quasi-static constraints in the path planning step,
resulting in an important loss in completeness. We propose a method that
enables path-velocity decomposition to discover truly dynamic motions, i.e.
motions that are not quasi-statically executable. At the heart of the proposed
method is a new algorithm -- Admissible Velocity Propagation -- which, given a
path and an interval of reachable velocities at the beginning of that path,
computes exactly and efficiently the interval of all the velocities the system
can reach after traversing the path while respecting the system kinodynamic
constraints. Combining this algorithm with usual sampling-based planners then
gives rise to a family of new trajectory planners that can appropriately handle
kinodynamic constraints while retaining the advantages associated with
path-velocity decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
method on some difficult kinodynamic planning problems, where, in particular,
quasi-static methods are guaranteed to fail."
"In this paper, the optimization-based alignment (OBA) methods are
investigated with main focus on the vector observations construction procedures
for the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). The contributions of this
study are twofold. First the OBA method is extended to be able to estimate the
gyroscopes biases coupled with the attitude based on the construction process
of the existing OBA methods. This extension transforms the initial alignment
into an attitude estimation problem which can be solved using the nonlinear
filtering algorithms. The second contribution is the comprehensive evaluation
of the OBA methods and their extensions with different vector observations
construction procedures in terms of convergent speed and steady-state estimate
using field test data collected from different grades of SINS. This study is
expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate OBA methods for different
grade SINS."
"In this note, we have revisited the previously published paper ""Particle
Filtering for Attitude Estimation Using a Minimal Local-Error Representation"".
In the revisit, we point out that the quaternion particle filtering based on
the local/global representation structure has not made full use of the
advantage of the particle filtering in terms of accuracy and robustness.
Moreover, a normalized quaternion determining procedure based on the minimum
mean-square error approach has been investigated into the quaternion-based
particle filtering to obtain the fiducial quaternion for the transformation
between quaternion and modified Rodrigues parameter. The modification
investigated in this note is expected to make the quaternion particle filtering
based on the local/global representation structure more strict."
"Capacitive technology allows building sensors that are small, compact and
have high sensitivity. For this reason it has been widely adopted in robotics.
In a previous work we presented a compliant skin system based on capacitive
technology consisting of triangular modules interconnected to form a system of
sensors that can be deployed on non-flat surfaces. This solution has been
successfully adopted to cover various humanoid robots. The main limitation of
this and all the approaches based on capacitive technology is that they require
to embed a deformable dielectric layer (usually made using an elastomer)
covered by a conductive layer. This complicates the production process
considerably, introduces hysteresis and limits the durability of the sensors
due to ageing and mechanical stress.
  In this paper we describe a novel solution in which the dielectric is made
using a thin layer of 3D fabric which is glued to conductive and protective
layers using techniques adopted in the clothing industry. As such, the sensor
is easier to produce and has better mechanical properties. Furthermore, the
sensor proposed in this paper embeds transducers for thermal compensation of
the pressure measurements. We report experimental analysis that demonstrates
that the sensor has good properties in terms of sensitivity and resolution.
Remarkably we show that the sensor has very low hysteresis and effectively
allows compensating drifts due to temperature variations."
"The Fifth International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and Models for
Robotic Systems (DSLRob'14) was held in conjunction with the 2014 International
Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots
(SIMPAR 2014), October 2014 in Bergamo, Italy.
  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain
that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Model-driven software development offers a
high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at
the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain."
"Evolutionary Robotics allows robots with limited sensors and processing to
tackle complex tasks by means of sensory-motor coordination. In this paper we
show the first application of the Behaviour Tree framework to a real robotic
platform using the Evolutionary Robotics methodology. This framework is used to
improve the intelligibility of the emergent robotic behaviour as compared to
the traditional Neural Network formulation. As a result, the behaviour is
easier to comprehend and manually adapt when crossing the reality gap from
simulation to reality. This functionality is shown by performing real-world
flight tests with the 20-gram DelFly Explorer flapping wing Micro Air Vehicle
equipped with a 4-gram onboard stereo vision system. The experiments show that
the DelFly can fully autonomously search for and fly through a window with only
its onboard sensors and processing. The success rate of the optimised behaviour
in simulation is 88% and the corresponding real-world performance is 54% after
user adaptation. Although this leaves room for improvement, it is higher than
the 46% success rate from a tuned user-defined controller."
"There are many situations in which it would be beneficial for a robot to have
predictive abilities similar to those of rational humans. Some of these
situations include collaborative robots, robots in adversarial situations, and
for dynamic obstacle avoidance. This paper presents an approach to modeling
behaviors of dynamic agents in order to empower robots with the ability to
predict the agent's actions and identify the behavior the agent is executing in
real time. The method of behavior modeling implemented uses hidden Markov
models (HMMs) to model the unobservable states of the dynamic agents. The
background and theory of the behavior modeling is presented. Experimental
results of realistic simulations of a robot predicting the behaviors and
actions of a dynamic agent in a static environment are presented."
"Accumulation of dust on the surface of solar panels reduces the amount of
radiation reaching it. This leads to loss in generated electric power and
formation of hotspots which would permanently damage the solar panel. This
project aims at developing an autonomous vacuum cleaning method which can be
used on a regular basis to maximize the lifetime and efficiency of a solar
panel. This system is implemented using two subsystems namely a Robotic Vacuum
Cleaner and a Docking Station. The Robotic Vacuum Cleaner uses a two stage
cleaning process to remove the dust from the solar panel. It is designed to
work on inclined and slippery surfaces. A control strategy is formulated to
navigate the robot in the required path using an appropriate feedback
mechanism. The battery voltage of the robot is determined periodically and if
it goes below a threshold, it returns to the docking station and charges itself
automatically using power drawn from the solar panels. The operation of the
robotic vacuum cleaner has been verified and relevant results are presented.
The DC Charging circuit in the docking station is simulated in Proteus
environment and is implemented in hardware. An economical, robust Robotic
Vacuum Cleaner which can clean arrays of Solar panels (with or without
inclination) interlinked by rails and recharge itself automatically at a
docking station is designed and implemented."
"In this paper, we revisit batch state estimation through the lens of Gaussian
process (GP) regression. We consider continuous-discrete estimation problems
wherein a trajectory is viewed as a one-dimensional GP, with time as the
independent variable. Our continuous-time prior can be defined by any
nonlinear, time-varying stochastic differential equation driven by white noise;
this allows the possibility of smoothing our trajectory estimates using a
variety of vehicle dynamics models (e.g., `constant-velocity'). We show that
this class of prior results in an inverse kernel matrix (i.e., covariance
matrix between all pairs of measurement times) that is exactly sparse
(block-tridiagonal) and that this can be exploited to carry out GP regression
(and interpolation) very efficiently. When the prior is based on a linear,
time-varying stochastic differential equation and the measurement model is also
linear, this GP approach is equivalent to classical, discrete-time smoothing
(at the measurement times); when a nonlinearity is present, we iterate over the
whole trajectory to maximize accuracy. We test the approach experimentally on a
simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping problem using a mobile robot
dataset."
"This paper presents a method for path-following for quadcopter trajectories
in real time. Non-Linear Guidance Logic is used to find the intercepts of the
subsequent destination. Trajectory tracking is implemented by formulating the
trajectory of the quadcopter using its jerk, in discrete time, and then solving
a convex optimization problem on each decoupled axis. Based on the maximum
possible thrust and angular rates of the quadcopter, feasibility constraints
for the quadcopter have been derived. In this report we describe the design and
implementation of explicit MPC controllers where the controllers were executed
on a computer using sparse solvers to control the vehicle in hovering flight."
"In this paper we present a workflow to design and control robot manipulation
behavior. To remain independent from particular robot hardware and an explicit
area of application, an embedded domain specific language (eDSL) is used to
describe the particular robot and a controller network that drives the robot.
We make use of a) a component-based software framework, b) model-based
algorithms for motion- and sensor processing representations, c) an abstract
model of the control system, and d) a plan management software, to describe a
sequence of software component networks that generate the desired robot
behavior.
  As first results, we present an eDSL for the description of a robotic system
composed of mechatronic subsystems, and for the creation of a multi-stage
control network."
"This work-in-progress paper presents our work with a domain specific language
(DSL) for tackling the issue of programming robots for small-sized batch
production. We observe that as the complexity of assembly increases so does the
likelihood of errors, and these errors need to be addressed. Nevertheless, it
is essential that programming and setting up the assembly remains fast, allows
quick changeovers, easy adjustments and reconfigurations. In this paper we
present an initial design and implementation of extending an existing DSL for
assembly operations with error specification, error handling and advanced move
commands incorporating error tolerance. The DSL is used as part of a framework
that aims at tackling uncertainties through a probabilistic approach."
"Inference of three-dimensional motion from the fusion of inertial and visual
sensory data has to contend with the preponderance of outliers in the latter.
Robust filtering deals with the joint inference and classification task of
selecting which data fits the model, and estimating its state. We derive the
optimal discriminant and propose several approximations, some used in the
literature, others new. We compare them analytically, by pointing to the
assumptions underlying their approximations, and empirically. We show that the
best performing method improves the performance of state-of-the-art
visual-inertial sensor fusion systems, while retaining the same computational
complexity."
"Sampling-based planning algorithms are the most common probabilistically
complete algorithms and are widely used on many robot platforms. Within this
class of algorithms, many variants have been proposed over the last 20 years,
yet there is still no characterization of which algorithms are well-suited for
which classes of problems. This has motivated us to develop a benchmarking
infrastructure for motion planning algorithms. It consists of three main
components. First, we have created an extensive benchmarking software framework
that is included with the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), a C++ library
that contains implementations of many sampling-based algorithms. Second, we
have defined extensible formats for storing benchmark results. The formats are
fairly straightforward so that other planning libraries could easily produce
compatible output. Finally, we have created an interactive, versatile
visualization tool for compact presentation of collected benchmark data. The
tool and underlying database facilitate the analysis of performance across
benchmark problems and planners."
"Diagrammatic models of feeding choices reveal fundamental robotic behaviors.
Successful choices are reinforced by positive feedback, while unsuccessful ones
by negative feedback. This paper will address robotic feeding by casually
relating consequential behavior subtended by a strong dependence upon survival."
"In this paper the design of a control system for a biped robot is described.
Control is specified for a walk cycle of the robot. The implementation of the
control system was done on Matlab Simulink. In this paper a hierarchical fuzzy
logic controller (HFLC) is proposed to control a planar biped walk. The HFLC
design is bio-inspired from human locomotion system. The proposed method is
applied to control five links planar biped into free area and without
obstacles."
"This paper presents an application with ROS, Aria and RosAria to control a
ModelSim simulated Pioneer 3-DX robot. The navigation applies a simple
autonomous algorithm and a teleoperation control using an Android device
sending the gyroscope generated information."
"This paper proposes a new approach to detecting grasp points on novel objects
presented in clutter. The input to our algorithm is a point cloud and the
geometric parameters of the robot hand. The output is a set of hand
configurations that are expected to be good grasps. Our key idea is to use
knowledge of the geometry of a good grasp to improve detection. First, we use a
geometrically necessary condition to sample a large set of high quality grasp
hypotheses. We were surprised to find that using simple geometric conditions
for detection can result in a relatively high grasp success rate. Second, we
use the notion of an antipodal grasp (a standard characterization of a good two
fingered grasp) to help us classify these grasp hypotheses. In particular, we
generate a large automatically labeled training set that gives us high
classification accuracy. Overall, our method achieves an average grasp success
rate of 88% when grasping novels objects presented in isolation and an average
success rate of 73% when grasping novel objects presented in dense clutter.
This system is available as a ROS package at http://wiki.ros.org/agile_grasp."
"This paper derives a complete analytical solution for the probability
distribution of the configuration of a non-holonomic vehicle that moves in two
spatial dimensions by satisfying the unicycle kinematic constraints and in
presence of Brownian noises. In contrast to previous solutions, the one here
derived holds even in the case of arbitrary linear and angular speed. This
solution is obtained by deriving the analytical expression of any-order moment
of the probability distribution. To the best of our knowledge, an analytical
expression for any-order moment that holds even in the case of arbitrary linear
and angular speed, has never been derived before. To compute these moments, a
direct integration of the Langevin equation is carried out and each moment is
expressed as a multiple integral of the deterministic motion (i.e., the known
motion that would result in absence of noise). For the special case when the
ratio between the linear and angular speed is constant, the multiple integrals
can be easily solved and expressed as the real or the imaginary part of
suitable analytic functions. As an application of the derived analytical
results, the paper investigates the diffusivity of the considered Brownian
motion for constant and for arbitrary time-dependent linear and angular speed."
"Humanoid robots locomote by making and breaking contacts with their
environment. A crucial problem is therefore to find precise criteria for a
given contact to remain stable or to break. For rigid surface contacts, the
most general criterion is the Contact Wrench Condition (CWC). To check whether
a motion satisfies the CWC, existing approaches take into account a large
number of individual contact forces (for instance, one at each vertex of the
support polygon), which is computationally costly and prevents the use of
efficient inverse-dynamics methods. Here we argue that the CWC can be
explicitly computed without reference to individual contact forces, and give
closed-form formulae in the case of rectangular surfaces -- which is of
practical importance. It turns out that these formulae simply and naturally
express three conditions: (i) Coulomb friction on the resultant force, (ii) ZMP
inside the support area, and (iii) bounds on the yaw torque. Conditions (i) and
(ii) are already known, but condition (iii) is, to the best of our knowledge,
novel. It is also of particular interest for biped locomotion, where undesired
foot yaw rotations are a known issue. We also show that our formulae yield
simpler and faster computations than existing approaches for humanoid motions
in single support, and demonstrate their consistency in the OpenHRP simulator."
"In this paper, we develop estimation and control methods for quickly reacting
to collisions between omnidirectional mobile platforms and their environment.
To enable the full-body detection of external forces, we use torque sensors
located in the robot's drivetrain. Using model based techniques we estimate,
with good precision, the location, direction, and magnitude of collision
forces, and we develop an admittance controller that achieves a low effective
mass in reaction to them. For experimental testing, we use a facility
containing a calibrated collision dummy and our holonomic mobile platform. We
subsequently explore collisions with the dummy colliding against a stationary
base and the base colliding against a stationary dummy. Overall, we accomplish
fast reaction times and a reduction of impact forces. A proof of concept
experiment presents various parts of the mobile platform, including the wheels,
colliding safely with humans."
"Autonomous learning of object manipulation skills can enable robots to
acquire rich behavioral repertoires that scale to the variety of objects found
in the real world. However, current motion skill learning methods typically
restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting
its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently
developed policy search method \cite{la-lnnpg-14} and use it to learn a range
of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations,
without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set
of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted
time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single
control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to
run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample
count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire
fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn
robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy
airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto
tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps
onto bottles."
"We consider a system consisting of multiple mobile robots in which the user
can at any time issue relocation tasks ordering one of the robots to move from
its current location to a given destination location. In this paper, we deal
with the problem of finding a trajectory for each such relocation task that
avoids collisions with other robots. The chosen robot plans its trajectory so
as to avoid collision with other robots executing tasks that were issued
earlier. We prove that if all possible destinations of the relocation tasks
satisfy so-called valid infrastructure property, then this mechanism is
guaranteed to always succeed and provide a trajectory for the robot that
reaches the destination without colliding with any other robot. The
time-complexity of the approach on a fixed space-time discretization is only
quadratic in the number of robots. We demonstrate the applicability of the
presented method on several real-world maps and compare its performance against
a popular reactive approach that attempts to solve the collisions locally.
Besides being dead-lock free, the presented approach generates trajectories
that are significantly faster (up to 48% improvement) than the trajectories
resulting from local collision avoidance."
"Rigid bodies, plastic impact, persistent contact, Coulomb friction, and
massless limbs are ubiquitous simplifications introduced to reduce the
complexity of mechanics models despite the obvious physical inaccuracies that
each incurs individually. In concert, it is well known that the interaction of
such idealized approximations can lead to conflicting and even paradoxical
results. As robotics modeling moves from the consideration of isolated
behaviors to the analysis of tasks requiring their composition, a
mathematically tractable framework for building models that combine these
simple approximations yet achieve reliable results is overdue. In this paper we
present a formal hybrid dynamical system model that introduces suitably
restricted compositions of these familiar abstractions with the guarantee of
consistency analogous to global existence and uniqueness in classical dynamical
systems. The hybrid system developed here provides a discontinuous but
self-consistent approximation to the continuous (though possibly very stiff and
fast) dynamics of a physical robot undergoing intermittent impacts. The
modeling choices sacrifice some quantitative numerical efficiencies while
maintaining qualitatively correct and analytically tractable results with
consistency guarantees promoting their use in formal reasoning about mechanism,
feedback control, and behavior design in robots that make and break contact
with their environment."
"A reactive obstacle avoidance method for mobile manipulators is presented.
The objectives of the developed algorithm are twofold. The first one is to find
a trajectory in the configuration space of a mobile manipulator so as to follow
a given trajectory in the task space. The second objective consists in locally
adjusting the trajectory in the configuration space in order to avoid
collisions with potentially moving obstacles and self-collisions in
unstructured and dynamic environments. The perception is exclusively based on a
set of proximity sensors distributed on the robot mechanical structure and
visual information are not required. Thanks to the adoption of this kind of
proximity distributed perception, the approach does not require a 3D model of
the robot and allows the real-time collision avoidance without the need of a
sensorized environment. To achieve the features cited above, a behaviour-based
technique known as Null-Space-Based (NSB) approach has been adopted with some
modifications.On one hand, the concept of a total pseudo-energy based on the
information from the distributed sensors has been introduced. On the other
hand, a method to combine different tasks has been proposed to guarantee the
smoothness of the realtime trajectory adjustments. Another significant feature
of the method is the strict coordination between the base and the arm
exploiting the redundant degrees of freedom, that is a relevant topic in mobile
manipulation."
"In this paper we will explore different available methodologies to
automatically design controllers for tasks that spans many level of
abstraction, where the gap between primitive behaviours and the task definition
is high. A good understanding of your evolutionary setup is needed to choose
the correct strategy with which to tackle complex tasks thus we'll first review
the most used types of each element composing an evolutionary setup
(controllers, objective functions, ect.) then we'll move the focus on the
bootstrapping problem and on the different strategies used to overcome it."
"Multi-robot teams offer possibilities of improved performance and fault
tolerance, compared to single robot solutions. In this paper, we show how to
realize those possibilities when starting from a single robot system controlled
by a Behavior Tree (BT). By extending the single robot BT to a multi-robot BT,
we are able to combine the fault tolerant properties of the BT, in terms of
built-in fallbacks, with the fault tolerance inherent in multi-robot
approaches, in terms of a faulty robot being replaced by another one.
Furthermore, we improve performance by identifying and taking advantage of the
opportunities of parallel task execution, that are present in the single robot
BT. Analyzing the proposed approach, we present results regarding how mission
performance is affected by minor faults (a robot losing one capability) as well
as major faults (a robot losing all its capabilities). Finally, a detailed
example is provided to illustrate the approach."
"In this paper we present the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Object and Model set,
intended to be used to facilitate benchmarking in robotic manipulation,
prosthetic design and rehabilitation research. The objects in the set are
designed to cover a wide range of aspects of the manipulation problem; it
includes objects of daily life with different shapes, sizes, textures, weight
and rigidity, as well as some widely used manipulation tests. The associated
database provides high-resolution RGBD scans, physical properties, and
geometric models of the objects for easy incorporation into manipulation and
planning software platforms. In addition to describing the objects and models
in the set along with how they were chosen and derived, we provide a framework
and a number of example task protocols, laying out how the set can be used to
quantitatively evaluate a range of manipulation approaches including planning,
learning, mechanical design, control, and many others. A comprehensive
literature survey on existing benchmarks and object datasets is also presented
and their scope and limitations are discussed. The set will be freely
distributed to research groups worldwide at a series of tutorials at robotics
conferences, and will be otherwise available at a reasonable purchase cost. It
is our hope that the ready availability of this set along with the ground laid
in terms of protocol templates will enable the community of manipulation
researchers to more easily compare approaches as well as continually evolve
benchmarking tests as the field matures."
"The NUbots are an interdisciplinary RoboCup team from The University of
Newcastle, Australia. The team has a history of strong contributions in the
areas of machine learning and computer vision. The NUbots have participated in
RoboCup leagues since 2002, placing first several times in the past. In 2014
the NUbots also partnered with the University of Newcastle Mechatronics
Laboratory to participate in the RobotX Marine Robotics Challenge, which
resulted in several new ideas and improvements to the NUbots vision system for
RoboCup. This paper summarizes the history of the NUbots team, describes the

"We present an adaptive sampling approach to 3D reconstruction of the welding
joint using the point cloud that is generated by a laser sensor. We start with
a randomized strategy to approximate the surface of the volume of interest
through selection of a number of pivotal candidates. Furthermore, we introduce
three proposal distributions over the neighborhood of each of these pivots to
adaptively sample from their neighbors to refine the original randomized
approximation to incrementally reconstruct this welding space. We prevent our
algorithm from being trapped in a neighborhood via permanently labeling the
visited samples. In addition, we accumulate the accepted candidates along with
their selected neighbors in a queue structure to allow every selected sample to
contribute to the evolution of the reconstructed welding space as the algorithm
progresses. We analyze the performance of our adaptive sampling algorithm in
contrast to the random sampling, with and without replacement, to show a
significant improvement in total number of samples that are drawn to identify
the region of interest, thereby expanding upon neighboring samples to extract
the entire region in a fewer iterations and a shorter computation time."
"This report outlines the procedure and results of an experiment to
characterize a bearing-only sensor for use with PHD filter. The resulting
detection, measurement, and clutter models are used for hardware and simulated
experiments with a team of mobile robots autonomously seeking an unknown number
of objects of interest in an office environment."
"We have built a 12DOF, passive-compliant legged, tailed biped actuated by
four brushless DC motors. We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied
modes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion
tasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping,
and more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated
body, requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our
interest in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a
relatively few base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of
available choices. Here we report on the development of one important example
of such a behavioral programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal
sagittal plane hopping gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF
base controllers.
  For this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is
fastened to a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform's
locomotion is powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in
flight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape
in flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance.
The motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four
simple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in
isolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these
abstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific
component of the locomotion task at hand. We present a partial proof of
correctness for this parallel composition of template reference systems along
with data from the physical platform suggesting these templates are anchored as
evidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic motions with a suitably
transformed image of traces from the physical platform."
"We present an algorithm which combines recent advances in model based path
integral control with machine learning approaches to learning forward dynamics
models. We take advantage of the parallel computing power of a GPU to quickly
take a massive number of samples from a learned probabilistic dynamics model,
which we use to approximate the path integral form of the optimal control. The
resulting algorithm runs in a receding-horizon fashion in realtime, and is
subject to no restrictive assumptions about costs, constraints, or dynamics. A
simple change to the path integral control formulation allows the algorithm to
take model uncertainty into account during planning, and we demonstrate its
performance on a quadrotor navigation task. In addition to this novel
adaptation of path integral control, this is the first time that a
receding-horizon implementation of iterative path integral control has been run
on a real system."
"This work proposes a control law for a manipulator with the aim of realizing
desired time-varying motion-force profiles in the presence of a stiff
environment. In many cases, the interaction with the environment affects only
one degree of freedom of the end-effector of the manipulator. Therefore, the
focus is on this contact degree of freedom, and a switching position-force
controller is proposed to perform the hybrid position-force tracking task.
Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee input-to-state stability of
the switching closed-loop system with respect to perturbations related to the
time-varying desired motion-force profile. The switching occurs when the
manipulator makes or breaks contact with the environment. The analysis shows
that to guarantee closed-loop stability while tracking arbitrary time-varying
motion-force profiles, the controller should implement a considerable (and
often unrealistic) amount of damping, resulting in inferior tracking
performance. Therefore, we propose to redesign the manipulator with a compliant
wrist. Guidelines are provided for the design of the compliant wrist while
employing the designed switching control strategy, such that stable tracking of
a motion-force reference trajectory can be achieved and bouncing of the
manipulator while making contact with the stiff environment can be avoided.
Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of
the approach."
"The idea of a two wheel self-balancing robot has become very popular among
control system researchers worldwide over the last decade. This paper presents
a one variant of the implementation of the self-balancing robot using the VEX
Robotics Kit."
"Natural language offers an intuitive and flexible means for humans to
communicate with the robots that we will increasingly work alongside in our
homes and workplaces. Recent advancements have given rise to robots that are
able to interpret natural language manipulation and navigation commands, but
these methods require a prior map of the robot's environment. In this paper, we
propose a novel learning framework that enables robots to successfully follow
natural language route directions without any previous knowledge of the
environment. The algorithm utilizes spatial and semantic information that the
human conveys through the command to learn a distribution over the metric and
semantic properties of spatially extended environments. Our method uses this
distribution in place of the latent world model and interprets the natural
language instruction as a distribution over the intended behavior. A novel
belief space planner reasons directly over the map and behavior distributions
to solve for a policy using imitation learning. We evaluate our framework on a
voice-commandable wheelchair. The results demonstrate that by learning and
performing inference over a latent environment model, the algorithm is able to
successfully follow natural language route directions within novel, extended
environments."
"Robot teleoperation systems face a common set of challenges including
latency, low-dimensional user commands, and asymmetric control inputs. User
control with Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exacerbates these problems
through especially noisy and erratic low-dimensional motion commands due to the
difficulty in decoding neural activity. We introduce a general framework to
address these challenges through a combination of computer vision, user intent
inference, and arbitration between the human input and autonomous control
schemes. Adjustable levels of assistance allow the system to balance the
operator's capabilities and feelings of comfort and control while compensating
for a task's difficulty. We present experimental results demonstrating
significant performance improvement using the shared-control assistance
framework on adapted rehabilitation benchmarks with two subjects implanted with
intracortical brain-computer interfaces controlling a seven degree-of-freedom
robotic manipulator as a prosthetic. Our results further indicate that shared
assistance mitigates perceived user difficulty and even enables successful
performance on previously infeasible tasks. We showcase the extensibility of
our architecture with applications to quality-of-life tasks such as opening a
door, pouring liquids from containers, and manipulation with novel objects in
densely cluttered environments."
"For robots to be able to manipulate in unknown and unstructured environments
the robot should be capable of operating under partial observability of the
environment. Object occlusions and unmodeled environments are some of the
factors that result in partial observability. A common scenario where this is
encountered is manipulation in clutter. In the case that the robot needs to
locate an object of interest and manipulate it, it needs to perform a series of
decluttering actions to accurately detect the object of interest. To perform
such a series of actions, the robot also needs to account for the dynamics of
objects in the environment and how they react to contact. This is a non trivial
problem since one needs to reason not only about robot-object interactions but
also object-object interactions in the presence of contact. In the example
scenario of manipulation in clutter, the state vector would have to account for
the pose of the object of interest and the structure of the surrounding
environment. The process model would have to account for all the aforementioned
robot-object, object-object interactions. The complexity of the process model
grows exponentially as the number of objects in the scene increases. This is
commonly the case in unstructured environments. Hence it is not reasonable to
attempt to model all object-object and robot-object interactions explicitly.
Under this setting we propose a hypothesis based action selection algorithm
where we construct a hypothesis set of the possible poses of an object of
interest given the current evidence in the scene and select actions based on
our current set of hypothesis. This hypothesis set tends to represent the
belief about the structure of the environment and the number of poses the
object of interest can take. The agent's only stopping criterion is when the
uncertainty regarding the pose of the object is fully resolved."
"Repetitive tasks in industrial works may contribute to health problems among
operators, such as musculo-skeletal disorders, in part due to insufficient
control of muscle fatigue. In this paper, a predictive model of fatigue is
proposed for repetitive push/pull operations. Assumptions generally accepted in
the literature are first explicitly set in this framework. Then, an earlier
static fatigue model is recalled and extended to quasi-static situations.
Specifically, the maximal torque that can be generated at a joint is not
considered as constant, but instead varies over time accordingly to the
operator's changing posture. The fatigue model is implemented with this new
consideration and evaluated in a simulation of push/pull operation. Reference
to this paper should be made as follows: Sakka, S., Chablat, D., Ma, R. and
Bennis, F. (2015) 'Predictive model of the human muscle fatigue: application to
repetitive push-pull tasks with light external load', Int."
"Exploiting interaction with the environment is a promising and powerful way
to enhance stability of humanoid robots and robustness while executing
locomotion and manipulation tasks. Recently some works have started to show
advances in this direction considering humanoid locomotion with multi-contacts,
but to be able to fully develop such abilities in a more autonomous way, we
need to first understand and classify the variety of possible poses a humanoid
robot can achieve to balance. To this end, we propose the adaptation of a
successful idea widely used in the field of robot grasping to the field of
humanoid balance with multi-contacts: a whole-body pose taxonomy classifying
the set of whole-body robot configurations that use the environment to enhance
stability. We have revised criteria of classification used to develop grasping
taxonomies, focusing on structuring and simplifying the large number of
possible poses the human body can adopt. We propose a taxonomy with 46 poses,
containing three main categories, considering number and type of supports as
well as possible transitions between poses. The taxonomy induces a
classification of motion primitives based on the pose used for support, and a
set of rules to store and generate new motions. We present preliminary results
that apply known segmentation techniques to motion data from the KIT whole-body
motion database. Using motion capture data with multi-contacts, we can identify
support poses providing a segmentation that can distinguish between locomotion
and manipulation parts of an action."
"In shared autonomy, user input and robot autonomy are combined to control a
robot to achieve a goal. Often, the robot does not know a priori which goal the
user wants to achieve, and must both predict the user's intended goal, and
assist in achieving that goal. We formulate the problem of shared autonomy as a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with uncertainty over the user's
goal. We utilize maximum entropy inverse optimal control to estimate a
distribution over the user's goal based on the history of inputs. Ideally, the
robot assists the user by solving for an action which minimizes the expected
cost-to-go for the (unknown) goal. As solving the POMDP to select the optimal
action is intractable, we use hindsight optimization to approximate the
solution. In a user study, we compare our method to a standard
predict-then-blend approach. We find that our method enables users to
accomplish tasks more quickly while utilizing less input. However, when asked
to rate each system, users were mixed in their assessment, citing a tradeoff
between maintaining control authority and accomplishing tasks quickly."
"This paper describes a novel method for allowing an autonomous ground vehicle
to predict the intent of other agents in an urban environment. This method,
termed the cognitive driving framework, models both the intent and the
potentially false beliefs of an obstacle vehicle. By modeling the relationships
between these variables as a dynamic Bayesian network, filtering can be
performed to calculate the intent of the obstacle vehicle as well as its belief
about the environment. This joint knowledge can be exploited to plan safer and
more efficient trajectories when navigating in an urban environment. Simulation
results are presented that demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to
calculate the intent of obstacle vehicles as an autonomous vehicle navigates a
road intersection such that preventative maneuvers can be taken to avoid
imminent collisions."
"This article presents computationally efficient algorithms for modeling two
special cases of rigid contact---contact with only viscous friction and contact
without slip---that have particularly useful applications in robotic locomotion
and grasping. Modeling rigid contact with Coulomb friction generally exhibits
$O(n^3)$ expected time complexity in the number of contact points and
$2^{O(n)}$ worst-case complexity. The special cases we consider exhibit $O(m^3
+ m^2n)$ time complexity ($m$ is the number of independent coordinates in the
multi rigid body system) in the expected case and polynomial complexity in the
worst case; thus, asymptotic complexity is no longer driven by number of
contact points (which is conceivably limitless) but instead is more dependent
on the number of bodies in the system (which is often fixed). These special
cases also require considerably fewer constrained nonlinear optimization
variables thus yielding substantial improvements in running time. Finally,
these special cases also afford one other advantage: the nonlinear optimization
problems are numerically easier to solve."
"This paper presents a numerical method to conceive and design the kinematic
model of an anthropomorphic robotic hand used for gesturing and grasping. In
literature, there are few numerical methods for the finger placement of
human-inspired robotic hands. In particular, there are no numerical methods,
for the thumb placement, that aim to improve the hand dexterity and grasping
capabilities by keeping the hand design close to the human one. While existing
models are usually the result of successive parameter adjustments, the proposed
method determines the fingers placements by mean of empirical tests. Moreover,
a surgery test and the workspace analysis of the whole hand are used to find
the best thumb position and orientation according to the hand kinematics and
structure. The result is validated through simulation where it is checked that
the hand looks well balanced and that it meets our constraints and needs. The
presented method provides a numerical tool which allows the easy computation of
finger and thumb geometries and base placements for a human-like dexterous
robotic hand."
"Recent work on simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping (STEAM) for
mobile robots has found success by representing the trajectory as a Gaussian
process. Gaussian processes can represent a continuous-time trajectory,
elegantly handle asynchronous and sparse measurements, and allow the robot to
query the trajectory to recover its estimated position at any time of interest.
A major drawback of this approach is that STEAM is formulated as a batch
estimation problem. In this paper we provide the critical extensions necessary
to transform the existing batch algorithm into an extremely efficient
incremental algorithm. In particular, we are able to vastly speed up the
solution time through efficient variable reordering and incremental sparse
updates, which we believe will greatly increase the practicality of Gaussian
process methods for robot mapping and localization. Finally, we demonstrate the
approach and its advantages on both synthetic and real datasets."
"Haptic shared control is expected to achieve a smooth collaboration between
humans and automated systems, because haptics facilitate mutual communication.
A methodology for sharing a given task is important to achieve effective shared
control. Therefore, the appropriate cooperative relationship between a human
operator and automated system should be considered. This paper proposes a
methodology to evaluate the cooperative status between the operator and the
automated system in the haptic shared control of a steering operation using a
pseudo-power pair of torque from each agent and the vehicle lateral velocity as
each agent's contribution to vehicle motion. This method allows us to estimate
cooperative status based on two axes: the initiative holder and the intent
consistency between the two agents. A control method for a lane-keeping assist
system (LKAS) that enables drivers to change lanes smoothly is proposed based
on the estimated cooperative status. A gain-tuning control method based on the
estimated cooperative status is proposed to decrease the assistance system's
pseudo-power when intent inconsistency occurs. A method for switching the
followed lane to match the driver's and assistance system's intentions is also
proposed. A user study using a driving simulator is conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methods facilitate smooth driver-initiated lane changes without
significantly affecting the driver's torque or steering wheel angle while
significantly improve lane-keeping performance."
"We consider a three-dimensional problem of steering a nonholonomic vehicle to
seek an unknown source of a spatially distributed signal field without any
position measurement. In the literature, there exists an extremum seeking-based
strategy under a constant forward velocity and tunable pitch and yaw
velocities. Obviously, the vehicle with a constant forward velocity may exhibit
certain overshoots in the seeking process and can not slow down even it
approaches the source. To resolve this undesired behavior, this paper proposes
a regulation strategy for the forward velocity along with the pitch and yaw
velocities. Under such a strategy, the vehicle slows down near the source and
stays within a small area as if it comes to a full stop, and controllers for
angular velocities become succinct. We prove the local exponential convergence
via the averaging technique. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated
with simulations."
"We study the problem of motion-planning for free-flying multi-link robots and
develop a sampling-based algorithm that is specifically tailored for the task.
Our work is based on the simple observation that the set of configurations for
which the robot is self-collision free is independent of the obstacles or of
the exact placement of the robot. This allows to eliminate the need to perform
costly self-collision checks online when solving motion-planning problems,
assuming some offline preprocessing. In particular, given a specific robot type
our algorithm precomputes a tiling roadmap, which efficiently and implicitly
encodes the self-collision free (sub-)space over the entire configuration
space, where the latter can be infinite for that matter. To answer any query,
in any given scenario, we traverse the tiling roadmap while only testing for
collisions with obstacles. Our algorithm suggests more flexibility than the
prevailing paradigm in which a precomputed roadmap depends both on the robot
and on the scenario at hand. We show through various simulations the
effectiveness of this approach on open and closed-chain multi-link robots,
where in some settings our algorithm is more than fifty times faster than the
state-of-the-art."
"The problem of optimal feedback planning among obstacles in d-dimensional
configuration spaces is considered. We present a sampling-based, asymptotically
optimal feedback planning method. Our method combines an incremental
construction of the Delaunay triangulation, volumetric collision-detection
module, and a modified Fast Marching Method to compute a converging sequence of
feedback functions. The convergence and asymptotic runtime are proven
theoretically and investigated during numerical experiments, in which the
proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art asymptotically optimal
path planners. The results show that our method is competitive with the
previous algorithms. Unlike the shortest trajectory computed by many path
planning algorithms, the resulting feedback functions can be used directly for
robot navigation in our case. Finally, we present a straightforward extension
of our method that handles dynamic environments where obstacles can appear,
disappear, or move."
"The Gaussian Filter (GF) is one of the most widely used filtering algorithms;
instances are the Extended Kalman Filter, the Unscented Kalman Filter and the
Divided Difference Filter. GFs represent the belief of the current state by a
Gaussian with the mean being an affine function of the measurement. We show
that this representation can be too restrictive to accurately capture the
dependences in systems with nonlinear observation models, and we investigate
how the GF can be generalized to alleviate this problem. To this end, we view
the GF from a variational-inference perspective. We analyse how restrictions on
the form of the belief can be relaxed while maintaining simplicity and
efficiency. This analysis provides a basis for generalizations of the GF. We
propose one such generalization which coincides with a GF using a virtual
measurement, obtained by applying a nonlinear function to the actual
measurement. Numerical experiments show that the proposed Feature Gaussian
Filter (FGF) can have a substantial performance advantage over the standard GF
for systems with nonlinear observation models."
"This article presents a novel approach, named MCMP (Monte Carlo Motion
Planning), to the problem of motion planning under uncertainty, i.e., to the
problem of computing a low-cost path that fulfills probabilistic collision
avoidance constraints. MCMP estimates the collision probability (CP) of a given
path by sampling via Monte Carlo the execution of a reference tracking
controller (in this paper we consider LQG). The key algorithmic contribution of
this paper is the design of statistical variance-reduction techniques, namely
control variates and importance sampling, to make such a sampling procedure
amenable to real-time implementation. MCMP applies this CP estimation procedure
to motion planning by iteratively (i) computing an (approximately) optimal path
for the deterministic version of the problem (here, using the FMT* algorithm),
(ii) computing the CP of this path, and (iii) inflating or deflating the
obstacles by a common factor depending on whether the CP is higher or lower
than a target value. The advantages of MCMP are threefold: (i) asymptotic
correctness of CP estimation, as opposed to most current approximations, which,
as shown in this paper, can be off by large multiples and hinder the
computation of feasible plans; (ii) speed and parallelizability, and (iii)
generality, i.e., the approach is applicable to virtually any planning problem
provided that a path tracking controller and a notion of distance to obstacles
in the configuration space are available. Numerical results illustrate the
correctness (in terms of feasibility), efficiency (in terms of path cost), and
computational speed of MCMP."
"Probabilistic sampling-based algorithms, such as the probabilistic roadmap
(PRM) and the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms, represent one of
the most successful approaches to robotic motion planning, due to their strong
theoretical properties (in terms of probabilistic completeness or even
asymptotic optimality) and remarkable practical performance. Such algorithms
are probabilistic in that they compute a path by connecting independently and
identically distributed random points in the configuration space. Their
randomization aspect, however, makes several tasks challenging, including
certification for safety-critical applications and use of offline computation
to improve real-time execution. Hence, an important open question is whether
similar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be
obtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random sampling sequences.
The objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question.
Specifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning
parameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is
deterministically asymptotically optimal. Second, we characterize the
convergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very
explicitly upper-bounded in terms of the l2-dispersion of the sampling sequence
and the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal
version of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close
to O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the
sequence. This is in stark contrast to the O(n logn) complexity results for
existing asymptotically-optimal probabilistic planners. Finally, through
numerical experiments, we show that planning with deterministic low-dispersion
sampling generally provides superior performance in terms of path cost and
success rate."
"We present a centralized algorithmic framework for solving multi-robot path
planning problems in general, two-dimensional, continuous environments while
minimizing globally the task completion time. The framework obtains high levels
of effectiveness through the composition of an optimal discretization of the
continuous environment and the subsequent fast, near-optimal resolution of the
resulting discrete planning problem. This principled approach achieves orders
of magnitudes better performance with respect to both speed and the supported
robot density. For a wide variety of environments, our method is shown to
compute globally near-optimal solutions for fifty robots in seconds with robots
packed close to each other. In the extreme, the method can consistently solve
problems with hundreds of robots that occupy over 30% of the free space."
"We address the problem of tracking the 6-DoF pose of an object while it is
being manipulated by a human or a robot. We use a dynamic Bayesian network to
perform inference and compute a posterior distribution over the current object
pose. Depending on whether a robot or a human manipulates the object, we employ
a process model with or without knowledge of control inputs. Observations are
obtained from a range camera. As opposed to previous object tracking methods,
we explicitly model self-occlusions and occlusions from the environment, e.g,
the human or robotic hand. This leads to a strongly non-linear observation
model and additional dependencies in the Bayesian network. We employ a
Rao-Blackwellised particle filter to compute an estimate of the object pose at
every time step. In a set of experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our
method to accurately and robustly track the object pose in real-time while it
is being manipulated by a human or a robot."
"Parametric filters, such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented
Kalman Filter, typically scale well with the dimensionality of the problem, but
they are known to fail if the posterior state distribution cannot be closely
approximated by a density of the assumed parametric form. For nonparametric
filters, such as the Particle Filter, the converse holds. Such methods are able
to approximate any posterior, but the computational requirements scale
exponentially with the number of dimensions of the state space. In this paper,
we present the Coordinate Particle Filter which alleviates this problem. We
propose to compute the particle weights recursively, dimension by dimension.
This allows us to explore one dimension at a time, and resample after each
dimension if necessary. Experimental results on simulated as well as real data
confirm that the proposed method has a substantial performance advantage over
the Particle Filter in high-dimensional systems where not all dimensions are
highly correlated. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method for the
problem of multi-object and robotic manipulator tracking."
"The following paper reviews recent developments in the field of optimization
of space robotics. The extent of focus of this paper is on the perception
(robotic sense of analyzing surroundings) in space robots in the exploration of
extra-terrestrial planets. Robots play a crucial role in exploring
extra-terrestrial and planetary bodies. Their advantages are far from being
counted on finger tips. With the advent of autonomous robots in the field of
robotics, the role for space exploration has further hustled up. Optimization
of such autonomous robots has turned into a necessity of the hour. Optimized
robots tend to have a superior role in space exploration. With so many
considerations to monitor, an optimized solution will nevertheless help a
planetary rover perform better under tight circumstances. Keeping in view the
above mentioned area, the paper describes recent developments in the
optimization of autonomous extra-terrestrial rovers."
"We present a number of powerful local mechanisms for maintaining a dynamic
swarm of robots with limited capabilities and information, in the presence of
external forces and permanent node failures. We propose a set of local
continuous algorithms that together produce a generalization of a Euclidean
Steiner tree. At any stage, the resulting overall shape achieves a good
compromise between local thickness, global connectivity, and flexibility to
further continuous motion of the terminals. The resulting swarm behavior scales
well, is robust against node failures, and performs close to the best known
approximation bound for a corresponding centralized static optimization
problem."
"We consider the problem of organizing a scattered group of $n$ robots in
two-dimensional space, with geometric maximum distance $D$ between robots. The
communication graph of the swarm is connected, but there is no central
authority for organizing it. We want to arrange them into a sorted and
equally-spaced array between the robots with lowest and highest label, while
maintaining a connected communication network.
  In this paper, we describe a distributed method to accomplish these goals,
without using central control, while also keeping time, travel distance and
communication cost at a minimum. We proceed in a number of stages (leader
election, initial path construction, subtree contraction, geometric
straightening, and distributed sorting), none of which requires a central
authority, but still accomplishes best possible parallelization. The overall
arraying is performed in $O(n)$ time, $O(n^2)$ individual messages, and $O(nD)$
travel distance. Implementation of the sorting and navigation use communication
messages of fixed size, and are a practical solution for large populations of
low-cost robots."
"Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) is the problem of estimating a set of poses
from pairwise relative measurements. PGO is a nonconvex problem, and currently
no known technique can guarantee the computation of an optimal solution. In
this paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal
solution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases.
Our first contribution is to frame the PGO problem in the complex domain. This
makes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature
on unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results
about the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second
contribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex
domain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of
eigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution
of the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then
(i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal PGO problem has a unique solution,
and (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the
penalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit
the dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal
solution for PGO when the penalized pose graph matrix satisfies the Single Zero
Eigenvalue Property (SZEP). We also propose a variant that deals with the case
in which the SZEP is not satisfied. The fourth contribution is a numerical
analysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100% of
the tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized
pose graph matrix does satisfy the SZEP, hence our approach allows computing
the global optimal solution. Finally, we report simple counterexamples in which
the duality gap is nonzero, and discuss open problems."
"This paper presents an equivalence between feasible kinodynamic planning and
optimal kinodynamic planning, in that any optimal planning problem can be
transformed into a series of feasible planning problems in a state-cost space
whose solutions approach the optimum. This transformation gives rise to a
meta-algorithm that produces an asymptotically optimal planner, given any
feasible kinodynamic planner as a subroutine. The meta-algorithm is proven to
be asymptotically optimal, and a formula is derived relating expected running
time and solution suboptimality. It is directly applicable to a wide range of
optimal planning problems because it does not resort to the use of steering
functions or numerical boundary-value problem solvers. On a set of benchmark
problems, it is demonstrated to perform, using the EST and RRT algorithms as
subroutines, at a superior or comparable level to related planners."
"Workspace and joint space analysis are essential steps in describing the task
and designing the control loop of the robot, respectively. This paper presents
the descriptive analysis of a family of delta-like parallel robots by using
algebraic tools to induce an estimation about the complexity in representing
the singularities in the workspace and the joint space. A Gr{\""o}bner based
elimination is used to compute the singularities of the manipulator and a
Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition algorithm is used to study the workspace
and the joint space. From these algebraic objects, we propose some certified
three dimensional plotting describing the the shape of workspace and of the
joint space which will help the engineers or researchers to decide the most
suited configuration of the manipulator they should use for a given task. Also,
the different parameters associated with the complexity of the serial and
parallel singularities are tabulated, which further enhance the selection of
the different configuration of the manipulator by comparing the complexity of
the singularity equations."
"This paper presents a novel decentralized control strategy for a multi-robot
system that enables parallel multi-target exploration while ensuring a
time-varying connected topology in cluttered 3D environments. Flexible
continuous connectivity is guaranteed by building upon a recent connectivity
maintenance method, in which limited range, line-of-sight visibility, and
collision avoidance are taken into account at the same time. Completeness of
the decentralized multi-target exploration algorithm is guaranteed by
dynamically assigning the robots with different motion behaviors during the
exploration task. One major group is subject to a suitable downscaling of the
main traveling force based on the traveling efficiency of the current leader
and the direction alignment between traveling and connectivity force. This
supports the leader in always reaching its current target and, on a larger time
horizon, that the whole team realizes the overall task in finite time.
Extensive Monte~Carlo simulations with a group of several quadrotor UAVs show
the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed method and experiments
validate its practicability."
"The emergent global behaviours of robotic swarms are important to achieve
their navigation task goals. These emergent behaviours can be verified to
assess their correctness, through techniques like model checking. Model
checking exhaustively explores all possible behaviours, based on a discrete
model of the system, such as a swarm in a grid. A common problem in model
checking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model
are numerous. We propose a novel implementation of symmetry reduction, in the
form of encoding navigation algorithms relatively with respect to a reference,
based on the symmetrical properties of swarms in grids. We applied the relative
encoding to a swarm navigation algorithm, Alpha, modelled for the NuSMV model
checker. A comparison of the state-space and verification results with an
absolute (or global) and a relative encoding of the Alpha algorithm highlights
the advantages of our approach, allowing model checking larger grid sizes and
number of robots, and consequently, verifying more complex emergent behaviours.
For example, a property was verified for a grid with 3 robots and a maximum
allowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased
to 16x16 using a relative encoding. Also, the time to verify a property for a
swarm of 3 robots in a 6x6 grid was reduced from almost 10 hours to only 7
minutes. Our approach is transferable to other swarm navigation algorithms."
"We present a method to solve planning problems involving sequential decision
making in unpredictable environments while accomplishing a high level task
specification expressed using the formalism of linear temporal logic. Our
method improves the state of the art by introducing a pruning step that
preserves correctness while significantly reducing the time needed to compute
an optimal policy. Our theoretical contribution is coupled with simulations
substantiating the value of the proposed method."
"Trajectory planning is a critical step while programming the parallel
manipulators in a robotic cell. The main problem arises when there exists a
singular configuration between the two poses of the end-effectors while
discretizing the path with a classical approach. This paper presents an
algebraic method to check the feasibility of any given trajectories in the
workspace. The solutions of the polynomial equations associated with the
tra-jectories are projected in the joint space using Gr{\""o}bner based
elimination methods and the remaining equations are expressed in a parametric
form where the articular variables are functions of time t unlike any numerical
or discretization method. These formal computations allow to write the Jacobian
of the manip-ulator as a function of time and to check if its determinant can
vanish between two poses. Another benefit of this approach is to use a largest
workspace with a more complex shape than a cube, cylinder or sphere. For the
Orthoglide, a three degrees of freedom parallel robot, three different
trajectories are used to illustrate this method."
"The subject of this paper is about the kinematic analysis and the trajectory
planning of the Orthoglide 5-axis. The Orthoglide 5-axis a five degrees of
freedom parallel kinematic machine developed at IRCCyN and is made up of a
hybrid architecture, namely, a three degrees of freedom translational parallel
manip-ulator mounted in series with a two degrees of freedom parallel spherical
wrist. The simpler the kinematic modeling of the Or-thoglide 5-axis, the higher
the maximum frequency of its control loop. Indeed, the control loop of a
parallel kinematic machine should be computed with a high frequency, i.e.,
higher than 1.5 MHz, in order the manipulator to be able to reach high speed
motions with a good accuracy. Accordingly, the direct and inverse kinematic
models of the Orthoglide 5-axis, its inverse kine-matic Jacobian matrix and the
first derivative of the latter with respect to time are expressed in this
paper. It appears that the kinematic model of the manipulator under study can
be written in a quadratic form due to the hybrid architecture of the Orthoglide
5-axis. As illustrative examples, the profiles of the actuated joint angles
(lengths), velocities and accelerations that are used in the control loop of
the robot are traced for two test trajectories."
"We define the nervous system of a robot as the processing unit responsible
for controlling the robot body, together with the links between the processing
unit and the sensorimotor hardware of the robot - i.e., the equivalent of the
central nervous system in biological organisms. We present autonomous robots
that can merge their nervous systems when they physically connect to each
other, creating a ""virtual nervous system"" (VNS). We show that robots with a
VNS have capabilities beyond those found in any existing robotic system or
biological organism: they can merge into larger bodies with a single brain
(i.e., processing unit), split into separate bodies with independent brains,
and temporarily acquire sensing and actuating capabilities of specialized peer
robots. VNS-based robots can also self-heal by removing or replacing
malfunctioning body parts, including the brain."
"Whole Body Operational Space Control (WBOSC) is a pioneering algorithm in the
field of human-centered Whole-Body Control (WBC). It enables floating-base
highly-redundant robots to achieve unified motion/force control of one or more
operational space objectives while adhering to physical constraints. Limited
studies exist on the software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to
perform and be integrated into a larger system. In this paper we address this
by presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC.
Unlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to increase servo
frequencies on standard PC hardware. A new parameter binding mechanism enables
tight integration between ControlIt! and external processes via an extensible
set of transport protocols. To support a new robot, only two plugins and a URDF
model needs to be provided --- the rest of ControlIt! remains unchanged. New
WBC primitives can be added by writing a Task or Constraint plugin.
ControlIt!'s capabilities are demonstrated on Dreamer, a 16-DOF torque
controlled humanoid upper body robot containing both series elastic and
co-actuated joints, and using it to perform a product disassembly task. Using
this testbed, we show that ControlIt! can achieve average servo latencies of
about 0.5ms when configured with two Cartesian position tasks, two orientation
tasks, and a lower priority posture task. This is significantly higher than the
5ms that was achieved using UTA-WBC, the prototype implementation of WBOSC that
is both application and platform-specific. Variations in the product's position
is handled by updating the goal of the Cartesian position task. ControlIt!'s
source code is released under an LGPL license and we hope it will be adopted
and maintained by the WBC community for the long term as a platform for WBC
development and integration."
"In the recent past, several sampling-based algorithms have been proposed to
compute trajectories that are collision-free and dynamically-feasible. However,
the outputs of such algorithms are notoriously jagged. In this paper, by
focusing on robots with car-like dynamics, we present a fast and simple
heuristic algorithm, named Convex Elastic Smoothing (CES) algorithm, for
trajectory smoothing and speed optimization. The CES algorithm is inspired by
earlier work on elastic band planning and iteratively performs shape and speed
optimization. The key feature of the algorithm is that both optimization
problems can be solved via convex programming, making CES particularly fast. A
range of numerical experiments show that the CES algorithm returns high-quality
solutions in a matter of a few hundreds of milliseconds and hence appears
amenable to a real-time implementation."
"The visual cue of optical flow plays a major role in the navigation of flying
insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A
major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance
estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to
distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to
estimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control
inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control
gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the
distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first
starts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability.
The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major
attractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the
robot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be
estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The
stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with
a Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final
approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2)
estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire
landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the
'edge of oscillation'."
"Planning under uncertainty is a key requirement for physical systems due to
the noisy nature of actuators and sensors. Using a belief space approach,
planning solutions tend to generate actions that result in information seeking
behavior which reduce state uncertainty. While recent work has dealt with
planning for Gaussian beliefs, for many cases, a multi-modal belief is a more
accurate representation of the underlying belief. This is particularly true in
environments with information symmetry that cause uncertain data associations
which naturally lead to a multi-modal hypothesis on the state. Thus, a planner
cannot simply base actions on the most-likely state. We propose an algorithm
that uses a Receding Horizon Planning approach to plan actions that
sequentially disambiguate the multi-modal belief to a uni-modal Gaussian and
achieve tight localization on the true state, called a Multi-Modal Motion
Planner (M3P). By combining a Gaussian sampling-based belief space planner with
M3P, and introducing a switching behavior in the planner and belief
representation, we present a holistic end-to-end solution for the belief space
planning problem. Simulation results for a 2D ground robot navigation problem
are presented that demonstrate our method's performance."
"Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has a long history in describing
running behavior in animals and humans as well as has been used as a design
basis for robots capable of dynamic locomotion. Anchoring the SLIP for lossy
physical systems resulted in newer models which are extended versions of
original SLIP with viscous damping in the leg. However, such lossy models
require an additional mechanism for pumping energy to the system to control the
locomotion and to reach a limit-cycle. Some studies solved this problem by
adding an actively controllable torque actuation at the hip joint and this
actuation has been successively used in many robotic platforms, such as the
popular RHex robot. However, hip torque actuation produces forces on the COM
dominantly at forward direction with respect to ground, making height control
challenging especially at slow speeds. The situation becomes more severe when
the horizontal speed of the robot reaches zero, i.e. steady hoping without
moving in horizontal direction, and the system reaches to singularity in which
vertical degrees of freedom is completely lost. To this end, we propose an
extension of the lossy SLIP model with a slider-crank mechanism, SLIP- SCM,
that can generate a stable limit-cycle when the body is constrained to vertical
direction. We propose an approximate analytical solution to the nonlinear
system dynamics of SLIP- SCM model to characterize its behavior during the
locomotion. Finally, we perform a fixed-point stability analysis on SLIP-SCM
model using our approximate analytical solution and show that proposed model
exhibits stable behavior in our range of interest."
"In our prior work, we outlined an approach, named DisCoF, for cooperative
pathfinding in distributed systems with limited sensing and communication
range. Contrasting to prior works on cooperative pathfinding with completeness
guarantees, which often assume the access to global information, DisCoF does
not make this assumption. The implication is that at any given time in DisCoF,
the robots may not all be aware of each other, which is often the case in
distributed systems. As a result, DisCoF represents an inherently online
approach since coordination can only be realized in an opportunistic manner
between robots that are within each other's sensing and communication range.
However, there are a few assumptions made in DisCoF to facilitate a formal
analysis, which must be removed to work with distributed multi-robot platforms.
In this paper, we present DisCoF$^+$, which extends DisCoF by enabling an
asynchronous solution, as well as providing flexible decoupling between robots
for performance improvement. We also extend the formal results of DisCoF to
DisCoF$^+$. Furthermore, we evaluate our implementation of DisCoF$^+$ and
demonstrate a simulation of it running in a distributed multi-robot
environment. Finally, we compare DisCoF$^+$ with DisCoF in terms of plan
quality and planning performance."
"We present an initial examination of a novel approach to accurately position
a patient during head and neck intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
Position-based visual-servoing of a radio-transparent soft robot is used to
control the flexion/extension cranial motion of a manikin head. A Kinect RGB-D
camera is used to measure head position and the error between the sensed and
desired position is used to control a pneumatic system which regulates pressure
within an inflatable air bladder (IAB). Results show that the system is capable
of controlling head motion to within 2mm with respect to a reference
trajectory. This establishes proof-of-concept that using multiple IABs and
actuators can improve cancer treatment."
"In this study we describe the development of a ride assistance application
which can be implemented on the widespread smart phones and tablet. The ride
assistance application has a signal processing and pattern classification
module which yield almost 100% recognition accuracy for real-time signal
pattern classification. We introduce a novel framework to build a training
dictionary with an overwhelming discriminating capacity which eliminates the
need of human intervention spotting the pattern on the training samples. We
verify the recognition accuracy of the proposed methodologies by providing the
results of another study in which the hand posture and gestures are tracked and
recognized for steering a robotic wheelchair."
"The swing-twist decomposition is a standard routine in motion planning for
humanoid limbs. In this paper the decomposition formulas are derived and
discussed in terms of Clifford algebra. With the decomposition one can express
an arbitrary spinor as a product of a twist-free spinor and a swing-free spinor
(or vice-versa) in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. It is shown that in the
derived decomposition formula the twist factor is a generalized projection of a
spinor onto a vector in Clifford algebra. As a practical application of the
introduced theory an optimized decomposition algorithm is proposed. It
favourably compares to existing swing-twist decomposition implementations."
"We explore the probabilistic foundations of shared control in complex dynamic
environments. In order to do this, we formulate shared control as a random
process and describe the joint distribution that governs its behavior. For
tractability, we model the relationships between the operator, autonomy, and
crowd as an undirected graphical model. Further, we introduce an interaction
function between the operator and the robot, that we call ""agreeability""; in
combination with the methods developed in~\cite{trautman-ijrr-2015}, we extend
a cooperative collision avoidance autonomy to shared control. We therefore
quantify the notion of simultaneously optimizing over agreeability (between the
operator and autonomy), and safety and efficiency in crowded environments. We
show that for a particular form of interaction function between the autonomy
and the operator, linear blending is recovered exactly. Additionally, to
recover linear blending, unimodal restrictions must be placed on the models
describing the operator and the autonomy. In turn, these restrictions raise
questions about the flexibility and applicability of the linear blending
framework. Additionally, we present an extension of linear blending called
""operator biased linear trajectory blending"" (which formalizes some recent
approaches in linear blending such as~\cite{dragan-ijrr-2013}) and show that
not only is this also a restrictive special case of our probabilistic approach,
but more importantly, is statistically unsound, and thus, mathematically,
unsuitable for implementation. Instead, we suggest a statistically principled
approach that guarantees data is used in a consistent manner, and show how this
alternative approach converges to the full probabilistic framework. We conclude
by proving that, in general, linear blending is suboptimal with respect to the
joint metric of agreeability, safety, and efficiency."
"The project which we have performed is based on voice recognition and we
desire to create a four legged robot that can acknowledge the given
instructions which are given through vocal commands and perform the tasks. The
main processing unit of the robot will be Arduino Uno. We are using 8 servos
for the movement of its legs while two servos will be required for each leg.
The interface between a human and the robot is generated through Python
programming and Eclipse software and it is implemented by using Bluetooth
module HC 06."
"One major challenge in implementation of formation control problems stems
from the packet loss that occur in these shared communication channel. In the
presence of packet loss the coordination information among agents is lost.
Moreover, there is a move to use wireless channels in formation control
applications. It has been found in practice that packet losses are more
pronounced in wireless channels, than their wired counterparts. In our
analysis, we first show that packet loss may result in loss of rigidity. In
turn this causes the entire formation to fail. Later, we present an estimation
based formation control algorithm that is robust to packet loss among agents.
The proposed estimation algorithm employs minimal spanning tree algorithm to
compute the estimate of the node variables (coordination variables).
Consequently, this reduces the communication overhead required for information
exchange. Later, using simulation, we verify the data that is to be transmitted
for optimal estimation of these variables in the event of a packet loss.
Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using
suitable simulation example."
"We introduce the use of hierarchical clustering for relaxed, deterministic
coordination and control of multiple robots. Traditionally an unsupervised
learning method, hierarchical clustering offers a formalism for identifying and
representing spatially cohesive and segregated robot groups at different
resolutions by relating the continuous space of configurations to the
combinatorial space of trees. We formalize and exploit this relation,
developing computationally effective reactive algorithms for navigating through
the combinatorial space in concert with geometric realizations for a particular
choice of hierarchical clustering method. These constructions yield
computationally effective vector field planners for both hierarchically
invariant as well as transitional navigation in the configuration space. We
apply these methods to the centralized coordination and control of $n$
perfectly sensed and actuated Euclidean spheres in a $d$-dimensional ambient
space (for arbitrary $n$ and $d$). Given a desired configuration supporting a
desired hierarchy, we construct a hybrid controller which is quadratic in $n$
and algebraic in $d$ and prove that its execution brings all but a measure zero
set of initial configurations to the desired goal with the guarantee of no
collisions along the way."
"In this paper we present control strategies for implementing reconfigurable
planar microassmbly using multiple stress-engineered MEMS microrobots
(MicroStressBots). A MicroStressBot is an electrostatic microrobot that
consists of an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA) that provides forward
motion, and a steering-arm actuator that determines whether the robot moves in
straight line or turns. The steering-arm is actuated through electrostatic
pull-down to the substrate initiated by the applied global power delivery and
control signal. Control of multiple MicroStressBots is achieved by varying the
geometry of the steering-arm, and hence affecting its electrostatic pull-down
and/or release voltages. Independent control of many MicroStressBots is
achieved by fabricating the arms of the individual microrobots in such a way
that the robots move differently from one another during portions of the global
control signal. In this paper we analyze the scalability of control in an
obstacle free configuration space. Based on robust control strategies, we
derive the control signals that command some of the robots to make progress
toward the goal, while the others stay in small orbits, for several classes of
steering-arm geometries. We also present a comprehensive analysis and
comparison between the numbers of required independent pull-down and release
voltages, demonstrating significant improvement in terms of the efficiency as
well as the size of the control signal presented in past work. Our analysis
presents an important step for developing multi-microrobots control of
MicroStressBots."
"Bio-inspired vehicles are currently leading the way in the quest to produce a
vehicle capable of flight and underwater navigation. However, a fully
functional vehicle has not yet been realized. We present the first fully
functional vehicle platform operating in air and underwater with seamless
transition between both mediums. These unique capabilities combined with the
hovering, high maneuverability and reliability of multirotor vehicles, results
in a disruptive technology for both civil and military application including
air/water search and rescue, inspection, repairs and survey missions among
others. The invention was built on a bio-inspired locomotion force analysis
that combines flight and swimming. Three main advances in the present work has
allowed this invention. The first is the discovery of a seamless transition
method between air and underwater. The second is the design of a multi-medium
propulsion system capable of efficient operation in air and underwater. The
third combines the requirements for lift and thrust for flight (for a given
weight) and the requirements for thrust and neutral buoyancy (in water) for
swimming. The result is a careful balance between lift, thrust, weight, and
neutral buoyancy implemented in the vehicle design. A fully operational
prototype demonstrated the flight, and underwater navigation capabilities as
well as the rapid air/water and water/air transition."
"Many robotic tasks rely on the accurate localization of moving objects within
a given workspace. This information about the objects' poses and velocities are
used for control,motion planning, navigation, interaction with the environment
or verification. Often motion capture systems are used to obtain such a state
estimate. However, these systems are often costly, limited in workspace size
and not suitable for outdoor usage. Therefore, we propose a lightweight and
easy to use, visual-inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping approach
that leverages cost-efficient, paper printable artificial landmarks, socalled
fiducials. Results show that by fusing visual and inertial data, the system
provides accurate estimates and is robust against fast motions and changing
lighting conditions. Tight integration of the estimation of sensor and fiducial
pose as well as extrinsics ensures accuracy, map consistency and avoids the
requirement for precalibration. By providing an open source implementation and
various datasets, partially with ground truth information, we enable community
members to run, test, modify and extend the system either using these datasets
or directly running the system on their own robotic setups."
"We present a new vision for smart objects and the Internet of Things wherein
mobile robots interact with wirelessly-powered, long-range, ultra-high
frequency radio frequency identification (UHF RFID) tags outfitted with sensing
capabilities. We explore the technology innovations driving this vision by
examining recently-commercialized sensor tags that could be affixed-to or
embedded-in objects or the environment to yield true embodied intelligence.
Using a pair of autonomous mobile robots outfitted with UHF RFID readers, we
explore several potential applications where mobile robots interact with sensor
tags to perform tasks such as: soil moisture sensing, remote crop monitoring,
infrastructure monitoring, water quality monitoring, and remote sensor
deployment."
"In this paper we focus on the challenging problem of place categorization and
semantic mapping on a robot without environment-specific training. Motivated by
their ongoing success in various visual recognition tasks, we build our system
upon a state-of-the-art convolutional network. We overcome its closed-set
limitations by complementing the network with a series of one-vs-all
classifiers that can learn to recognize new semantic classes online. Prior
domain knowledge is incorporated by embedding the classification system into a
Bayesian filter framework that also ensures temporal coherence. We evaluate the
classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places
on our campus in real-time. We show how semantic information can boost robotic
object detection performance and how the semantic map can be used to modulate
the robot's behaviour during navigation tasks. The system is made available to
the community as a ROS module."
"In this paper, we present an approach for dynamic exploration and mapping of
unknown environments using a swarm of biobotic sensing agents, with a
stochastic natural motion model and a leading agent (e.g., an unmanned aerial
vehicle). The proposed robust mapping technique constructs a topological map of
the environment using only encounter information from the swarm. A sliding
window strategy is adopted in conjunction with a topological mapping strategy
based on local interactions among the swarm in a coordinate-free fashion to
obtain local maps of the environment. These maps are then merged into a global
topological map which can be visualized using a graphical representation that
integrates geometric as well as topological feature of the environment.
Localized robust topological features are extracted using tools from
topological data analysis. Simulation results have been presented to illustrate
and verify the correctness of our dynamic mapping algorithm."
"We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs (MPP)
over four distinct minimization objectives: the total arrival time, the
makespan (last arrival time), the total distance, and the maximum (single-robot
traveled) distance. On the structure side, we show that each pair of these four
objectives induces a Pareto front and cannot always be optimized
simultaneously. Then, through reductions from 3-SAT, we further establish that
computation over each objective is an NP-hard task, providing evidence that
solving MPP optimally is generally intractable. Nevertheless, in a related
paper, we design complete algorithms and efficient heuristics for optimizing
all four objectives, capable of solving MPP optimally or near-optimally for
hundreds of robots in challenging setups."
"We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs MPP over
four distinct minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), the
maximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the total
distance. In a related paper, we show that these objectives are distinct and
NP-hard to optimize. In this work, we focus on efficiently algorithmic
solutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we first
establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and network-flow. Based on
this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and
complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In
particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a
first such that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with
robot-vertex ratio as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computational
performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled
heuristics, at the expense of some optimality loss. The combination of ILP
model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective,
allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing
hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just
seconds."
"Probabilistic Cell Decomposition (PCD) is a probabilistic path planning
method combining the concepts of approximate cell decomposition with
probabilistic sampling. It has been shown that the use of lazy evaluation
techniques and supervised sampling in important areas result in a high
performance path planning method. Even if it was postulated before that PCD is
probabilistically complete, we present a detailed proof of probabilistic
completeness here for the first time."
"Simplified models of the dynamics such as the linear inverted pendulum model
(LIPM) have proven to perform well for biped walking on flat ground. However,
for more complex tasks the assumptions of these models can become limiting. For
example, the LIPM does not allow for the control of contact forces
independently, is limited to co-planar contacts and assumes that the angular
momentum is zero. In this paper, we propose to use the full momentum equations
of a humanoid robot in a trajectory optimization framework to plan its center
of mass, linear and angular momentum trajectories. The model also allows for
planning desired contact forces for each end-effector in arbitrary contact
locations. We extend our previous results on LQR design for momentum control by
computing the (linearized) optimal momentum feedback law in a receding horizon
fashion. The resulting desired momentum and the associated feedback law are
then used in a hierarchical whole body control approach. Simulation experiments
show that the approach is computationally fast and is able to generate plans
for locomotion on complex terrains while demonstrating good tracking
performance for the full humanoid control."
"This work presents approaches for the estimation of quantities important for
the control of the momentum of a humanoid robot. In contrast to previous
approaches which use simplified models such as the Linear Inverted Pendulum
Model, we present estimators based on the momentum dynamics of the robot. By
using this simple yet dynamically-consistent model, we avoid the issues of
using simplified models for estimation. We develop an estimator for the center
of mass and full momentum which can be reformulated to estimate center of mass
offsets as well as external wrenches applied to the robot. The observability of
these estimators is investigated and their performance is evaluated in
comparison to previous approaches."
"Bi-directional search is a widely used strategy to increase the success and
convergence rates of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Yet, few
results are available that merge both bi-directional search and asymptotic
optimality into existing optimal planners, such as PRM*, RRT*, and FMT*. The
objective of this paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, this paper presents
a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptotically-optimal algorithm named
Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*)
algorithm to bi-directional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly
lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT*
performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of
randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in
cost-to-come space from the initial configuration and another in cost-to-go
space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the
advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of
other state-of-the-art planners."
"When executing whole-body motions, humans are able to use a large variety of
support poses which not only utilize the feet, but also hands, knees and elbows
to enhance stability. While there are many works analyzing the transitions
involved in walking, very few works analyze human motion where more complex
supports occur.
  In this work, we analyze complex support pose transitions in human motion
involving locomotion and manipulation tasks (loco-manipulation). We have
applied a method for the detection of human support contacts from motion
capture data to a large-scale dataset of loco-manipulation motions involving
multi-contact supports, providing a semantic representation of them. Our
results provide a statistical analysis of the used support poses, their
transitions and the time spent in each of them. In addition, our data partially
validates our taxonomy of whole-body support poses presented in our previous
work.
  We believe that this work extends our understanding of human motion for
humanoids, with a long-term objective of developing methods for autonomous
multi-contact motion planning."
"We discuss some of the challenges facing shared autonomy. In particular, we
explore 1) shared autonomy over unreliable networks, 2) how we can model
individual human operators (in contrast to the average of a human operator),
and 3) how our approach naturally models and integrates sliding autonomy into
the joint human-machine system. We include a Background Section for
completeness."
"We study parametric equations, which describe the position of an in-parallel
planar manipulator. We discuss isometries in the Gauss plane, then we write the
loop-closure equations in terms of the rotations as the parameters."
"This paper studies path synthesis for nonholonomic mobile robots moving in
two-dimensional space. We first address the problem of interpolating paths
expressed as sequences of straight line segments, such as those produced by
some planning algorithms, into smooth curves that can be followed without
stopping. Our solution has the advantage of being simpler than other existing
approaches, and has a low computational cost that allows a real-time
implementation. It produces discretized paths on which curvature and variation
of curvature are bounded at all points, and preserves obstacle clearance. Then,
we consider the problem of computing a time-optimal speed profile for such
paths. We introduce an algorithm that solves this problem in linear time, and
that is able to take into account a broader class of physical constraints than
other solutions. Our contributions have been implemented and evaluated in the
framework of the Eurobot contest."
"This paper addresses the design and development of an autonomous biped robot
using master and worker combination of controllers. In addition, the bot is
wirelessly controllable. The work presented here explains the walking pattern,
system control and actuator control techniques for 10 Degree of Freedom (DOF)
biped humanoid. Bi-pedal robots have better mobility than conventional wheeled
robots, but they tend to topple easily. In order to walk stably in various
environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions
containing obstacles, it is necessary, that robot should adapt to the ground
conditions with a foot motion, as well as maintain its stability with a torso
motion. It is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque
and velocity of the joint actuators. The work proposed a low cost solution
using open source hardware-software and application. The work extends to
develop and implement new algorithms by adding gyroscope and accelerometer to
further the research in the field of biped robots."
"A mobile robot deployed for remote inspection, surveying or rescue missions
can fail due to various possibilities and can be hardware or software related.
These failure scenarios necessitate manual recovery (self-rescue) of the robot
from the environment. It would bring unforeseen challenges to recover the
mobile robot if the environment where it was deployed had hazardous or harmful
conditions (e.g. ionizing radiations). While it is not fully possible to
predict all the failures in the robot, failures can be reduced by employing
certain design/usage considerations. Few example failure cases based on real
experiences are presented in this short article along with generic suggestions
on overcoming the illustrated failure situations."
"This paper introduces a novel motion planning algorithm for stochastic
scenarios. We extend the concept of a navigation function to such scenarios.
Our main idea is to consider both the Gaussian distribution probabilities of
the players' locations and disc (or star sets) geometry of the objects
operating in the work space. We do so by formulating a probability density
function that encloses both. We use the PDF to define a metric between the
robot, the obstacles and the configuration space boundary. In order to define
the navigation function we formulate a safe probability value for collision. By
analytically investigating the PDF we find a convenient approximation for a
safe distance in the sense of that metric. We prove that the resulting map is a
navigation function and demonstrate our algorithm for various scenarios."
"We study the problem of capturing an Omnidirectional Evader in convex
environments using a Differential Drive Robot (DDR). The DDR wins the game if
at any time instant it captures (collides with) the evader. The evader wins if
it can avoid capture forever. Both players are unit disks with the same maximum
(bounded) speed, but the DDR can only change its motion direction at a bounded
rate. We show that despite this limitation, the DDR can capture the evader."
"In manipulation tasks, a robot interacts with movable object(s). The
configuration space in manipulation planning is thus the Cartesian product of
the configuration space of the robot with those of the movable objects. It is
the complex structure of such a ""Composite Configuration Space"" that makes
manipulation planning particularly challenging. Previous works approximate the
connectivity of the Composite Configuration Space by means of discretization or
by creating random roadmaps. Such approaches involve an extensive
pre-processing phase, which furthermore has to be re-done each time the
environment changes. In this paper, we propose a high-level Grasp-Placement
Table similar to that proposed by Tournassoud et al. (1987), but which does not
require any discretization or heavy pre-processing. The table captures the
potential connectivity of the Composite Configuration Space while being
specific only to the movable object: in particular, it does not require to be
re-computed when the environment changes. During the query phase, the table is
used to guide a tree-based planner that explores the space systematically. Our
simulations and experiments show that the proposed method enables improvements
in both running time and trajectory quality as compared to existing approaches."
"In this paper, we propose a new method for path planning to a point for robot
in environment with obstacles. The resulting algorithm is implemented as a
simple variation of Dijkstra's algorithm. By adding a constraint to the
shortest-path, the algorithm is able to exclude all the paths between two
points that violate the constraint.This algorithm provides the robot the
possibility to move from the initial position to the final position (target)
when we have enough samples in the domain. In this case the robot follows a
smooth path that does not fall in to the obstacles. Our method is simpler than
the previous proposals in the literature and performs comparably to the best
methods, both on simulated and some real datasets."
"In this paper we consider the problem of coordinating robotic systems with
different kinematics, sensing and vision capabilities to achieve certain
mission goals. An approach that makes use of a heterogeneous team of agents has
several advantages when cost, integration of capabilities, or large search
areas need to be considered. A heterogeneous team allows for the robots to
become ""specialized"", accomplish sub-goals more effectively, and thus increase
the overall mission efficiency. Two main scenarios are considered in this work.
In the first case study we exploit mobility to implement a power control
algorithm that increases the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)
among certain members of the network. We create realistic sensing fields and
manipulation by using the geometric properties of the sensor field-of-view and
the manipulability metric, respectively. The control strategy for each agent of
the heterogeneous system is governed by an artificial physics law that
considers the different kinematics of the agents and the environment, in a
decentralized fashion. Through simulation results we show that the network is
able to stay connected at all times and covers the environment well. The second
scenario studied in this paper is the biologically-inspired coordination of
heterogeneous physical robotic systems. A team of ground rovers, designed to
emulate desert seed-harvester ants, explore an experimental area using
behaviors fine-tuned in simulation by a genetic algorithm. Our robots
coordinate with a base station and collect clusters of resources scattered
within the experimental space. We demonstrate experimentally that through
coordination with an aerial vehicle, our ant-like ground robots are able to
collect resources two times faster than without the use of heterogeneous
coordination."
"One of the most fundamental problems when designing controllers for dynamic
systems is the tuning of the controller parameters. Typically, a model of the
system is used to obtain an initial controller, but ultimately the controller
parameters must be tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best
performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, methods from machine learning,
such as Bayesian optimization, have been used. However, as these methods
evaluate different controller parameters on the real system, safety-critical
system failures may happen. In this paper, we overcome this problem by
applying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm,
SafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an
initial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the
parameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying
performance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller
parameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high
probability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the
proposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller
parameters without human intervention."
"Monocular motion cues have been widely used by Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) to
detect obstacles during visual navigation. However, this approach requires
significant movement, which reduces the efficiency of navigation and may even
introduce risks in narrow spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel setup of
self-supervised learning (SSL), in which motion cues serve as a scaffold to
learn the visual appearance of obstacles in the environment. We apply it to a
landing task, in which initially 'surface roughness' is estimated from the
optical flow field in order to detect obstacles. Subsequently, a regression
function is learned that maps appearance features represented by texton
distributions to a surface roughness estimate. After learning, the MAV can
detect obstacles by just analyzing a still image. This allows the MAV to search
for a landing spot without moving. We first demonstrate this principle to work
with offline tests involving images captured from an on-board camera, and then
demonstrate the principle in flight. Although surface roughness is a property
of the entire flow field in the global image, the appearance learning even
allows for the pixel-wise segmentation of obstacles."
"The object of the research is the adaptive algorithms that are used by the
operator when educating the robotic systems. Operator, being the target-setting
subject, is interested in the goal that robotic systems, being the conductor of
his targets (criteria), would provide a maximum effectiveness of these targets'
(criteria's) achievement. Thus, the adaptive algorithms provide the adequate
reflection of the operator's goals, found in the robotic systems' actions. This
work considers potential possibilities of such target adaption of the robotic
systems used for the class of the allocation problems."
"Herein we suggest a mobile robot-training algorithm that is based on the
preference approximation of the decision taker who controls the robot, which in
its turn is managed by the Markov chain. Setup of the model parameters is made
on the basis of the data referring to the situations and decisions involving
the decision taker. The model that adapts to the decision taker's preferences
can be set up either a priori, during the process of the robot's normal
operation, or during specially planned testing sessions. Basing on the
simulation modelling data of the robot's operation process and on the decision
taker's robot control we have set up the model parameters thus illustrating
both working capacity of all algorithm components and adaptation effectiveness."
"Magnetometer has received wide applications in attitude determination and
scientific measurements. Calibration is an important step for any practical
magnetometer use. The most popular three-axis magnetometer calibration methods
are attitude-independent and have been founded on an approximate maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation with a quartic subjective function, derived from the
fact that the magnitude of the calibrated measurements should be constant in a
homogeneous magnetic field. This paper highlights the shortcomings of those
popular methods and proposes to use the quadratic optimal ML estimation instead
for magnetometer calibration. Simulation and test results show that the optimal
ML calibration is superior to the approximate ML methods for magnetometer
calibration in both accuracy and stability, especially for those situations
without sufficient attitude excitation. The significant benefits deserve the
moderately increased computation burden. The main conclusion obtained in the
context of magnetometer in this paper is potentially applicable to various
kinds of three-axis sensors."
"Research in mobile robotics often demands platforms that have an adequate
balance between cost and reliability. In the case of terrestrial robots, one of
the available options is the GNBot, an open-hardware project intended for the
evaluation of swarm search strategies. The lack of basic odometry sensors such
as wheel encoders had so far difficulted the implementation of an accurate
high-level controller in this platform. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to
improve motion control in the GNBot by incorporating a gyroscope whilst
maintaining the requisite of no wheel encoders. Among the problems that have
been tackled are: accurate in-place rotations, minimal drift during linear
motions, and arc-performing functionality. Additionally, the resulting
controller is calibrated autonomously by using both the gyroscope module and
the infrared rangefinder on board each robot, greatly simplifying the
calibration of large swarms. The report first explains the design decisions
that were made in order to implement the self-calibration routine, and then
evaluates the performance of the new motion controller by means of off-line
video tracking. The motion accuracy of the new controller is also compared with
the previously existing solution in an odor search experiment."
"The goal of this paper is to develop efficient regrasp algorithms for
single-arm and dual-arm regrasp and compares the performance of single-arm and
dual-arm regrasp by running the two algorithms thousands of times. We focus on
pick-and-place regrasp which reorients an object from one placement to another
by using a sequence of pick-ups and place-downs. After analyzing the simulation
results, we find dual-arm regrasp is not necessarily better than single-arm
regrasp: Dual-arm regrasp is flexible. When the two hands can grasp the object
with good clearance, dual-arm regrasp is better and has higher successful rate
than single-arm regrasp. However, dual-arm regrasp suffers from geometric
constraints caused by the two arms. When the grasps overlap, dual-arm regrasp
is bad. Developers need to sample grasps with high density to reduce
overlapping. This leads to exploded combinatorics in previous methods, but is
possible with the algorithms presented in this paper. Following the results,
practitioners may choose single-arm or dual-arm robots by considering the
object shapes and grasps. Meanwhile, they can reduce overlapping and implement
practical dual-arm regrasp by using the presented algorithms."
"The goal of this paper is to present the design and development of a low cost
cargo transit system which can be adapted in developing countries like India
where there is abundant and cheap human labour which makes the process of
automation in any industry a challenge to innovators. The need of the hour is
an automation system that can diligently transfer cargo from one place to
another and minimize human intervention in the cargo transit industry.
Therefore, a solution is being proposed which could effectively bring down
human labour and the resources needed to implement them. The reduction in human
labour and resources is achieved by the use of low cost components and very
limited modification of the surroundings and the existing vehicles themselves.
The operation of the cargo transit system has been verified and the relevant
results are presented. An economical and robust cargo transit system is
designed and implemented."
"Inverse dynamics is used extensively in robotics and biomechanics
applications. In manipulator and legged robots, it can form the basis of an
effective nonlinear control strategy by providing a robot with both accurate
positional tracking and active compliance. In biomechanics applications,
inverse dynamics control can approximately determine the net torques applied at
anatomical joints that correspond to an observed motion.
  In the context of robot control, using inverse dynamics requires knowledge of
all contact forces acting on the robot; accurately perceiving external forces
applied to the robot requires filtering and thus significant time delay. An
alternative approach has been suggested in recent literature: predicting
contact and actuator forces simultaneously under the assumptions of rigid body
dynamics, rigid contact, and friction. Existing such inverse dynamics
approaches have used approximations to the contact models, which permits use of
fast numerical linear algebra algorithms. In contrast, we describe inverse
dynamics algorithms that are derived only from first principles and use
established phenomenological models like Coulomb friction.
  We assess these inverse dynamics algorithms in a control context using two
virtual robots: a locomoting quadrupedal robot and a fixed-based manipulator
gripping a box while using perfectly accurate sensor data from simulation. The
data collected from these experiments gives an upper bound on the performance
of such controllers in situ. For points of comparison, we assess performance on
the same tasks with both error feedback control and inverse dynamics control
with virtual contact force sensing."
"This paper describes the synthesis and evaluation of a novel state estimator
for a Quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicle. Dynamic equations which relate
acceleration, attitude and the aero-dynamic propeller drag are encapsulated in
an extended Kalman filter framework for estimating the velocity and the
attitude of the quadrotor. It is demonstrated that exploiting the relationship
between the body frame accelerations and velocities, due to blade flapping,
enables drift free estimation of lateral and longitudinal components of body
frame translational velocity along with improvements to roll and pitch
components of body attitude estimations. Real world data sets gathered using a
commercial off-the-shelf quadrotor platform, together with ground truth data
from a Vicon system, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm."
"In distributed mobile sensing applications, networks of agents that are
heterogeneous respecting both actuation as well as body and sensory footprint
are often modelled by recourse to power diagrams --- generalized Voronoi
diagrams with additive weights. In this paper we adapt the body power diagram
to introduce its ""free subdiagram,"" generating a vector field planner that
solves the combined sensory coverage and collision avoidance problem via
continuous evaluation of an associated constrained optimization problem. We
propose practical extensions (a heuristic congestion manager that speeds
convergence and a lift of the point particle controller to the more practical
differential drive kinematics) that maintain the convergence and collision
guarantees."
"Fine robotic assembly, in which the parts to be assembled are small and
fragile and lie in an unstructured environment, is still out of reach of
today's industrial robots. The main difficulties arise in the precise
localization of the parts in an unstructured environment and the control of
contact interactions. Our contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we
propose a taxonomy of the manipulation primitives that are specifically
involved in fine assembly. Such a taxonomy is crucial for designing a scalable
robotic system (both hardware and software) given the complexity of real-world
assembly tasks. Second, we present a hardware and software architecture where
we have addressed, in an integrated way, a number of issues arising in fine
assembly, such as workspace optimization, external wrench compensation,
position-based force control, etc. Finally, we show the above taxonomy and
architecture in action on a highly dexterous task -- bimanual pin insertion --
which is one of the key steps in our long term project, the autonomous assembly
of an IKEA chair."
"Collaborative robots could transform several industries, such as
manufacturing and healthcare, but they present a significant challenge to
verification. The complex nature of their working environment necessitates
testing in realistic detail under a broad range of circumstances. We propose
the use of Coverage-Driven Verification (CDV) to meet this challenge. By
automating the simulation-based testing process as far as possible, CDV
provides an efficient route to coverage closure. We discuss the need, practical
considerations, and potential benefits of transferring this approach from
microelectronic design verification to the field of human-robot interaction. We
demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach by
constructing a custom CDV testbench and applying it to the verification of an
object handover task."
"One of the goals of computer-aided surgery is to match intraoperative data to
preoperative images of the anatomy and add complementary information that can
facilitate the task of surgical navigation. In this context, mechanical
palpation can reveal critical anatomical features such as arteries and
cancerous lumps which are stiffer that the surrounding tissue. This work uses
position and force measurements obtained during mechanical palpation for
registration and stiffness mapping. Prior approaches, including our own,
exhaustively palpated the entire organ to achieve this goal. To overcome the
costly palpation of the entire organ, a Bayesian optimization framework is
introduced to guide the end effector to palpate stiff regions while
simultaneously updating the registration of the end effector to an a priori
geometric model of the organ, hence enabling the fusion of ntraoperative data
into the a priori model obtained through imaging. This new framework uses
Gaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and Bayesian
optimization to direct where to sample next for maximum information gain. The
proposed method was evaluated with experimental data obtained using a Cartesian
robot interacting with a silicone organ model and an ex vivo porcine liver."
"The deformable and continuum nature of soft robots promises versatility and
adaptability. However, control of modular, multi-limbed soft robots for
terrestrial locomotion is challenging due to the complex robot structure,
actuator mechanics and robot-environment interaction. Traditionally, soft robot
control is performed by modeling kinematics using exact geometric equations and
finite element analysis. The research presents an alternative, model-free,
data-driven, reinforcement learning inspired approach, for controlling
multi-limbed soft material robots. This control approach can be summarized as a
four-step process of discretization, visualization, learning and optimization.
The first step involves identification and subsequent discretization of key
factors that dominate robot-environment, in turn, the robot control. Graph
theory is used to visualize relationships and transitions between the
discretized states. The graph representation facilitates mathematical
definition of periodic control patterns (simple cycles) and locomotion gaits.
Rewards corresponding to individual arcs of the graph are weighted displacement
and orientation change for robot state-to-state transitions. These rewards are
specific to surface of locomotion and are learned. Finally, the control
patterns result from optimization of reward dependent locomotion task (e.g.
translation) cost function. The optimization problem is an Integer Linear
Programming problem which can be quickly solved using standard solvers. The
framework is generic and independent of type of actuator, soft material
properties or the type of friction mechanism, as the control exists in the
robot's task space. Furthermore, the data-driven nature of the framework
imparts adaptability to the framework toward different locomotion surfaces by
re-learning rewards."
"This paper describes a novel amphibious robot, which adopts a dual-swing-legs
propulsion mechanism, proposing a new locomotion mode. The robot is called
FroBot, since its structure and locomotion are similar to frogs. Our
inspiration comes from the frog scooter and breaststroke. Based on its swing
leg mechanism, an unusual universal wheel structure is used to generate
propulsion on land, while a pair of flexible caudal fins functions like the
foot flippers of a frog to generate similar propulsion underwater. On the basis
of the prototype design and the dynamic model of the robot, some locomotion
control simulations and experiments were conducted for the purpose of adjusting
the parameters that affect the propulsion of the robot. Finally, a series of
underwater experiments were performed to verify the design feasibility of
FroBot and the rationality of the control algorithm."
"Robots built from soft materials can alter their shape and size in a
particular profile. This shape-changing ability could be extremely helpful for
rescue robots and those operating in unknown terrains and environments. In
changing shape, soft materials also store and release elastic energy, a feature
that can be exploited for effective robot movement. However, design and control
of these moving soft robots are non-trivial. The research presents design
methodology for a 3D-printed, motor-tendon actuated soft robot capable of
locomotion. In addition to shape change, the robot uses friction manipulation
mechanisms to effect locomotion. The motor-tendon actuators comprise of nylon
tendons embedded inside the soft body structure along a given path with one end
fixed on the body and the other attached to a motor. These actuators directly
control the deformation of the soft body which influences the robot locomotion
behavior. Static stress analysis is used as a tool for designing the shape of
the paths of these tendons embedded inside the body. The research also presents
a novel model-free learning-based control approach for soft robots which
interact with the environment at discrete contact points. This approach
involves discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions as
states, learning of the results as robot transitions between these robot states
and evaluation of desired periodic state control sequences optimizing a cost
function corresponding to a locomotion task (rotation or translation). The
clever discretization allows the framework to exist in robot's task space,
hence, facilitating calculation of control sequences without modeling the
actuator, body material or details of the friction mechanisms. The flexibility
of the framework is experimentally explored by applying it to robots with
different friction mechanisms and different shapes of tendon paths."
"Soft materials have many important roles in animal locomotion and object
manipulation. In robotic applications soft materials can store and release
energy, absorb impacts, increase compliance and increase the range of possible
shape profiles using minimal actuators. The shape changing ability is also a
potential tool to manipulate friction forces caused by contact with the
environment. These advantages are accompanied by challenges of soft material
actuation and the need to exploit frictional interactions to generate
locomotion. Accordingly, the design of soft robots involves exploitation of
continuum properties of soft materials for manipulating frictional interactions
that result in robot locomotion. The research presents design and control of a
soft body robot that uses its shape change capability for locomotion. The
bioinspired (caterpillar) modular robot design is a soft monolithic body which
interacts with the environment at discrete contact points (caterpillar
prolegs). The deformable body is actuated by muscle-like shape memory alloy
coils and the discrete contact points manipulate friction in a binary manner.
This novel virtual grip mechanism combines two materials with different
coefficients of frictions (sticky-slippery) to control the robot-environment
friction interactions. The research also introduces a novel control concept
that discretizes the robot-environment-friction interaction into binary states.
This facilitates formulation of a control framework that is independent of the
specific actuator or soft material properties and can be applied to
multi-limbed soft robots. The transitions between individual robot states are
assigned a reward that allow optimized state transition control sequences to be
calculated. This conceptual framework is extremely versatile and we show how it
can be applied to situations in which the robot loses limb function."
"Active SLAM is the task of actively planning robot paths while simultaneously
building a map and localizing within. Existing work has focused on planning
paths with occupancy grid maps, which do not scale well and suffer from long
term drift. This work proposes a Topological Feature Graph (TFG) representation
that scales well and develops an active SLAM algorithm with it. The TFG uses
graphical models, which utilize independences between variables, and enables a
unified quantification of exploration and exploitation gains with a single
entropy metric. Hence, it facilitates a natural and principled balance between
map exploration and refinement. A probabilistic roadmap path-planner is used to
generate robot paths in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves better accuracy than a standard grid-map based
approach while requiring orders of magnitude less computation and memory
resources."
"Tensegrity robots are a class of compliant robots that have many desirable
traits when designing mass efficient systems that must interact with uncertain
environments. Various promising control approaches have been proposed for
tensegrity systems in simulation. Unfortunately, state estimation methods for
tensegrity robots have not yet been thoroughly studied.
  In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a state estimator for
tensegrity robots. This state estimator will enable existing and future control
algorithms to transfer from simulation to hardware. Our approach is based on
the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and combines inertial measurements, ultra
wideband time-of-flight ranging measurements, and actuator state information.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the SUPERball, a tensegrity
based planetary exploration robotic prototype. In particular, we conduct tests
for evaluating both the robot's success in estimating global position in
relation to fixed ranging base stations during rolling maneuvers as well as
local behavior due to small-amplitude deformations induced by cable actuation."
"This paper presents the behaviour control of a service robot for intelligent
object search in a domestic environment. A major challenge in service robotics
is to enable fetch-and-carry missions that are satisfying for the user in terms
of efficiency and human-oriented perception. The proposed behaviour controller
provides an informed intelligent search based on a semantic segmentation
framework for indoor scenes and integrates it with object recognition and
grasping. Instead of manually annotating search positions in the environment,
the framework automatically suggests likely locations to search for an object
based on contextual information, e.g. next to tables and shelves. In a
preliminary set of experiments we demonstrate that this behaviour control is as
efficient as using manually annotated locations. Moreover, we argue that our
approach will reduce the intensity of labour associated with programming
fetch-and-carry tasks for service robots and that it will be perceived as more
human-oriented."
"In this paper we present a new approach for dynamic motion planning for
legged robots. We formulate a trajectory optimization problem based on a
compact form of the robot dynamics. Such a form is obtained by projecting the
rigid body dynamics onto the null space of the Constraint Jacobian. As
consequence of the projection, contact forces are removed from the model but
their effects are still taken into account. This approach permits to solve the
optimal control problem of a floating base constrained multibody system while
avoiding the use of an explicit contact model. We use direct transcription to
numerically solve the optimization. As the contact forces are not part of the
decision variables the size of the resultant discrete mathematical program is
reduced and therefore solutions can be obtained in a tractable time. Using a
predefined sequence of contact configurations (phases), our approach solves
motions where contact switches occur. Transitions between phases are
automatically resolved without using a model for switching dynamics. We present
results on a hydraulic quadruped robot (HyQ), including single phase (standing,
crouching) as well as multiple phase (rearing, diagonal leg balancing and
stepping) dynamic motions."
"We propose a method for checking and enforcing multi-contact stability based
on the Zero-tilting Moment Point (ZMP). The key to our development is the
generalization of ZMP support areas to take into account (a) frictional
constraints and (b) multiple non-coplanar contacts. We introduce and
investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas. First, we characterize and provide
a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact
forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the full
support area. Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots using the Linear
Pendulum Mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM
induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal floors.
We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call pendular support
area. We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the pendular support area is
a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these
developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible
multi-contact motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging
multi-contact scenarios."
"Sensor gloves are popular input devices for a large variety of applications
including health monitoring, control of music instruments, learning sign
language, dexterous computer interfaces, and tele-operating robot hands. Many
commercial products as well as low-cost open source projects have been
developed. We discuss here how low-cost (approx. 250 EUROs) sensor gloves with
force feedback can be build, provide an open source software interface for
Matlab and present first results in learning object manipulation skills through
imitation learning on the humanoid robot iCub."
"We show that all self-motions of pentapods with linear platform of Type 1 and
Type 2 can be generated by line-symmetric motions. Thus this paper closes a gap
between the more than 100 year old works of Duporcq and Borel and the extensive
study of line-symmetric motions done by Krames in the 1930's. As a consequence
we also get a new solution set for the Borel Bricard problem. Moreover we
discuss the reality of self-motions and give a sufficient condition for the
design of linear pentapods of Type 1 and Type 2, which have a self-motion free
workspace."
"In this paper, we present a light-weight, multi- axis compliant tenegrity
joint that is biologically inspired by the human elbow. This tensegrity elbow
actuates by shortening and lengthening cable in a method inspired by muscular
actuation in a person. Unlike many series elastic actuators, this joint is
structurally compliant not just along each axis of rotation, but along other
axes as well. Compliant robotic joints are indispensable in unpredictable
environments, including ones where the robot must interface with a person. The
joint also addresses the need for functional redundancy and flexibility, traits
which are required for many applications that investigate the use of
biologically accurate robotic models."
"We introduce and show preliminary results of a fast randomized method that
finds a set of K paths lying in distinct homotopy classes. We frame the path
planning task as a graph search problem, where the navigation graph is based on
a Voronoi diagram. The search is biased by a cost function derived from the
social force model that is used to generate and select the paths. We compare
our method to Yen's algorithm, and empirically show that our approach is faster
to find a subset of homotopy classes. Furthermore our approach computes a set
of more diverse paths with respect to the baseline while obtaining a negligible
loss in path quality."
"The exploration of planetary surfaces is predominately unmanned, calling for
a landing vehicle and an autonomous and/or teleoperated rover. Artificial
intelligence and machine learning techniques can be leveraged for better
mission planning. This paper describes the coordinated use of both global
navigation and metaheuristic optimization algorithms to plan the safe,
efficient missions. The aim is to determine the least-cost combination of a
safe landing zone (LZ) and global path plan, where avoiding terrain hazards for
the lander and rover minimizes cost. Computer vision methods were used to
identify surface craters, mounds, and rocks as obstacles. Multiple search
methods were investigated for the rover global path plan. Several combinatorial
optimization algorithms were implemented to select the shortest distance path
as the preferred mission plan. Simulations were run for a sample Google Lunar X
Prize mission. The result of this study is an optimization scheme that path
plans with the A* search method, and uses simulated annealing to select ideal
LZ-path- goal combination for the mission. Simulation results show the methods
are effective in minimizing the risk of hazards and increasing efficiency. This
paper is specific to a lunar mission, but the resulting architecture may be
applied to a large variety of planetary missions and rovers."
"Industries such as flexible manufacturing and home care will be transformed
by the presence of robotic assistants. Assurance of safety and functional
soundness for these robotic systems will require rigorous verification and
validation. We propose testing in simulation using Coverage-Driven Verification
(CDV) to guide the testing process in an automatic and systematic way. We use a
two-tiered test generation approach, where abstract test sequences are computed
first and then concretized (e.g., data and variables are instantiated), to
reduce the complexity of the test generation problem. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, we developed a testbench for robotic code,
running in ROS-Gazebo, that implements an object handover as part of a
human-robot interaction (HRI) task. Tests are generated to stimulate the
robot's code in a realistic manner, through stimulating the human, environment,
sensors, and actuators in simulation. We compare the merits of unconstrained,
constrained and model-based test generation in achieving thorough exploration
of the code under test, and interesting combinations of human-robot
interactions. Our results show that CDV combined with systematic test
generation achieves a very high degree of automation in simulation-based
verification of control code for robots in HRI."
"Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of robots and in order to support
consensus and cooperation for multi-robot system, wireless communications and
networking among robots and the infrastructure have become indispensable. In
this technical note, we first provide an overview of the research contributions
on communication-aware motion planning (CAMP) in designing wireless-connected
robotic networks (WCRNs), where the degree-of-freedom (DoF) provided by motion
and communication capabilities embraced by the robots have not been fully
exploited. Therefore, we propose the framework of joint communication-motion
planning (JCMP) as well as the architecture for incorporating JCMP in WCRNs.
The proposed architecture is motivated by the observe-orient-decision-action
(OODA) model commonly adopted in robotic motion control and cognitive radio.
Then, we provide an overview of the orient module that quantify the
connectivity assessment. Afterwards, we highlight the JCMP module and compare
it with the conventional communication-planning, where the necessity of the
JCMP is validated via both theoretical analysis and simulation results of an
illustrative example. Finally, a series of open problems are discussed, which
picture the gap between the state-of-the-art and a practical WCRN."
"Multimodal tactile sensing could potentially enable robots to improve their
performance at manipulation tasks by rapidly discriminating between
task-relevant objects. Data-driven approaches to this tactile perception
problem show promise, but there is a dearth of suitable training data. In this
two-page paper, we present a portable handheld device for the efficient
acquisition of multimodal tactile sensing data from objects in their natural
settings, such as homes. The multimodal tactile sensor on the device integrates
a fabric-based force sensor, a contact microphone, an accelerometer,
temperature sensors, and a heating element. We briefly introduce our approach,
describe the device, and demonstrate feasibility through an evaluation with a
small data set that we captured by making contact with 7 task-relevant objects
in a bathroom of a person's home."
"Swarm robotics is a promising approach for the coordination of large numbers
of robots. While previous studies have shown that evolutionary robotics
techniques can be applied to obtain robust and efficient self-organized
behaviors for robot swarms, most studies have been conducted in simulation, and
the few that have been conducted on real robots have been confined to
laboratory environments. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a
swarm robotics system with evolved control successfully operating in a real and
uncontrolled environment. We evolve neural network-based controllers in
simulation for canonical swarm robotics tasks, namely homing, dispersion,
clustering, and monitoring. We then assess the performance of the controllers
on a real swarm of up to ten aquatic surface robots. Our results show that the
evolved controllers transfer successfully to real robots and achieve a
performance similar to the performance obtained in simulation. We validate that
the evolved controllers display key properties of swarm intelligence-based
control, namely scalability, flexibility, and robustness on the real swarm. We
conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in which the swarm performs a
complete environmental monitoring task by combining multiple evolved
controllers."
"We present a novel method to compute the approximate global penetration depth
(PD) between two non-convex geometric models. Our approach consists of two
phases: offline precomputation and run-time queries. In the first phase, our
formulation uses a novel sampling algorithm to precompute an approximation of
the high-dimensional contact space between the pair of models. As compared with
prior random sampling algorithms for contact space approximation, our
propagation sampling considerably speeds up the precomputation and yields a
high quality approximation. At run-time, we perform a nearest-neighbor query
and local projection to efficiently compute the translational or generalized
PD. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on complex 3D benchmarks
with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles, and we observe significant
improvement over previous methods in terms of accuracy, with a modest
improvement in the run-time performance."
"The Kilobot is a widely used platform for investigation of swarm robotics.
Physical Kilobots are slow moving and require frequent recalibration and
charging, which significantly slows down the development cycle. Simulators can
speed up the process of testing, exploring and hypothesis generation, but
usually require time consuming and error-prone translation of code between
simulator and robot. Moreover, code of different nature often obfuscates direct
comparison, as well as determination of the cause of deviation, between
simulator and actual robot swarm behaviour. To tackle these issues we have
developed a C-based simulator that allows those working with Kilobots to use
the same programme code in both the simulator and the physical robots. Use of
our simulator, coined Kilombo, significantly simplifies and speeds up
development, given that a simulation of 1000 robots can be run at a speed 100
times faster than real time on a desktop computer, making high-throughput
pre-screening possible of potential algorithms that could lead to desired
emergent behaviour. We argue that this strategy, here specifically developed
for Kilobots, is of general importance for effective robot swarm research. The
source code is freely available under the MIT license."
"Planning under process and measurement uncertainties is a challenging
problem. In its most general form it can be modeled as a Partially Observed
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. However POMDPs are generally difficult
to solve when the underlying spaces are continuous, particularly when beliefs
are non-Gaussian, and the difficulty is further exacerbated when there are also
non-convex constraints on states. Existing algorithms to address such
challenging POMDPs are expensive in terms of computation and memory. In this
paper, we provide a feedback policy in non-Gaussian belief space via solving a
convex program for common non-linear observation models. The solution involves
a Receding Horizon Control strategy using particle filters for the non-Gaussian
belief representation. We develop a way of capturing non-convex constraints in
the state space and adapt the optimization to incorporate such constraints, as
well. A key advantage of this method is that it does not introduce additional
variables in the optimization problem and is therefore more scalable than
existing constrained problems in belief space. We demonstrate the performance
of the method on different scenarios."
"Probabilistic completeness is an important property in motion planning.
Although it has been established with clear assumptions for geometric planners,
the panorama of completeness results for kinodynamic planners is still
incomplete, as most existing proofs rely on strong assumptions that are
difficult, if not impossible, to verify on practical systems. In this paper, we
focus on an important class of kinodynamic planners, namely those that
interpolate trajectories in the state space. We provide a proof of
probabilistic completeness for these planners under assumptions that can be
readily verified from the system's equations of motion and the user-defined
interpolation function. Our proof relies crucially on a property of
interpolated trajectories, termed second-order continuity (SOC), which we show
is tightly related to the ability of a planner to benefit from denser sampling.
We analyze the impact of this property in simulations on a low-torque pendulum.
Our results show that a simple RRT using a second-order continuous
interpolation swiftly finds solution, while it is impossible for the same
planner using standard Bezier curves (which are not SOC) to find any solution."
"This paper develops a comparative framework for the design of actuated
inertial appendages for planar, aerial reorientation. We define the Inertial
Reorientation template, the simplest model of this behavior, and leverage its
linear dynamics to reveal the design constraints linking a task with the body
designs capable of completing it. As practicable inertial appendage designs
lead to morphology that is generally more complex, we advance a notion of
""anchoring"" whereby a judicious choice of physical design in concert with an
appropriate control policy yields a system whose closed loop dynamics are
sufficiently captured by the template as to permit all further design to take
place in its far simpler parameter space. This approach is effective and
accurate over the diverse design spaces afforded by existing platforms,
enabling performance comparison through the shared task space. We analyze
examples from the literature and find advantages to each body type, but
conclude that tails provide the highest potential performance for reasonable
designs. Thus motivated, we build a physical example by retrofitting a tail to
a RHex robot and present empirical evidence of its efficacy."
"This paper focuses on the problem of supplying the workstations of assembly
lines with components during the production process. For that specific problem,
this paper presents a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that aims at
minimizing the energy consumption of the supplying strategy. More specifically,
in contrast of the usual formulations that only consider component flows, this
MILP handles the mass flow that are routed from one workstation to the other."
"This paper presents an anthropomorphic robotic bear for the exploration of
human-robot interaction including verbal and non-verbal communications. This
robot is implemented with a hybrid face composed of a mechanical faceplate with
10 DOFs and an LCD-display-equipped mouth. The facial emotions of the bear are
designed based on the description of the Facial Action Coding System as well as
some animal-like gestures described by Darwin. The mouth movements are realized
by synthesizing emotions with speech. User acceptance investigations have been
conducted to evaluate the likability of these facial behaviors exhibited by the
eBear. Multiple Kernel Learning is proposed to fuse different features for
recognizing user's facial expressions. Our experimental results show that the
developed Bear-Like robot can perceive basic facial expressions and provide
emotive conveyance towards human beings."
"This article proposes an emotive lifelike robotic face, called ExpressionBot,
that is designed to support verbal and non-verbal communication between the
robot and humans, with the goal of closely modeling the dynamics of natural
face-to-face communication. The proposed robotic head consists of two major
components: 1) a hardware component that contains a small projector, a fish-eye
lens, a custom-designed mask and a neck system with 3 degrees of freedom; 2) a
facial animation system, projected onto the robotic mask, that is capable of
presenting facial expressions, realistic eye movement, and accurate visual
speech. We present three studies that compare Human-Robot Interaction with
Human-Computer Interaction with a screen-based model of the avatar. The studies
indicate that the robotic face is well accepted by users, with some advantages
in recognition of facial expression and mutual eye gaze contact."
"We present a highly functional and cost-effective prosthesis for transfemoral
amputees that uses series elastic actuators. These actuators allow for accurate
force control, low impedance and large dynamic range. The design involves one
active joint at the knee and a passive joint at the ankle. Additionally, the
socket was designed using mirroring of compliances to ensure maximum comfort."
"Purpose. To obtain the interference immunity of the data exchange by spread
spectrum signals with variable entropy of the telemetric information data
exchange with autonomous mobile robots.
  Methodology. The results have been obtained by the theoretical investigations
and have been confirmed by the modeling experiments.
  Findings. The interference immunity in form of dependence of bit error
probability on normalized signal/noise ratio of the data exchange by spread
spectrum signals with variable entropy has been obtained.It has been proved
that the interference immunity factor (needed normalized signal/noise ratio) is
at least 2 dB better under condition of equal time complexity as compared with
correlation processing methods of orthogonal signals.
  Originality. For the first time the interference immunity in form of
dependence of bit error probability on normalized signal/noise ratio of the
data exchange by spread spectrum signals with variable entropy has been
obtained.
  Practical value. The obtained results prove the feasibility of using variable
entropy spread spectrum signals data exchange method in the distributed
telemetric information processing systems in specific circumstances."
"Current approaches for visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain
highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time
optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this
problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at
high rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the
optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial
measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion
constraints. Our first contribution is a \emph{preintegration theory} that
properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally
discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation
noise and derive the expression for the \emph{maximum a posteriori} state
estimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary
Jacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic
form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can
be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying
framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of
incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \emph{structureless} model
for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further
accelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our
monocular \VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm
that our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches."
"Industrial robust controlling systems built using automated guided vehicles
(AGVs) requires planning which depends on cost parameters like time and energy
of the mobile robots functioning in the system. This work addresses the problem
of on-line traversal time identification and estimation for proper mobility of
mobile robots on systems' traffic networks. Several filtering and estimation
methods have been investigated with respect to proper identification of
traversal time of arcs of systems' transportation graphs. We have found that
traversal times vary along time due to a variety of factors, including the
battery charge of the robot, and that the best method to predict the next value
must account not only for these but for a high variance. Results show that path
planning and navigation for each of the mobile robots can be made much more
efficient with this approach."
"This research proposes new tools for investigation of behavioral diversity in
multi-robot systems and a significant body of results using these tools in
simulated and real mobile robot experiments. The experiments specifically
describe a framework of defining behavior-based strategies for multi-robot
tasks as robot foraging, robot soccer and robot formation. The research focuses
specifically on motor schema-based multi-robot systems, which are an important
example of behavior-based control."
"This work introduces a novel technique for fabricating functional robots
using 3D printers. Simultaneously depositing photopolymers and a non-curing
liquid allows complex, pre-filled fluidic channels to be fabricated. This new
printing capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and robotic
components to be automatically built, with no assembly required. The technique
is showcased by printing linear bellows actuators, gear pumps, soft grippers
and a hexapod robot, using a commercially-available 3D printer. We detail the
steps required to modify the printer and describe the design constraints
imposed by this new fabrication approach."
"Mobile robots are becoming part of our every day living at home, work or
entertainment. Due to their limited power capabilities, the development of new
energy consumption models can lead to energy conservation and energy efficient
designs. In this paper, we carry out a number of experiments and we focus on
the motors power consumption of a specific robot called Wifibot. Based on the
experimentation results, we build models for different speed and acceleration
levels. We compare the motors power consumption to other robot running modes.
We, also, create a simple robot network scenario and we investigate whether
forwarding data through a closer node could lead to longer operation times. We
assess the effect energy capacity, traveling distance and data rate on the
operation time."
"Pick-and-place regrasp is an important manipulation skill for a robot. It
helps a robot accomplish tasks that cannot be achieved within a single grasp,
due to constraints such as kinematics or collisions between the robot and the
environment. Previous work on pick-and-place regrasp only leveraged flat
surfaces for intermediate placements, and thus is limited in the capability to
reorient an object.
  In this paper, we extend the reorientation capability of a pick-and-place
regrasp by adding a vertical pin on the working surface and using it as the
intermediate location for regrasping. In particular, our method automatically
computes the stable placements of an object leaning against a vertical pin,
finds several force-closure grasps, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and
searches for the regrasp sequence. To compare the regrasping performance with
and without using pins, we evaluate the success rate and the length of regrasp
sequences while performing tasks on various models. Experiments on
reorientation and assembly tasks validate the benefit of using support pins for
regrasping."
"Robotic manipulation of deformable objects remains a challenging task. One
such task is folding a garment autonomously. Given start and end folding
positions, what is an optimal trajectory to move the robotic arm to fold a
garment? Certain trajectories will cause the garment to move, creating
wrinkles, and gaps, other trajectories will fail altogether. We present a novel
solution to find an optimal trajectory that avoids such problematic scenarios.
The trajectory is optimized by minimizing a quadratic objective function in an
off-line simulator, which includes material properties of the garment and
frictional force on the table. The function measures the dissimilarity between
a user folded shape and the folded garment in simulation, which is then used as
an error measurement to create an optimal trajectory. We demonstrate that our
two-arm robot can follow the optimized trajectories, achieving accurate and
efficient manipulations of deformable objects."
"This paper solves the classical problem of simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) in a fashion which avoids linearized approximations altogether.
Based on creating virtual synthetic measurements, the algorithm uses a linear
time- varying (LTV) Kalman observer, bypassing errors and approximations
brought by the linearization process in traditional extended Kalman filtering
(EKF) SLAM. Convergence rates of the algorithm are established using
contraction analysis. Different combinations of sensor information can be
exploited, such as bearing measurements, range measurements, optical flow, or
time-to-contact. As illustrated in simulations, the proposed algorithm can
solve SLAM problems in both 2D and 3D scenarios with guaranteed convergence
rates in a full nonlinear context."
"We present a general framework to autonomously achieve a task, where autonomy
is acquired by learning sensorimotor patterns of a robot, while it is
interacting with its environment. To accomplish the task, using the learned
sensorimotor contingencies, our approach predicts a sequence of actions that
will lead to the desirable observations. Gaussian processes (GP) with automatic
relevance determination is used to learn the sensorimotor mapping. In this way,
relevant sensory and motor components can be systematically found in
high-dimensional sensory and motor spaces. We propose an incremental GP
learning strategy, which discerns between situations, when an update or an
adaptation must be implemented. RRT* is exploited to enable long-term planning
and generating a sequence of states that lead to a given goal; while a
gradient-based search finds the optimum action to steer to a neighbouring state
in a single time step. Our experimental results prove the successfulness of the
proposed framework to learn a joint space controller with high data dimensions
(10$\times$15). It demonstrates short training phase (less than 12 seconds),
real-time performance and rapid adaptations capabilities."
"The Sixth International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and Models for
Robotic Systems (DSLRob'15) was held September 28, 2015 in Hamburg (Germany),
as part of the IROS 2015 conference. The main topics of the workshop were
Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and Model-driven Software Development (MDSD)
for robotics. A domain-specific language is a programming language dedicated to
a particular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions
that increase programmer productivity within that domain. Model-driven software
development offers a high-level way for domain users to specify the
functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction. DSLs and
models have historically been used for programming complex systems. However
recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study. Robotic
systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises
many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time constraints, ...),
for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages often lead to a poor
fit between the language features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and
models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the
programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel software solutions to
complex problems within the robotics domain."
"With 3D sensing becoming cheaper, environment-aware and visually-guided robot
arms capable of safely working in collaboration with humans will become common.
However, a reliable calibration is needed, both for camera internal
calibration, as well as Eye-to-Hand calibration, to make sure the whole system
functions correctly. We present a framework, using a novel combination of well
proven methods, allowing a quick automatic calibration for the integration of
systems consisting of the robot and a varying number of 3D cameras by using a
standard checkerboard calibration grid. Our approach allows a quick
camera-to-robot recalibration after any changes to the setup, for example when
cameras or robot have been repositioned. Modular design of the system ensures
flexibility regarding a number of sensors used as well as different hardware
choices. The framework has been proven to work by practical experiments to
analyze the quality of the calibration versus the number of positions of the
checkerboard used for each of the calibration procedures."
"This paper presents an estimation and control algorithm for an aerial
manipulator using a hexacopter with a 2-DOF robotic arm. The unknown parameters
of a payload are estimated by an on-line estimator based on parametrization of
the aerial manipulator dynamics. With the estimated mass information and the
augmented passivity-based controller, the aerial manipulator can fly with the
unknown object. Simulation for an aerial manipulator is performed to compare
estimation performance between the proposed control algorithm and conventional
adaptive sliding mode controller. Experimental results show a successful flight
of a custom-made aerial manipulator while the unknown parameters related to an
additional payload were estimated satisfactorily."
"We introduce a functional gradient descent trajectory optimization algorithm
for robot motion planning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).
Functional gradient algorithms are a popular choice for motion planning in
complex many-degree-of-freedom robots, since they (in theory) work by directly
optimizing within a space of continuous trajectories to avoid obstacles while
maintaining geometric properties such as smoothness. However, in practice,
functional gradient algorithms typically commit to a fixed, finite
parameterization of trajectories, often as a list of waypoints. Such a
parameterization can lose much of the benefit of reasoning in a continuous
trajectory space: e.g., it can require taking an inconveniently small step size
and large number of iterations to maintain smoothness. Our work generalizes
functional gradient trajectory optimization by formulating it as minimization
of a cost functional in an RKHS. This generalization lets us represent
trajectories as linear combinations of kernel functions, without any need for
waypoints. As a result, we are able to take larger steps and achieve a locally
optimal trajectory in just a few iterations. Depending on the selection of
kernel, we can directly optimize in spaces of trajectories that are inherently
smooth in velocity, jerk, curvature, etc., and that have a low-dimensional,
adaptively chosen parameterization. Our experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of the planner for different kernels, including Gaussian RBFs,
Laplacian RBFs, and B-splines, as compared to the standard discretized waypoint
representation."
"In this paper, we propose several solutions to guide an older adult along a
safe path using a robotic walking assistant (the c-Walker). We consider four
different possibilities to execute the task. One of them is mechanical, with
the c-Walker playing an active role in setting the course. The other ones are
based on tactile or acoustic stimuli, and suggest a direction of motion that
the user is supposed to take on her own will. We describe the technological
basis for the hardware components implementing the different solutions, and
show specialized path following algorithms for each of them. The paper reports
an extensive user validation activity with a quantitative and qualitative
analysis of the different solutions. In this work, we test our system just with
young participants to establish a safer methodology that will be used in future
studies with older adults."
"In this paper we explore state-of-the-art underactuated, compliant robot
gripper designs through looking at their performance on a generic grasping
task. Starting from a state of the art open gripper design, we propose design
modifications,and importantly, evaluate all designs on a grasping experiment
involving a selection of objects resulting in 3600 object-gripper interactions.
Interested in non-planned grasping but rather on a design's generic
performance, we explore the influence of object shape, pose and orientation
relative to the gripper and its finger number and configuration. Using
open-loop grasps we achieved up to 75% success rate over our trials. The
results indicate and support that under motion constraints and uncertainties
and without involving grasp planning, a 2-fingered underactuated compliant hand
outperforms higher multi-fingered configurations. To our knowledge this is the
first extended objective comparison of various multi-fingered underactuated
hand designs under generic grasping conditions."
"This paper summarizes lessons learned from the first Amazon Picking Challenge
in which 26 international teams designed robotic systems that competed to
retrieve items from warehouse shelves. This task is currently performed by
human workers, and there is hope that robots can someday help increase
efficiency and throughput while lowering cost. We report on a 28-question
survey posed to the teams to learn about each team's background, mechanism
design, perception apparatus, planning and control approach. We identify trends
in this data, correlate it with each team's success in the competition, and
discuss observations and lessons learned."
"This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a tele-presence
wheelchair system based on tele-presence robot, intelligent wheelchair, and
touch screen technologies. The tele-presence wheelchair system consists of a
commercial electric wheelchair, an add-on tele-presence interaction module, and
a touchable live video image based user interface (called TIUI). The
tele-presence interaction module is used to provide video-chatting for an
elderly or disabled person with the family members or caregivers, and also
captures the live video of an environment for tele-operation and
semi-autonomous navigation. The user interface developed in our lab allows an
operator to access the system anywhere and directly touch the live video image
of the wheelchair to push it as if he/she did it in the presence. This paper
also discusses the evaluation of the user experience."
"Motion planning under differential constraints, kinodynamic motion planning,
is one of the canonical problems in robotics. Currently, state-of-the-art
methods evolve around kinodynamic variants of popular sampling-based
algorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs). However, there are
still challenges remaining, for example, how to include complex dynamics while
guaranteeing optimality. If the open-loop dynamics are unstable, exploration by
random sampling in control space becomes inefficient. We describe a new
sampling-based algorithm, called CL-RRT#, which leverages ideas from the RRT#
algorithm and a variant of the RRT algorithm that generates trajectories using
closed-loop prediction. The idea of planning with closed-loop prediction allows
us to handle complex unstable dynamics and avoids the need to find
computationally hard steering procedures. The search technique presented in the
RRT# algorithm allows us to improve the solution quality by searching over
alternative reference trajectories. Numerical simulations using a nonholonomic
system demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach."
"The motivation of this paper is to develop a smart system using multi-modal
vision for next-generation mechanical assembly. It includes two phases where in
the first phase human beings teach the assembly structure to a robot and in the
second phase the robot finds objects and grasps and assembles them using AI
planning. The crucial part of the system is the precision of 3D visual
detection and the paper presents multi-modal approaches to meet the
requirements: AR markers are used in the teaching phase since human beings can
actively control the process. Point cloud matching and geometric constraints
are used in the robot execution phase to avoid unexpected noises. Experiments
are performed to examine the precision and correctness of the approaches. The
study is practical: The developed approaches are integrated with graph
model-based motion planning, implemented on an industrial robots and applicable
to real-world scenarios."
"Capturability of a robot determines whether it is able to capture a robot
within a number of steps. Current capturability analysis is based on stance leg
dynamics, without taking adequate consideration on swing leg. In this paper, we
combine capturability-based analysis with swing leg dynamics. We first
associate original definition of capturability with a time-margin, which
encodes a time sequence that can capture the robot. This time-margin
capturability requires consideration of swing leg, and we therefore introduce a
swing leg kernel that acts as a bridge between step time and step length. We
analyze N-step capturability with a combined model of swing leg kernels and a
linear inverted pendulum model. By analyzing swing leg kernels with different
parameters, we find that more powerful actuation and longer normalized step
length result in greater capturability. We also answer the question whether
more steps would give greater capturability. For a given disturbance, we find a
step sequence that minimizes actuation. This step sequence is whether a step
time sequence or a step length sequence, and this classification is based on
boundary value problem analysis."
"The semantic localization problem in robotics consists in determining the
place where a robot is located by means of semantic categories. The problem is
usually addressed as a supervised classification process, where input data
correspond to robot perceptions while classes to semantic categories, like
kitchen or corridor.
  In this paper we propose a framework, implemented in the PCL library, which
provides a set of valuable tools to easily develop and evaluate semantic
localization systems. The implementation includes the generation of 3D global
descriptors following a Bag-of-Words approach. This allows the generation of
dimensionality-fixed descriptors from any type of keypoint detector and feature
extractor combinations. The framework has been designed, structured and
implemented in order to be easily extended with different keypoint detectors,
feature extractors as well as classification models.
  The proposed framework has also been used to evaluate the performance of a
set of already implemented descriptors, when used as input for a specific
semantic localization system. The results obtained are discussed paying special
attention to the internal parameters of the BoW descriptor generation process.
Moreover, we also review the combination of some keypoint detectors with
different 3D descriptor generation techniques."
"The problem of developing distributed control and navigation system for
quadrotor UAVs operating in GPS-denied environments is addressed in the paper.
Cooperative navigation, marker detection and mapping task solved by a team of
multiple unmanned aerial vehicles is chosen as demo example. Developed
intelligent control system complies with on 4D\RCS reference model and its
implementation is based on ROS framework. Custom implementation of EKF-based
map building algorithm is used to solve marker detection and map building task."

"We consider the problem of configuration formation in modular robot systems
where a set of modules that are initially in different configurations and
located at different locations are required to assume appropriate positions so
that they can get into a new, user-specified, target configuration. We propose
a novel algorithm based on graph isomorphism, where the modules select
locations or spots in the target configuration using a utility-based framework,
while retaining their original configuration to the greatest extent possible,
to reduce the time and energy required by the modules to assume the target
configuration. We have shown analytically that our proposed algorithm is
complete and guarantees a Pareto-optimal allocation. Experimental simulations
of our algorithm with different number of modules in different initial
configurations and located initially at different locations, show that the
planning time of our algorithm is nominal (order of msec. for 100 modules). We
have also compared our algorithm against a market-based allocation algorithm
and shown that our proposed algorithm performs better in terms of time and
number of messages exchanged."
"New safety critical systems are about to appear in our everyday life:
advanced robots able to interact with humans and perform tasks at home, in
hospitals , or at work. A hazardous behavior of those systems, induced by
failures or extreme environment conditions, may lead to catastrophic
consequences. Well-known risk analysis methods used in other critical domains
(e.g., avion-ics, nuclear, medical, transportation), have to be extended or
adapted due to the non-deterministic behavior of those systems, evolving in
unstructured environments. One major challenge is thus to develop methods that
can be applied at the very beginning of the development process, to identify
hazards induced by robot tasks and their interactions with humans. In this
paper we present a method which is based on an adaptation of a hazard
identification technique, HAZOP (Hazard Operability), coupled with a system
description notation, UML (Unified Modeling Language). This systematic approach
has been applied successfully in research projects, and is now applied by robot
manufacturers. Some results of those studies are presented and discussed to
explain the benefits and limits of our method."
"This paper presents a first contribution to the design of a small aerial
robot for inhabited microgravity environments, such as orbiting space stations.
In particular, we target a fleet of robots for collaborative tasks with humans,
such as telepresence and cooperative mobile manipulation. We explore a
propeller based propulsion system, arranged in such a way that the
translational and the rotational components can be decoupled, resulting in an
holonomic hexarotor. Since propellers have limited thrust, we employ an
optimization approach to select the geometric configuration given a criteria of
uniform maximum thrust across all directions in the body reference frame. We
also tackle the problem of motion control: due to the decoupling of
translational and rotational modes we use separate converging controllers for
each one of these modes. In addition, we present preliminary simulation results
in a realistic simulator, in closed loop with the proposed controller, thus
providing a first validation of the followed methodology."
"We describe an algorithm for motion planning based on expert demonstrations
of a skill. In order to teach robots to perform complex object manipulation
tasks that can generalize robustly to new environments, we must (1) learn a
representation of the effects of a task and (2) find an optimal trajectory that
will reproduce these effects in a new environment. We represent robot skills in
terms of a probability distribution over features learned from multiple expert
demonstrations. When utilizing a skill in a new environment, we compute feature
expectations over trajectory samples in order to stochastically optimize the
likelihood of a trajectory in the new environment. The purpose of this method
is to enable execution of complex tasks based on a library of probabilistic
skill models. Motions can be combined to accomplish complex tasks in hybrid
domains. Our approach is validated in a variety of case studies, including an
Android game, simulated assembly task, and real robot experiment with a UR5."
"Safely integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into civil airspace is contingent
upon development of a trustworthy collision avoidance system. This paper
proposes an approach whereby a parameterized resolution logic that is
considered trusted for a given range of its parameters is adaptively tuned
online. Specifically, to address the potential conservatism of the resolution
logic with static parameters, we present a dynamic programming approach for
adapting the parameters dynamically based on the encounter state. We compute
the adaptation policy offline using a simulation-based approximate dynamic
programming method that accommodates the high dimensionality of the problem.
Numerical experiments show that this approach improves safety and operational
performance compared to the baseline resolution logic, while retaining
trustworthiness."
"Robotic manipulation of deformable objects remains a challenging task. One
such task is to iron a piece of cloth autonomously. Given a roughly flattened
cloth, the goal is to have an ironing plan that can iteratively apply a regular
iron to remove all the major wrinkles by a robot. We present a novel solution
to analyze the cloth surface by fusing two surface scan techniques: a curvature
scan and a discontinuity scan. The curvature scan can estimate the height
deviation of the cloth surface, while the discontinuity scan can effectively
detect sharp surface features, such as wrinkles. We use this information to
detect the regions that need to be pulled and extended before ironing, and the
other regions where we want to detect wrinkles and apply ironing to remove the
wrinkles. We demonstrate that our hybrid scan technique is able to capture and
classify wrinkles over the surface robustly. Given detected wrinkles, we enable
a robot to iron them using shape features. Experimental results show that using
our wrinkle analysis algorithm, our robot is able to iron the cloth surface and
effectively remove the wrinkles."
"This work presents methods for the determination of a humanoid robot's joint
velocities and accelerations directly from link-mounted Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) each containing a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis
accelerometer. No information about the global pose of the floating base or its
links is required and precise knowledge of the link IMU poses is not necessary
due to presented calibration routines. Additionally, a filter is introduced to
fuse gyroscope angular velocities with joint position measurements and
compensate the computed joint velocities for time-varying gyroscope biases. The
resulting joint velocities are subject to less noise and delay than filtered
velocities computed from numerical differentiation of joint potentiometer
signals, leading to superior performance in joint feedback control as
demonstrated in experiments performed on a SARCOS hydraulic humanoid."

"The Memory-Centred Cognition perspective places an active association
substrate at the heart of cognition, rather than as a passive adjunct.
Consequently, it places prediction and priming on the basis of prior experience
to be inherent and fundamental aspects of processing. Social interaction is
taken here to minimally require contingent and co-adaptive behaviours from the
interacting parties. In this contribution, I seek to show how the
memory-centred cognition approach to cognitive architectures can provide an
means of addressing these functions. A number of example implementations are
briefly reviewed, particularly focusing on multi-modal alignment as a function
of experience-based priming. While there is further refinement required to the
theory, and implementations based thereon, this approach provides an
interesting alternative perspective on the foundations of cognitive
architectures to support robots engage in social interactions with humans."
"We propose a polynomial force-motion model for planar sliding. The set of
generalized friction loads is the 1-sublevel set of a polynomial whose gradient
directions correspond to generalized velocities. Additionally, the polynomial
is confined to be convex even-degree homogeneous in order to obey the maximum
work inequality, symmetry, shape invariance in scale, and fast invertibility.
We present a simple and statistically-efficient model identification procedure
using a sum-of-squares convex relaxation. Simulation and robotic experiments
validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. We also show practical
applications of our model including stable pushing of objects and free sliding
dynamic simulations."
"In this paper a cascaded approach for stabilization and path tracking of a
general 2-trailer vehicle configuration with an off-axle hitching is presented.
A low level Linear Quadratic controller is used for stabilization of the
internal angles while a pure pursuit path tracking controller is used on a
higher level to handle the path tracking. Piecewise linearity is the only
requirement on the control reference which makes the design of reference paths
very general. A Graphical User Interface is designed to make it easy for a user
to design control references for complex manoeuvres given some representation
of the surroundings. The approach is demonstrated with challenging path
following scenarios both in simulation and on a small scale test platform."
"The use of robotics in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) is growing steadily
from their initial inception during the 2001 World Trade Centre incident.
Despite years of progress, the core design of robots currently in use for USAR
purposes has deviated little, favoring software and control development and
optimization of the basic robot template to improve performance instead.
Presented here is a novel design description of the Cricket, an advanced robot
with a broader range of physical capabilities than traditional USAR robots. By
incorporating the tracked structure of earlier robots, appreciated for energy
efficiency and robustness, into a multi-limbed walking design, the Cricket
enables the use of advanced locomotion techniques. The ability to climb over
obstacles many times the height of the robot, ascend vertical shafts without
the assistance of a tether, and traverse rough and near vertical terrain
improves the Cricket's capability to successfully locate victims in confined
spaces."
"Robotic architectures that incorporate cloud-based resources are just now
gaining popularity. However, researchers have very few investigations into
their capabilities to support claims of their feasibility. We propose a novel
method to exchange quality for speed of response. Further, we back this
assertion with empirical findings from experiments performed with Amazon
Mechanical Turk and find that our method improves quality in exchange for
response time in our cognitive architecture."
"In this position paper, we discuss how the use of a cognitive architecture
based on unsupervised clustering (the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map) enables us
to meet our goals of efficient action selection in a mobile robot. This
architecture provides several opportunities for human-robot interaction, and we
discuss how its features facilitate these interactions."
"We show a control algorithm to guide a robotic walking assistant along a
planned path. The control strategy exploits the electromechanical brakes
mounted on the back wheels of the walker. In order to reduce the hardware
requirements we adopt a Bang Bang approach relying of four actions (with
saturated value for the braking torques).When the platform is far away from the
path, we execute an approach phase in which the walker converges toward the
platform with a specified angle. When it comes in proximity of the platform,
the control strategy switches to a path tracking mode, which uses the four
control actions to converge toward the path with an angle which is a function
of the state. This way it is possible to control the vehicle in feedback,
secure a gentle convergence of the user to the planned path and her steady
progress towards the destination."
"The topic of joint actions has been deeply studied in the context of
Human-Human interaction in order to understand how humans cooperate. Creating
autonomous robots that collaborate with humans is a complex problem, where it
is relevant to apply what has been learned in the context of Human-Human
interaction. The question is what skills to implement and how to integrate them
in order to build a cognitive architecture, allowing a robot to collaborate
efficiently and naturally with humans. In this paper, we first list a set of
skills that we consider essential for Joint Action, then we analyze the problem
from the robot's point of view and discuss how they can be instantiated in
human-robot scenarios. Finally, we open the discussion on how to integrate such

"The StarL programming framework aims to simplify development of distributed
robotic applications by providing easy-to-use language constructs for
communication and control. It has been used to develop applications such as
formation control, distributed tracking, and collaborative search. In this
paper, we present a complete redesign of the StarL language and its runtime
system which enables us to achieve portability of robot programs across
platforms. Thus, the same application program, say, for distributed tracking,
can now be compiled and deployed on multiple, heterogeneous robotic platforms.
Towards portability, this we first define the semantics of StarL programs in a
way that is largely platform independent, except for a few key
platform-dependent parameters that capture the worst-case execution and sensing
delays and resolution of sensors. Next, we present a design of the StarL
runtime system, including a robot controller, that meets the above semantics.
The controller consists of a platform-independent path planner implemented
using RRTs and a platform-dependent way-point tracker that is implemented using
the control commands available for the platform. We demonstrate portability of
StarL applications using simulation results for two different robotic
platforms, and several applications."
"We present a damage-aware planning approach which determines the best
sequence to manipulate a number of objects in a scene. This works on
task-planning level, abstracts from motion planning and anticipates the
dynamics of the scene using a physics simulation. Instead of avoiding
interaction with the environment, we take unintended motion of other objects
into account and plan manipulation sequences which minimize the potential
damage. Our method can also be used as a validation measure to judge planned
motions for their feasibility in terms of damage avoidance. We evaluate our
approach on one industrial scenario (autonomous container unloading) and one
retail scenario (shelf replenishment)."
"The software of robotic assistants needs to be verified, to ensure its safety
and functional correctness. Testing in simulation allows a high degree of
realism in the verification. However, generating tests that cover both
interesting foreseen and unforeseen scenarios in human-robot interaction (HRI)
tasks, while executing most of the code, remains a challenge. We propose the
use of belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents in the test environment, to
increase the level of realism and human-like stimulation of simulated robots.
Artificial intelligence, such as agent theory, can be exploited for more
intelligent test generation. An automated testbench was implemented for a
simulation in Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo, of a cooperative table
assembly task between a humanoid robot and a person. Requirements were verified
for this task, and some unexpected design issues were discovered, leading to
possible code improvements. Our results highlight the practicality of BDI
agents to automatically generate valid and human-like tests to get high code
coverage, compared to hand-written directed tests, pseudorandom generation, and
other variants of model-based test generation. Also, BDI agents allow the
coverage of combined behaviours of the HRI system with more ease than writing
temporal logic properties for model checking."
"We present a framework to generate watertight mesh representations in an
unsupervised manner from noisy point clouds of complex, heterogeneous objects
with free-form surfaces. The resulting meshes are ready to use in applications
like kinematics and dynamics simulation where watertightness and fast
processing are the main quality criteria. This works with no necessity of user
interaction, mainly by utilizing a modified Growing Neural Gas technique for
surface reconstruction combined with several post-processing steps. In contrast
to existing methods, the proposed framework is able to cope with input point
clouds generated by consumer-grade RGBD sensors and works even if the input
data features large holes, e.g. a missing bottom which was not covered by the
sensor. Additionally, we explain a method to unsupervisedly optimize the
parameters of our framework in order to improve generalization quality and, at
the same time, keep the resulting meshes as coherent as possible to the
original object regarding visual and geometric properties."
"In complex manipulation scenarios (e.g. tasks requiring complex interaction
of two hands or in-hand manipulation), generaliza- tion is a hard problem.
Current methods still either require a substantial amount of (supervised)
training data and / or strong assumptions on both the environment and the task.
In this paradigm, controllers solving these tasks tend to be complex. We
propose a paradigm of maintaining simpler controllers solving the task in a
small number of specific situations. In order to generalize to novel
situations, the robot transforms the environment from novel situations to a
situation where the solution of the task is already known. Our solution to this
problem is to play with objects and use previously trained skills (basis
skills). These skills can either be used for estimating or for changing the
current state of the environment and are organized in skill hierarchies. The
approach is evaluated in complex pick-and-place scenarios that involve complex
manipulation. We further show that these skills can be learned by autonomous
playing."
"Change detection, i.e., anomaly detection from local maps built by a mobile
robot at multiple different times, is a challenging problem to solve in
practice. Most previous work either cannot be applied to scenarios where the
size of the map collection is large, or simply assumed that the robot
self-location is globally known. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
simultaneous self-localization and change detection, by reformulating the
problem as a map retrieval problem, and propose a local map descriptor with a
compressed bag-of-words (BoW) structure as a scalable solution. We make the
following contributions. (1) To enable a direct comparison of the spatial
layout of visual features between different local maps, the origin of the local
map coordinate (termed ""viewpoint"") is planned by scene parsing and determined
by our ""viewpoint planner"" to be invariant against small variations in
self-location and changes, aiming at providing similar viewpoints for similar
scenes (i.e., the relevant map pair). (2) We extend the BoW model to enable the
use of not only the appearance (e.g., polestar) but also the spatial layout
(e.g., spatial pyramid) of visual features with respect to the planned
viewpoint. The key observation is that the planned viewpoint (i.e., the origin
of local map coordinate) acts as a pseudo viewpoint that is usually required by
spatial BoW (e.g., SPM) and also by anomaly detection (e.g., NN-d, LOF). (3)
Experimental results on a challenging ""loop-closing"" scenario show that the
proposed method outperforms previous BoW methods in self-localization, and
furthermore, that the use of both appearance and pose information in change
detection produces better results than the use of either information alone."
"The widespread adoption of autonomous systems depends on providing guarantees
of safety and functional correctness, at both design time and runtime.
Information about the extent to which functional requirements can be met in
combination with non-functional requirements (NFRs) -- i.e. requirements that
can be partially complied with -- , under dynamic and uncertain environments,
provides opportunities to enhance the safety and functional correctness of
systems at design time. We present a technique to formally define system
attributes that can change or be changed to deal with dynamic and uncertain
environments (denominated weakened specifications) as a partially ordered
lattice, and to automatically explore the system under different
specifications, using probabilistic model checking, to find the likelihood of
satisfying a requirement. The resulting probabilities form boundaries of
""optimal specifications"", analogous to Pareto frontiers in multi-objective
optimization, informing the designer about the system's capabilities, such as
resilience or robustness, when changing its attributes to deal with dynamic and
uncertain environments. We illustrate the proposed technique through a domestic
robotic assistant example."
"With the advance in robotic hardware and intelligent software, humanoid robot
plays an important role in various tasks including service for human assistance
and heavy job for hazardous industry. Recent advances in task learning enable
humanoid robots to conduct dexterous manipulation tasks such as grasping
objects and assembling parts of furniture. Operating objects without physical
movements is an even more challenging task for humanoid robot because effects
of actions may not be clearly seen in the physical configuration space and
meaningful actions could be very complex in a long time horizon. As an example,
playing a mobile game in a smart device has such challenges because both swipe
actions and complex state transitions inside the smart devices in a long time
horizon. In this paper, we solve this problem by introducing an integrated
architecture which connects end-to-end dataflow from sensors to actuators in a
humanoid robot to operate smart devices. We implement our integrated
architecture in the Baxter Research Robot and experimentally demonstrate that
the robot with our architecture could play a challenging mobile game, the 2048
game, as accurate as in a simulated environment."
"Whole body tactile perception via tactile skins offers large benefits for
robots in unstructured environments. To fully realize this benefit, tactile
systems must support real-time data acquisition over a massive number of
tactile sensor elements. We present a novel approach for scalable tactile data
acquisition using compressed sensing. We first demonstrate that the tactile
data is amenable to compressed sensing techniques. We then develop a solution
for fast data sampling, compression, and reconstruction that is suited for
tactile system hardware and has potential for reducing the wiring complexity.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of our technique on simulated tactile
sensor networks. Our evaluations show that compressed sensing, with a
compression ratio of 3 to 1, can achieve higher signal acquisition accuracy
than full data acquisition of noisy sensor data."
"This paper considers the problem of grasp pose detection in point clouds. We
follow a general algorithmic structure that first generates a large set of
6-DOF grasp candidates and then classifies each of them as a good or a bad
grasp. Our focus in this paper is on improving the second step by using depth
sensor scans from large online datasets to train a convolutional neural
network. We propose two new representations of grasp candidates, and we
quantify the effect of using prior knowledge of two forms: instance or category
knowledge of the object to be grasped, and pretraining the network on simulated
depth data obtained from idealized CAD models. Our analysis shows that a more
informative grasp candidate representation as well as pretraining and prior
knowledge significantly improve grasp detection. We evaluate our approach on a
Baxter Research Robot and demonstrate an average grasp success rate of 93% in
dense clutter. This is a 20% improvement compared to our prior work."
"We present an optimization-based motion planning algorithm to compute a
smooth, collision-free trajectory for a manipulator used to transfer a liquid
from a source to a target container. We take into account fluid dynamics
constraints as part of trajectory computation. In order to avoid the high
complexity of exact fluid simulation, we introduce a simplified dynamics model
based on physically inspired approximations and system identification. Our
optimization approach can incorporate various other constraints such as
collision avoidance with the obstacles, kinematic and dynamics constraints of
the manipulator, and fluid dynamics characteristics. We demonstrate the
performance of our planner on different benchmarks corresponding to various
obstacles and container shapes. Furthermore, we also evaluate its accuracy by
validating the motion plan using an accurate but computationally costly
Navier-Stokes fluid simulation."
"In recent years, the interdisciplinary research between information science
and neuroscience has been a hotspot. In this paper, based on recent biological
findings, we proposed a new model to mimic visual information processing, motor
planning and control in central and peripheral nervous systems of human. Main
steps of the model are as follows: 1) Simulating ""where"" pathway in human: the
Selective Search method is applied to simulate the function of human dorsal
visual pathway to localize object candidates; 2) Simulating ""what"" pathway in
human: a Convolutional Deep Belief Network is applied to simulate the
hierarchical structure and function of human ventral visual pathway for object
recognition; 3) Simulating motor planning process in human: habitual motion
planning process in human is simulated, and motor commands are generated from
the combination of control signals from past experiences; 4) Simulating precise
movement control in human: calibrated control signals, which mimic the
adjustment for movement from cerebellum in human, are generated and updated
from calibration of movement errors in past experiences, and sent to the
movement model to achieve high precision. The proposed framework mimics
structures and functions of human recognition, visuomotor coordination and
precise motor control. Experiments on object localization, recognition and
movement control demonstrate that the new proposed model can not only
accomplish visuomotor coordination tasks, but also achieve high precision
movement with learning ability. Meanwhile, the results also prove the validity
of the introduced mechanisms. Furthermore, the proposed model could be
generalized and applied to other systems, such as mechanical and electrical
systems in robotics, to achieve fast response, high precision movement with
learning ability."
"In this paper, we describe an algorithm, based on the well-known Unscented
Quaternion Estimator, to estimate external forces and torques acting on a
quadrotor. This formulation uses a non-linear model for the quadrotor dynamics,
naturally incorporates process and measurement noise, requires only a few
parameters to be tuned manually, and uses singularity-free unit quaternions to
represent attitude. We demonstrate in simulation that the proposed algorithm
can outperform existing methods. We then highlight how our approach can be used
to generate force and torque profiles from experimental data, and how this
information can later be used for controller design. Finally, we show how the
resulting controllers enable a quadrotor to stay in the wind field of a moving
fan."
"This paper extends the RRT* algorithm, a recently developed but widely-used
sampling-based optimal motion planner, in order to effectively handle nonlinear
kinodynamic constraints. Nonlinearity in kinodynamic differential constraints
often leads to difficulties in choosing appropriate distance metric and in
computing optimized trajectory segments in tree construction. To tackle these
two difficulties, this work adopts the affine quadratic regulator-based pseudo
metric as the distance measure and utilizes iterative two-point boundary value
problem solvers for computing the optimized segments. The proposed extension
then preserves the inherent asymptotic optimality of the RRT* framework, while
efficiently handling a variety of kinodynamic constraints. Three numerical case
studies validate the applicability of the proposed method."
"In this paper we propose an approach for efficient grasp selection for
manipulation tasks of unknown objects. Even for simple tasks such as
pick-and-place, a unique solution is rare to occur. Rather, multiple candidate
grasps must be considered and (potentially) tested till a successful,
kinematically feasible path is found. To make this process efficient, the
grasps should be ordered such that those more likely to succeed are tested
first. We propose to use grasp manipulability as a metric to prioritize grasps.
We present results of simulation experiments which demonstrate the usefulness
of our metric. Additionally, we present experiments with our physical robot
performing simple manipulation tasks with a small set of different household
objects."
"In this paper, we address the problem of time-optimal coordination of mobile
robots under kinodynamic constraints along specified paths. We propose a novel
approach based on time discretization that leads to a mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) formulation. This problem can be solved using
general-purpose MILP solvers in a reasonable time, resulting in a
resolution-optimal solution. Moreover, unlike previous work found in the
literature, our formulation allows an exact linear modeling (up to the
discretization resolution) of second-order dynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
"Topological motion planning is a planning problem embedding topological
concept of trajectories. In this work, we propose two asymptotically optimal
sampling-based algorithms for topological motion planning: (a) a batch
processing-based planner, termed Fast Marching Homology-embedded Tree star
(FMHT*); and (b) an incremental anytime algorithm, termed Rapidly-exploring
Random Homology-embedded Tree star (RRHT*). The methods commonly expand a graph
directly in the configuration space and project the associated tree onto the
topological concept-augmented space; the computational cost in edge computation
and collision checking is significantly reduced by allowing trajectories with
different topology to share the edge and collision information. Illustrative
numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability
of the proposed approach."
"Traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS) are used in order to avoid
incidences of mid-air collisions between aircraft. We present a game-theoretic
approach of a TCAS designed for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A
variant of the canonical example of game-theoretic learning, fictitious play,
is used as a coordination mechanism between the UAVs, that should choose
between the alternative altitudes to fly and avoid collision. We present the
implementation results of the proposed coordination mechanism in two
quad-copters flying in opposite directions."
"Biomimetic entirely soft robots with animal-like behavior and integrated
artificial nervous systems will open up totally new perspectives and
applications. However, until now all presented studies on soft robots were
limited to partly soft designs, since all designs at least needed conventional,
stiff, electronics, to sense, process signals and activate actuators. We
present the first soft robot with integrated artificial nervous system entirely
made of dielectric elastomers - and without any conventional stiff electronic
parts. Supplied with only one external DC voltage, the robot autonomously
generates all signals necessary to drive its actuators, and translates an
in-plane electromechanical oscillation into a crawling locomotion movement.
Thereby, all functional parts are made of polymer materials and carbon. Besides
the basic design of the world's first entirely soft robot we present prospects
to control general behavior of such robots."
"Robots that autonomously manipulate objects within warehouses have the
potential to shorten the package delivery time and improve the efficiency of
the e-commerce industry. In this paper, we present a robotic system that is
capable of both picking and placing general objects in warehouse scenarios.
Given a target object, the robot autonomously detects it from a shelf or a
table and estimates its full 6D pose. With this pose information, the robot
picks the object using its gripper, and then places it into a container or at a
specified location. We describe our pick-and-place system in detail while
highlighting our design principles for the warehouse settings, including the
perception method that leverages knowledge about its workspace, three grippers
designed to handle a large variety of different objects in terms of shape,
weight and material, and grasp planning in cluttered scenarios. We also present
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our picking system and
demonstrate that the robot is competent to accomplish various tasks in
warehouse settings, such as picking a target item from a tight space, grasping
different objects from the shelf, and performing pick-and-place tasks on the
table."
"This paper describes the design, implementation and testing of a suite of
algorithms to enable depth constrained autonomous bathymetric (underwater
topography) mapping by an Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV). Given a target depth
and a bounding polygon, the ASV will find and follow the intersection of the
bounding polygon and the depth contour as modeled online with a Gaussian
Process (GP). This intersection, once mapped, will then be used as a boundary
within which a path will be planned for coverage to build a map of the
Bathymetry. Methods for sequential updates to GP's are described allowing
online fitting, prediction and hyper-parameter optimisation on a small embedded
PC. New algorithms are introduced for the partitioning of convex polygons to
allow efficient path planning for coverage. These algorithms are tested both in
simulation and in the field with a small twin hull differential thrust vessel
built for the task."
"Object handover is a basic, but essential capability for robots interacting
with humans in many applications, e.g., caring for the elderly and assisting
workers in manufacturing workshops. It appears deceptively simple, as humans
perform object handover almost flawlessly. The success of humans, however,
belies the complexity of object handover as collaborative physical interaction
between two agents with limited communication. This paper presents a learning
algorithm for dynamic object handover, for example, when a robot hands over
water bottles to marathon runners passing by the water station. We formulate
the problem as contextual policy search, in which the robot learns object
handover by interacting with the human. A key challenge here is to learn the
latent reward of the handover task under noisy human feedback. Preliminary
experiments show that the robot learns to hand over a water bottle naturally
and that it adapts to the dynamics of human motion. One challenge for the
future is to combine the model-free learning algorithm with a model-based
planning approach and enable the robot to adapt over human preferences and
object characteristics, such as shape, weight, and surface texture."
"This paper presents the design of a small aerial robot for inhabited
microgravity environments, such as orbiting space stations (e.g., ISS). In
particular, we target a fleet of robots, called Space CoBots, for collaborative
tasks with humans, such as telepresence and cooperative mobile manipulation.
The design is modular, comprising an hexrotor based propulsion system, and a
stack of modules including batteries, cameras for navigation, a screen for
telepresence, a robotic arm, space for extension modules, and a pair of docking
ports. These ports can be used for docking and for mechanically attaching two
Space CoBots together. The kinematics is holonomic, and thus the translational
and the rotational components can be fully decoupled. We employ a
multi-criteria optimization approach to determine the best geometric
configuration for maximum thrust and torque across all directions. We also
tackle the problem of motion control: we use separate converging controllers
for position and attitude control. Finally, we present simulation results using
a realistic physics simulator. These experiments include a sensitivity
evaluation to sensor noise and to unmodeled dynamics, namely a load
transportation."
"Autonomous flight of pocket drones is challenging due to the severe
limitations on on-board energy, sensing, and processing power. However, tiny
drones have great potential as their small size allows maneuvering through
narrow spaces while their small weight provides significant safety advantages.
This paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for determining
optical flow, which can be run on an STM32F4 microprocessor (168 MHz) of a 4
gram stereo-camera. The optical flow algorithm is based on edge histograms. We
propose a matching scheme to determine local optical flow. Moreover, the method
allows for sub-pixel flow determination based on time horizon adaptation. We
demonstrate velocity measurements in flight and use it within a velocity
control-loop on a pocket drone."
"Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a reliable learning mechanism in which a
robot uses an original, trusted sensor cue for training to recognize an
additional, complementary sensor cue. We study for the first time in SSL how a
robot's learning behavior should be organized, so that the robot can keep
performing its task in the case that the original cue becomes unavailable. We
study this persistent form of SSL in the context of a flying robot that has to
avoid obstacles based on distance estimates from the visual cue of stereo
vision. Over time it will learn to also estimate distances based on monocular
appearance cues. A strategy is introduced that has the robot switch from stereo
vision based flight to monocular flight, with stereo vision purely used as
'training wheels' to avoid imminent collisions. This strategy is shown to be an
effective approach to the 'feedback-induced data bias' problem as also
experienced in learning from demonstration. Both simulations and real-world
experiments with a stereo vision equipped AR drone 2.0 show the feasibility of
this approach, with the robot successfully using monocular vision to avoid
obstacles in a 5 x 5 room. The experiments show the potential of persistent SSL
as a robust learning approach to enhance the capabilities of robots. Moreover,
the abundant training data coming from the own sensors allows to gather large
data sets necessary for deep learning approaches."
"In this letter we focus on designing self-organizing diffusion mobile
adaptive networks where the individual agents are allowed to move in pursuit of
an objective (target). The well-known Adapt-then-Combine (ATC) algorithm is
already available in the literature as a useful distributed diffusion-based
adaptive learning network. However, in the ATC diffusion algorithm, fixed step
sizes are used in the update equations for velocity vectors and location
vectors. When the nodes are too far away from the target, such strategies may
require large number of iterations to reach the target. To address this issue,
in this paper we suggest two modifications on the ATC mobile adaptive network
to improve its performance. The proposed modifications include (i)
distance-based variable step size adjustment at diffusion algorithms to update
velocity vectors and location vectors (ii) to use a selective cooperation, by
choosing the best nodes at each iteration to reduce the number of
communications. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by
simulation tests where the obtained results show the superior performance of
the proposed algorithm in comparison with the available ATC mobile adaptive
network."
"One of the standing challenges in multi-robot systems is the ability to
reliably coordinate motions of multiple robots in environments where the robots
are subject to disturbances. We consider disturbances that force the robot to
temporarily stop and delay its advancement along its planned trajectory which
can be used to model, e.g., passing-by humans for whom the robots have to
yield. Although reactive collision-avoidance methods are often used in this
context, they may lead to deadlocks between robots. We design a multi-robot
control strategy for executing coordinated trajectories computed by a
multi-robot trajectory planner and give a proof that the strategy is safe and
deadlock-free even when robots are subject to delaying disturbances. Our
simulations show that the proposed strategy scales significantly better with
the intensity of disturbances than the naive liveness-preserving approach. The
empirical results further confirm that the proposed approach is more reliable
and also more efficient than state-of-the-art reactive techniques."
"We present a method to apply heuristic search algorithms to solve
rearrangement planning by pushing problems. In these problems, a robot must
push an object through clutter to achieve a goal. To do this, we exploit the
fact that contact with objects in the environment is critical to goal
achievement. We dynamically generate goal-directed primitives that create and
maintain contact between robot and object at each state expansion during the
search. These primitives focus exploration toward critical areas of
state-space, providing tractability to the high-dimensional planning problem.
We demonstrate that the use of these primitives, combined with an informative
yet simple to compute heuristic, improves success rate when compared to a
planner that uses only primitives formed from discretizing the robot's action
space. In addition, we show our planner outperforms RRT-based approaches by
producing shorter paths faster. We demonstrate our algorithm both in simulation
and on a 7-DOF arm pushing objects on a table."
"In literature, several approaches are trying to make the UAVs fly
autonomously i.e., by extracting perspective cues such as straight lines.
However, it is only available in well-defined human made environments, in
addition to many other cues which require enough texture information. Our main
target is to detect and avoid frontal obstacles from a monocular camera using a
quad rotor Ar.Drone 2 by exploiting optical flow as a motion parallax, the
drone is permitted to fly at a speed of 1 m/s and an altitude ranging from 1 to
4 meters above the ground level. In general, detecting and avoiding frontal
obstacle is a quite challenging problem because optical flow has some
limitation which should be taken into account i.e. lighting conditions and
aperture problem."
"This paper proposes a strategy for a group of deaf and dumb robots, carrying
clocks from different countries, to meet at a geographical location which is
not fixed in advanced. The robots act independently. They can observe others,
compute some locations and walk towards those locations. They can only get a
snapshot of the locations of other robots but can not detect whether they are
static or in motion. The robots are forgetful; once they have completed their
motion they forget their previous locations and observations. Again they decide
new destinations to move to. Eventually all the robots compute the same
destination and meet there. There exists no global positioning system. As they
stand, they agree on up and down directions. However, as they do not have any
compass, the other directions are not agreed upon. They also do not agree on
the clockwise direction. For determining a strategy, we imagine the robots to
be points on a three dimensional plane where all the robots are mutually
visible to each other always. The strategy we propose has to be obeyed by all
the robots independently with respect to their own clock and compass. Initially
the robots start from distinct locations. Some dead robots may be present in
the system or some may die any time before or after the get together. However,
the live robots are not aware of the presence of these dead robots."
"This paper describes the development of the Robotarium -- a remotely
accessible, multi-robot research facility. The impetus behind the Robotarium is
that multi-robot testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the
multi-agent research cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming
to develop, operate, and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit
access for large groups of researchers and students, which is what the
Robotarium is remedying by providing users with remote access to a
state-of-the-art multi-robot test facility. This paper details the design and
operation of the Robotarium as well as connects these to the particular
considerations one must take when making complex hardware remotely accessible.
In particular, safety must be built in already at the design phase without
overly constraining which coordinated control programs the users can upload and
execute, which calls for minimally invasive safety routines with provable
performance guarantees."
"The development of autonomous lightweight MAVs, capable of navigating in
unknown indoor environments, is one of the major challenges in robotics. The
complexity of this challenge comes from constraints on weight and power
consumption of onboard sensing and processing devices. In this paper we propose
the ""Droplet"" strategy, an avoidance strategy based on stereo vision inputs
that outperforms reactive avoidance strategies by allowing constant speed
maneuvers while being computationally extremely efficient, and which does not
need to store previous images or maps. The strategy deals with nonholonomic
motion constraints of most fixed and flapping wing platforms, and with the
limited field-of-view of stereo camera systems. It guarantees obstacle-free
flight in the absence of sensor and motor noise. We first analyze the strategy
in simulation, and then show its robustness in real-world conditions by
implementing it on a 20-gram flapping wing MAV."
"We do a Probabilistic Analysis of the Network generated by robots involved in
Stochastic Boundary Coverage"
"This paper considers the problem of manipulating a uniformly rotating chain:
the chain is rotated at a constant angular speed around a fixed axis using a
robotic manipulator. Manipulation is quasi-static in the sense that transitions
are slow enough for the chain to be always in ""rotational"" equilibrium. The
curve traced by the chain in a rotating plane -- its shape function -- can be
determined by a simple force analysis, yet it possesses complex multi-solutions
behavior typical of non-linear systems. We prove that the configuration space
of the uniformly rotating chain is homeomorphic to a two-dimensional surface
embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Using that representation, we devise a manipulation
strategy for transiting between different rotation modes in a stable and
controlled manner. We demonstrate the strategy on a physical robotic arm
manipulating a rotating chain. Finally, we discuss how the ideas developed here
might find fruitful applications in the study of other flexible objects, such
as elastic rods or concentric tubes."
"As autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles are deployed on the roads, they
will have to eventually start communicating with each other in order to achieve
increased efficiency and safety. Current approaches in the control of
collaborative vehicles primarily consider homogeneous simplified vehicle
dynamics and usually ignore any communication issues. This raises an important
question of how systems without the aforementioned limiting assumptions can be
modeled, analyzed and certified for safe operation by both industry and
governmental agencies. In this work, we propose a modeling framework where
communication and system reconfiguration is modeled through $\pi$-calculus
expressions while the closed-loop control systems are modeled through hybrid
automata. We demonstrate how the framework can be utilized for modeling and
simulation of platooning behaviors of heterogeneous vehicles."
"Promoting the levels of autonomy facilitates the vehicle in performing
long-range operations with minimum supervision. The capability of Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to fulfill the mission objectives is directly
influenced by route planning and task assignment system performance.
  The system fives the error of ""Bad character(s) in field Abstract"" for no
reason. Please refer to manuscript for the full abstract"
"Expansion of today's underwater scenarios and missions necessitates the
requestion for robust decision making of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
(AUV); hence, design an efficient decision making framework is essential for
maximizing the mission productivity in a restricted time. This paper focuses on
developing a deliberative conflict-free-task assignment architecture
encompassing a Global Route Planner (GRP) and a Local Path Planner (LPP) to
provide consistent motion planning encountering both environmental dynamic
changes and a priori knowledge of the terrain, so that the AUV is reactively
guided to the target of interest in the context of an unknown underwater
environment. The architecture involves three main modules: The GRP module at
the top level deals with the task priority assignment, mission time management,
and determination of a feasible route between start and destination point in a
large scale environment. The LPP module at the lower level deals with safety
considerations and generates collision-free optimal trajectory between each
specific pair of waypoints listed in obtained global route. Re-planning module
tends to promote robustness and reactive ability of the AUV with respect to the
environmental changes. The experimental results for different simulated
missions, demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic efficiency of the
proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of mission
productivity, mission time management, and vehicle safety."
"The Amazon Picking Challenge (APC), held alongside the International
Conference on Robotics and Automation in May 2015 in Seattle, challenged
roboticists from academia and industry to demonstrate fully automated solutions
to the problem of picking objects from shelves in a warehouse fulfillment
scenario. Packing density, object variability, speed, and reliability are the
main complexities of the task. The picking challenge serves both as a
motivation and an instrument to focus research efforts on a specific
manipulation problem. In this document, we describe Team MIT's approach to the
competition, including design considerations, contributions, and performance,
and we compile the lessons learned. We also describe what we think are the main
remaining challenges."
"Recent approaches in robotics follow the insight that perception is
facilitated by interaction with the environment. These approaches are subsumed
under the term of Interactive Perception (IP). It provides the following
benefits: (i) interaction with the environment creates a rich sensory signal
that would otherwise not be present and (ii) knowledge of the regularity in the
combined space of sensory data and action parameters facilitate the prediction
and interpretation of the signal. In this survey we postulate this as a
principle and collect evidence in support by analyzing and categorizing
existing work in this area. We also provide an overview of the most important
applications of Interactive Perception. We close this survey by discussing
remaining open questions. Thereby, we hope to define a field and inspire future
work."
"Pushing is a motion primitive useful to handle objects that are too large,
too heavy, or too cluttered to be grasped. It is at the core of much of robotic
manipulation, in particular when physical interaction is involved. It seems
reasonable then to wish for robots to understand how pushed objects move.
  In reality, however, robots often rely on approximations which yield models
that are computable, but also restricted and inaccurate. Just how close are
those models? How reasonable are the assumptions they are based on? To help
answer these questions, and to get a better experimental understanding of
pushing, we present a comprehensive and high-fidelity dataset of planar pushing
experiments. The dataset contains timestamped poses of a circular pusher and a
pushed object, as well as forces at the interaction.We vary the push
interaction in 6 dimensions: surface material, shape of the pushed object,
contact position, pushing direction, pushing speed, and pushing acceleration.
An industrial robot automates the data capturing along precisely controlled
position-velocity-acceleration trajectories of the pusher, which give dense
samples of positions and forces of uniform quality.
  We finish the paper by characterizing the variability of friction, and
evaluating the most common assumptions and simplifications made by models of
frictional pushing in robotics."
"Robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) can benefit from the
automation of common, repetitive or well-defined but ergonomically difficult
tasks. One such task is the scanning of a pick-up endomicroscopy probe over a
complex, undulating tissue surface in order to enhance the effective
field-of-view through video mosaicing. In this paper, the da Vinci surgical
robot, through the dVRK framework, is used for autonomous scanning and 2D
mosaicing over a user-defined region of interest. To achieve the level of
precision required for high quality large-area mosaic generation, which relies
on sufficient overlap between consecutive image frames, visual servoing is
performed using a tracking marker attached to the probe. The resulting
sub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large
endomicroscopy mo- saics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. It also
allows the probe to be maintained in an orientation perpendicular to the local
tissue surface, providing optimal imaging results. Images are streamed from the
endomicroscope and overlaid live onto the surgeons view, while 2D mosaics are
generated in real-time, and fused into a 3D stereo reconstruction of the
surgical scene, thus providing intuitive visualisation and fusion of the
multi-scale images. The system therefore offers significant potential to
enhance surgical procedures, by providing the operator with cellular-scale
information over a larger area than could typically be achieved by manual
scanning."
"Thanks to the efforts of the robotics and autonomous systems community,
robots are becoming ever more capable. There is also an increasing demand from
end-users for autonomous service robots that can operate in real environments
for extended periods. In the STRANDS project we are tackling this demand
head-on by integrating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and robotics
research into mobile service robots, and deploying these systems for long-term
installations in security and care environments. Over four deployments, our
robots have been operational for a combined duration of 104 days autonomously
performing end-user defined tasks, covering 116km in the process. In this
article we describe the approach we have used to enable long-term autonomous
operation in everyday environments, and how our robots are able to use their
long run times to improve their own performance."
"Large-Scale Actuator Networks (LSAN) are a rapidly growing class of
electromechanical systems. A prime application of LSANs in the industrial
sector is distributed manipulation. LSAN's are typically implemented using:
vibrating plates, air jets, and mobile multi-robot teams. This paper
investigates a surface capable of morphing its shape using an array of linear
actuators to impose two dimensional translational movement on a set of objects.
The collective nature of the actuator network overcomes the limitations of the
single Degree of Freedom (DOF) manipulators, and forms a complex topography to
convey multiple objects to a reference location. A derivation of the kinematic
constraints and limitations of an arbitrary multi-cell surface is provided.
These limitations determine the allowable actuator alignments when configuring
the surface. A fusion of simulation and practical results demonstrate the
advantages of using this technology over static feeders."
"Recently, there have been numerous advances in the development of
biologically inspired lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). While
autonomous navigation is fairly straight-forward for large UAVs as expensive
sensors and monitoring devices can be employed, robust methods for obstacle
avoidance remains a challenging task for MAVs which operate at low altitude in
cluttered unstructured environments. Due to payload and power constraints, it
is necessary for such systems to have autonomous navigation and flight
capabilities using mostly passive sensors such as cameras. In this paper, we
describe a robust system that enables autonomous navigation of small agile
quad-rotors at low altitude through natural forest environments. We present a
direct depth estimation approach that is capable of producing accurate,
semi-dense depth-maps in real time. Furthermore, a novel wind-resistant control
scheme is presented that enables stable way-point tracking even in the presence
of strong winds. We demonstrate the performance of our system through extensive
experiments on real images and field tests in a cluttered outdoor environment."
"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are capable of spending long periods of
time for carrying out various underwater missions and marine tasks. In this
paper, a novel conflict-free motion planning framework is introduced to enhance
underwater vehicle's mission performance by completing maximum number of
highest priority tasks in a limited time through a large scale waypoint
cluttered operating field, and ensuring safe deployment during the mission. The
proposed combinatorial route-path planner model takes the advantages of the
biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm toward satisfying objectives of
both higher-lower level motion planners and guarantees maximization of the
mission productivity for a single vehicle operation. The performance of the
model is investigated under different scenarios including the particular cost
constraints in time-varying operating fields. To show the reliability of the
proposed model, performance of each motion planner assessed separately and then
statistical analysis is undertaken to evaluate the total performance of the
entire model. The simulation results indicate the stability of the contributed
model and its feasible application for real experiments."
"Integrated Task and Motion Planning (ITMP) for mobile robots in a dynamic
environment with moving obstacles is a challenging research question and
attracts more and more attentions recently. Most existing methods either
restrict to static environments or lack performance guarantees. This motivates
us to investigate the ITMP problem using formal methods and propose a bottom-up
compositional design approach called CoSMoP (Composition of Safe Motion
Primitives). Our basic idea is to synthesize a global motion plan through
composing simple local moves and actions, and to achieve its performance
guarantee through modular and incremental verifications. The design consists of
two steps. First, basic motion primitives are designed and verified locally.
Then, a global motion path is built upon these certified motion primitives by
concatenating them together. In particular, we model the motion primitives as
hybrid automata and verify their safety through formulating as Differential
Dynamic Logic (d$\mathcal{L}$). Furthermore, these proven safe motion
primitives are composed based on an encoding to Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT) that takes into account the geometric constraints. Since d$\mathcal{L}$
allows compositional verification, the sequential composition of the safe
motion primitives also preserves safety properties. Therefore, the CoSMoP
generates correct plans for given task specifications that are formally proven
safe even for moving obstacles. Illustrative examples are presented to show the
effectiveness of the methods."
"The robot soccer game based complex motion control has been widely studied
for the moving object capture and shooting. A position prediction algorithm
based on global vision is introduced in order to improve the accuracy and
robustness of the vision system for tracking moving objects, including a
Kalmanfiter, a dynamic window and an obstacle avoidance strategy. This paper
deals with the positon prediction for moving ball by using Kalmanfiter and the
Fuzzy Controller for shooting action in a dynamic environment."
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles in problems with delayed rewards, and
one approach is to segment the task into sub-tasks with incremental rewards. We
propose a framework called Hierarchical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (HIRL),
which is a model for learning sub-task structure from demonstrations. HIRL
decomposes the task into sub-tasks based on transitions that are consistent
across demonstrations. These transitions are defined as changes in local
linearity w.r.t to a kernel function. Then, HIRL uses the inferred structure to
learn reward functions local to the sub-tasks but also handle any global
dependencies such as sequentiality.
  We have evaluated HIRL on several standard RL benchmarks: Parallel Parking
with noisy dynamics, Two-Link Pendulum, 2D Noisy Motion Planning, and a Pinball
environment. In the parallel parking task, we find that rewards constructed
with HIRL converge to a policy with an 80% success rate in 32% fewer time-steps
than those constructed with Maximum Entropy Inverse RL (MaxEnt IRL), and with
partial state observation, the policies learned with IRL fail to achieve this
accuracy while HIRL still converges. We further find that that the rewards
learned with HIRL are robust to environment noise where they can tolerate 1
stdev. of random perturbation in the poses in the environment obstacles while
maintaining roughly the same convergence rate. We find that HIRL rewards can
converge up-to 6x faster than rewards constructed with IRL."
"This short technical report illustrates the results of a test procedure we
performed to validate the computer simulation of the HyQ robot."
"In this study, a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) aims to
rendezvous with a submerged leader recovery vehicle through a cluttered and
variable operating field. The rendezvous problem is transformed into a
nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP) and then numerical solutions are
provided. A penalty function method is utilized to combine the boundary
conditions, vehicular and environmental constraints with the performance index
that is final rendezvous time.Four evolutionary based path planning methods
namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), biogeography-based optimization
(BBO), differential evolution (DE) and Firefly algorithm (FA) are employed to
establish a reactive planner module and provide a numerical solution for the
proposed NOCP. The objective is to synthesize and analysis the performance and
capability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from loitering point
toward the rendezvous place through a comprehensive simulation study.The
proposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering
situational awareness of underlying environment, encompassing static and
dynamic obstacles overwhelmed in spatiotemporal current vectors.This leads to
accommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field like emergence of
unpredicted obstacles or variability of current vector filed and turbulent
regions. The simulation results demonstrate the inherent robustness and
significant efficiency of the proposed planner in enhancement of the vehicle's
autonomy in terms of using current force, coping undesired current disturbance
for the desired rendezvous purpose. Advantages and shortcoming of all utilized
methods are also presented based on the obtained results."
"We estimate the state a noisy robot arm and underactuated hand using an
Implicit Manifold Particle Filter (MPF) informed by touch sensors. As the robot
touches the world, its state space collapses to a contact manifold that we
represent implicitly using a signed distance field. This allows us to extend
the MPF to higher (six or more) dimensional state spaces. Earlier work (which
explicitly represents the contact manifold) only shows the MPF in two or three
dimensions. Through a series of experiments, we show that the implicit MPF
converges faster and is more accurate than a conventional particle filter
during periods of persistent contact. We present three methods of sampling the
implicit contact manifold, and compare them in experiments."
"Self-driving vehicles are a maturing technology with the potential to reshape
mobility by enhancing the safety, accessibility, efficiency, and convenience of
automotive transportation. Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a
self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment
shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via
feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of
the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban
setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion
of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility
model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in
computational requirements. The side-by-side comparison presented in this
survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed
approaches and assists with system level design choices."
"This paper presents a hybrid route-path planning model for an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle's task assignment and management while the AUV is operating
through the variable littoral waters. Several prioritized tasks distributed in
a large scale terrain is defined first; then, considering the limitations over
the mission time, vehicle's battery, uncertainty and variability of the
underlying operating field, appropriate mission timing and energy management is
undertaken. The proposed objective is fulfilled by incorporating a
route-planner that is in charge of prioritizing the list of available tasks
according to available battery and a path-planer that acts in a smaller scale
to provide vehicle's safe deployment against environmental sudden changes. The
synchronous process of the task assign-route and path planning is simulated
using a specific composition of Differential Evolution and Firefly Optimization
(DEFO) Algorithms. The simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid
model offers efficient performance in terms of completion of maximum number of
assigned tasks while perfectly expending the minimum energy, provided by using
the favorable current flow, and controlling the associated mission time. The
Monte-Carlo test is also performed for further analysis. The corresponding
results show the significant robustness of the model against uncertainties of
the operating field and variations of mission conditions."
"The purpose of this paper is to provide a hierarchical dynamic mission
planning framework for a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to
accomplish task-assign process in a limited time interval while operating in an
uncertain undersea environment, where spatio-temporal variability of the
operating field is taken into account. To this end, a high level reactive
mission planner and a low level motion planning system are constructed. The
high level system is responsible for task priority assignment and guiding the
vehicle toward a target of interest considering on-time termination of the
mission. The lower layer is in charge of generating optimal trajectories based
on sequence of tasks and dynamicity of operating terrain. The mission planner
is able to reactively re-arrange the tasks based on mission/terrain updates
while the low level planner is capable of coping unexpected changes of the
terrain by correcting the old path and re-generating a new trajectory. As a
result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with
certain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating
field. The computational engine of the mentioned framework is based on the
biogeography based optimization (BBO) algorithm that is capable of providing
efficient solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework,
firstly, a realistic model of undersea environment is provided based on
realistic map data, and then several scenarios, treated as real experiments,
are designed through the simulation study. Additionally, to show the robustness
and reliability of the framework, Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out and
statistical analysis is performed. The results of simulations indicate the
significant potential of the two-level hierarchical mission planning system in
mission success and its applicability for real-time implementation."
"We study the nonlinear observability of a systems states in view of how well
they are observable and what control inputs would improve the convergence of
their estimates. We use these insights to develop an observability-aware
trajectory-optimization framework for nonlinear systems that produces
trajectories well suited for self-calibration. Common trajectory-planning
algorithms tend to generate motions that lead to an unobservable subspace of
the system state, causing suboptimal state estimation. We address this problem
with a method that reasons about the quality of observability while respecting
system dynamics and motion constraints to yield the optimal trajectory for
rapid convergence of the self-calibration states (or other user-chosen states).
Experiments performed on a simulated quadrotor system with a GPS-IMU sensor
suite demonstrate the benefits of the optimized observability-aware
trajectories when compared to a covariance-based approach and multiple
heuristic approaches. Our method is approx. 80x faster than the
covariance-based approach and achieves better results than any other approach
in the self-calibration task. We applied our method to a waypoint navigation
task and achieved a approx. 2x improvement in the integrated RMSE of the global
position estimates and approx. 4x improvement in the integrated RMSE of the
GPS-IMU transformation estimates compared to a minimal-energy trajectory
planner."
"The objective of this paper is to provide consistent, real-time 3D
localization capabilities to mobile devices navigating within previously mapped
areas. To this end, we introduce the Cholesky-Schmidt-Kalman filter (C-SKF),
which explicitly considers the uncertainty of the prior map, by employing the
sparse Cholesky factor of the map's Hessian, instead of its dense
covariance--as is the case for the Schmidt-Kalman filter (SKF). By doing so,
the C-SKF has memory requirements typically linear in the size of the map, as
opposed to quadratic for storing the map's covariance. Moreover, and in order
to bound the processing needs of the C-SKF (between linear and quadratic in the
size of the map), we introduce a relaxation of the C-SKF algorithm, the sC-SKF,
which operates on the Cholesky factors of independent sub-maps resulting from
dividing the trajectory and observations used for constructing the map into
overlapping segments. Lastly, we assess the processing and memory requirements
of the proposed C-SKF and sC-SKF algorithms, and compare their positioning
accuracy against other approximate map-based localization approaches that
employ measurement-noise-covariance inflation to compensate for the map's
uncertainty."
"Today AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with
low real autonomy due to battery restrictions. Efficient motion planning and
mission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and
facilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations. A single vehicle cannot
carry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree
of autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the
mission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the
available time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission. In
this respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including
higher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible
for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while
guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by
several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle's safe
deployment in a smaller scale encountering time-varying ocean current and
different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean
environment. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is
efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time
termination of the mission. The performance and accuracy of two higher and
lower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly
optimization algorithm, respectively. After all, the overall performance of the
architecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios. The analyze of
the captured results from different simulated missions confirm the efficiency
and inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time
management, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper
prioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time."
"Most traditional robotic mechanisms feature inelastic joints that are unable
to robustly handle large deformations and off-axis moments. As a result, the
applied loads are transferred rigidly throughout the entire structure. The
disadvantage of this approach is that the exerted leverage is magnified at each
subsequent joint possibly damaging the mechanism. In this paper, we present two
lightweight, elastic, bio-inspired tensegrity robotics arms which mitigate this
danger while improving their mechanism's functionality. Our solutions feature
modular tensegrity structures that function similarly to the human elbow and
the human shoulder when connected. Like their biological counterparts, the
proposed robotic joints are flexible and comply with unanticipated forces. Both
proposed structures have multiple passive degrees of freedom and four active
degrees of freedom (two from the shoulder and two from the elbow). The
structural advantages demonstrated by the joints in these manipulators
illustrate a solution to the fundamental issue of elegantly handling off-axis
compliance."
"Mobile robot navigation in total or partially unknown environments is still
an open problem. The path planning algorithms lack completeness and/or
performance. Thus, there is the need for complete (i.e., the algorithm
determines in finite time either a solution or correctly reports that there is
none) and performance (i.e., with low computational complexity) oriented
algorithms which need to perform efficiently in real scenarios. In this paper
we evaluate the efficiency of two versions of the A star algorithm for mobile
robot navigation inside indoor environments with the help of two software
applications and the Pioneer 2DX robot. We demonstrate that an improved version
of the A star algorithm (we call this the fast A star algorithm) which (a
different version of this algorithm is widely used in video games) can be
successfully used for indoor mobile robot navigation. We evaluated the two
versions of the A star algorithm first, by implementing the algorithms in
source code and by testing them on a simulator and second, by comparing two
operation modes of the fast A star algorithm w.r.t. path planning efficiency
(i.e., completness) and performance (i.e., time need to complete the path
traversing) for indoor navigation with the Pioneer 2DX robot. The results
obtained with the fast A star algorithm are promising and we think that this
results can be further improved by tweaking the algorithm and by using an
advanced sensor fusion approach (i.e., combine the inputs of multiple robot
sensors) for better dealing with partially known environments."
"This paper investigates a situation pointed out in a recent paper, in which a
non-singular change of assembly mode of a planar 2-RPR-PR parallel manipulator
was realized by encircling a point of multiplicity 4. It is shown that this
situation is, in fact, a non-generic one and gives rise to cusps under a small
perturbation. Furthermore , we show that, for a large class of singularities of
multiplicity 4, there are only two types of stable singularities occurring in a
small perturbation: these two types are given by the complex square mapping and
the quarto mapping. Incidentally , this paper confirms the fact that,
generically, a local non-singular change of solution must be accomplished by
encircling a cusp point."
"Grasping an object is a matter of first moving a prehensile organ at some
position in the world, and then managing the contact relationship between the
prehensile organ and the object. Once the contact relationship has been
established and made stable, the object is part of the body and it can move in
the world. As any action, the action of grasping is ontologically anchored in
the physical space while the correlative movement originates in the space of
the body. Evolution has found amazing solutions that allow organisms to rapidly
and efficiently manage the relationship between their body and the world. It is
then natural that roboticists consider taking inspiration of these natural
solutions, while contributing to better understand their origin."
"This work presents a novel framework for the formation control of multiple
autonomous ground vehicles in an on-road environment. Unique challenges of this
problem lie in 1) the design of collision avoidance strategies with obstacles
and with other vehicles in a highly structured environment, 2) dynamic
reconfiguration of the formation to handle different task specifications. In
this paper, we design a local MPC-based tracking controller for each individual
vehicle to follow a reference trajectory while satisfying various constraints
(kinematics and dynamics, collision avoidance, \textit{etc.}). The reference
trajectory of a vehicle is computed from its leader's trajectory, based on a
pre-defined formation tree. We use logic rules to organize the collision
avoidance behaviors of member vehicles. Moreover, we propose a methodology to
safely reconfigure the formation on-the-fly. The proposed framework has been
validated using high-fidelity simulations."
"This work addresses the challenge of a robot using real-time feedback from
contact sensors to reliably manipulate a movable object on a cluttered
tabletop. We formulate contact manipulation as a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) in the joint space of robot configurations and object
poses. The POMDP formulation enables the robot to actively gather information
and reduce the uncertainty on the object pose. Further, it incorporates all
major constraints for robot manipulation: kinematic reachability,
self-collision, and collision with obstacles. To solve the POMDP, we apply
DESPOT, a state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithm. Our approach leverages two
key ideas for computational efficiency. First, it performs lazy construction of
a configuration-space lattice by interleaving construction of the lattice and
online POMDP planning. Second, it combines online and offline POMDP planning by
solving relaxed POMDP offline and using the solution to guide the online search
algorithm. We evaluated the proposed approach on a seven degree-of-freedom
robot arm in simulation environments. It significantly outperforms several
existing algorithms, including some commonly used heuristics for contact
manipulation under uncertainty."
"Most of the existing robotic exploration schemes use occupancy grid
representations and geometric targets known as frontiers. The occupancy grid
representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and
ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop an
incremental Gaussian Processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is
computationally tractable for online map building and provides a continuous
model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates. The standard way to
represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary
values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel probabilistic frontier
maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP occupancy map. We also
propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration technique built on that
representation that takes into account all possible future observations. A
major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the fact that such
techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map entropy
reduction during exploration for map building scenarios. Evaluations using the
publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework
for robotic mapping and exploration tasks."
"We present a self-contained, soft robotic hand composed of soft pneumatic
actuator modules that are equipped with strain and pressure sensing. We show
how this data can be used to discern whether a grasp was successful.
Co-locating sensing and embedded computation with the actuators greatly
simplifies control and system integration. Equipped with a small pump, the hand
is self-contained and needs only power and data supplied by a single USB
connection to a PC. We demonstrate its function by grasping a variety of
objects ranging from very small to large and heavy objects weighing more than
the hand itself. The presented system nicely illustrates the advantages of soft
robotics: low cost, low weight, and intrinsic compliance. We exploit
morphological computation to simplify control, which allows successful grasping
via underactuation. Grasping indeed relies on morphological computation at
multiple levels, ranging from the geometry of the actuator which determines the
actuator's kinematics, embedded strain sensors to measure curvature, to
maximizing contact area and applied force during grasping. Morphological
computation reaches its limitations, however, when objects are too bulky to
self-align with the gripper or when the state of grasping is of interest. We
therefore argue that efficient and reliable grasping also requires not only
intrinsic compliance, but also embedded sensing and computation. In particular,
we show how embedded sensing can be used to detect successful grasps and vary
the force exerted onto an object based on local feedback, which is not possible
using morphological computation alone."
"In this paper, a real-time quasi-optimal trajectory planning scheme is
employed to guide an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) safely into a
funnel-shape stationary docking station. By taking advantage of the direct
method of calculus of variation and inverse dynamics optimization, the proposed
trajectory planner provides a computationally efficient framework for
autonomous underwater docking in a 3D cluttered undersea environment. Vehicular
constraints, such as constraints on AUV states and actuators; boundary
conditions, including initial and final vehicle poses; and environmental
constraints, for instance no-fly zones and current disturbances, are all
modelled and considered in the problem formulation. The performance of the
proposed planner algorithm is analyzed through simulation studies. To show the
reliability and robustness of the method in dealing with uncertainty, Monte
Carlo runs and statistical analysis are carried out. The results of the
simulations indicate that the proposed planner is well suited for real-time
implementation in a dynamic and uncertain environment."
"We consider a decision-making problem where the environment varies both in
space and time. Such problems arise naturally when considering e.g., the
navigation of an underwater robot amidst ocean currents or the navigation of an
aerial vehicle in wind. To model such spatiotemporal variation, we extend the
standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) to a new framework called the
Time-Varying Markov Decision Process (TVMDP). The TVMDP has a time-varying
state transition model and transforms the standard MDP that considers only {\em
immediate} and {\em static} uncertainty descriptions of state transitions, to a
framework that is able to adapt to future time-varying uncertainty over some
horizon. We show how to solve a TVMDP via a redesign of the MDP value
propagation mechanisms by incorporating the introduced dynamics along the
temporal dimension. We validate our framework in a marine robotics navigation
setting using real spatiotemporal ocean data and show that it outperforms prior
efforts to explicitly accommodate time by including it in the state."
"Simultaneous Localization and Planning (SLAP) under process and measurement
uncertainties is a challenge. It involves solving a stochastic control problem
modeled as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) in a general
framework. For a convex environment, we propose an optimization-based open-loop
optimal control problem coupled with receding horizon control strategy to plan
for high quality trajectories along which the uncertainty of the state
localization is reduced while the system reaches to a goal state with minimum
control effort. In a static environment with non-convex state constraints, the
optimization is modified by defining barrier functions to obtain collision-free
paths while maintaining the previous goals. By initializing the optimization
with trajectories in different homotopy classes and comparing the resultant
costs, we improve the quality of the solution in the presence of action and
measurement uncertainties. In dynamic environments with time-varying
constraints such as moving obstacles or banned areas, the approach is extended
to find collision-free trajectories. In this paper, the underlying spaces are
continuous, and beliefs are non-Gaussian. Without obstacles, the optimization
is a globally convex problem, while in the presence of obstacles it becomes
locally convex. We demonstrate the performance of the method on different
scenarios."
"Providing a higher level of decision autonomy and accompanying prompt changes
of an uncertain environment is a true challenge of AUVs autonomous operations.
The proceeding approach introduces a robust reactive structure that
accommodates an AUV's mission planning, task-time management in a top level and
incorporates environmental changes by a synchronic motion planning in a lower
level. The proposed architecture is developed in a hierarchal modular format
and a bunch of evolutionary algorithms are employed by each module to
investigate the efficiency and robustness of the structure in different mission
scenarios while water current data, uncertain static-mobile/motile obstacles,
and vehicles Kino-dynamic constraints are taken into account. The motion
planner is facilitated with online re-planning capability to refine the
vehicle's trajectory based on local variations of the environment. A small
computational load is devoted for re-planning procedure since the upper layer
mission planner renders an efficient overview of the operation area that AUV
should fly thru. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate
robustness and performance of the architecture in different situations of a
real-world underwater environment. Analysis of the simulation results claims
the remarkable capability of the proposed model in accurate mission
task-time-threat management while guarantying a secure deployment during the
mission."
"Grid mapping is a well established approach for environment perception in
robotic and automotive applications. Early work suggests estimating the
occupancy state of each grid cell in a robot's environment using a Bayesian
filter to recursively combine new measurements with the current posterior state
estimate of each grid cell. This filter is often referred to as binary Bayes
filter (BBF). A basic assumption of classical occupancy grid maps is a
stationary environment. Recent publications describe bottom-up approaches using
particles to represent the dynamic state of a grid cell and outline
prediction-update recursions in a heuristic manner. This paper defines the
state of multiple grid cells as a random finite set, which allows to model the
environment as a stochastic, dynamic system with multiple obstacles, observed
by a stochastic measurement system. It motivates an original filter called the
probability hypothesis density / multi-instance Bernoulli (PHD/MIB) filter in a
top-down manner. The paper presents a real-time application serving as a fusion
layer for laser and radar sensor data and describes in detail a highly
efficient parallel particle filter implementation. A quantitative evaluation
shows that parameters of the stochastic process model affect the filter results
as theoretically expected and that appropriate process and observation models
provide consistent state estimation results."
"In this paper, we present a new model of biped locomotion which is composed
of three linear pendulums (one per leg and one for the whole upper body) to
describe stance, swing and torso dynamics. In addition to double support, this
model has different actuation possibilities in the swing hip and stance ankle
which could be widely used to produce different walking gaits. Without the need
for numerical time-integration, closed-form solutions help finding periodic
gaits which could be simply scaled in certain dimensions to modulate the motion
online. Thanks to linearity properties, the proposed model can provide a
computationally fast platform for model predictive controllers to predict the
future and consider meaningful inequality constraints to ensure feasibility of
the motion. Such property is coming from describing dynamics with joint torques
directly and therefore, reflecting hardware limitations more precisely, even in
the very abstract high level template space. The proposed model produces
human-like torque and ground reaction force profiles and thus, compared to
point-mass models, it is more promising for precise control of humanoid robots.
Despite being linear and lacking many other features of human walking like CoM
excursion, knee flexion and ground clearance, we show that the proposed model
can predict one of the main optimality trends in human walking, i.e. nonlinear
speed-frequency relationship. In this paper, we mainly focus on describing the
model and its capabilities, comparing it with human data and calculating
optimal human gait variables. Setting up control problems and advanced
biomechanical analysis still remain for future works."
"In this paper, we present a new walking controller based on 3LP model. Taking
advantage of linear equations and closed-form solutions of 3LP, the proposed
controller can project the state of the robot at any time during the phase back
to a certain event for which, a discrete LQR controller is designed. After the
projection, a proper control policy is generated by the expert discrete
controller and used online. This projecting architecture reacts to disturbances
with minimal delay and compared to discrete controllers, it provides superior
performance in recovering intermittent external pushes. Further analysis of
closed-loop eigenvalues and disturbance rejection shows that the proposed
time-projecting controller has strong stabilization properties. Controllable
regions also show that the projecting architecture covers most of the maximal
controllable set of states. It is computationally much faster than model
predictive controllers, but still optimal."
"In this paper, we give a double twist to the problem of planning under
uncertainty. State-of-the-art planners seek to minimize the localization
uncertainty by only considering the geometric structure of the scene. In this
paper, we argue that motion planning for vision-controlled robots should be
perception aware in that the robot should also favor texture-rich areas to
minimize the localization uncertainty during a goal-reaching task. Thus, we
describe how to optimally incorporate the photometric information (i.e.,
texture) of the scene, in addition to the the geometric one, to compute the
uncertainty of vision-based localization during path planning. To avoid the
caveats of feature-based localization systems (i.e., dependence on feature type
and user-defined thresholds), we use dense, direct methods. This allows us to
compute the localization uncertainty directly from the intensity values of
every pixel in the image. We also describe how to compute trajectories online,
considering also scenarios with no prior knowledge about the map. The proposed
framework is general and can easily be adapted to different robotic platforms
and scenarios. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with extensive
experiments in both simulated and real-world environments using a
vision-controlled micro aerial vehicle."
"Autonomous robots in unstructured and dynamically changing retail
environments have to master complex perception, knowledgeprocessing, and
manipulation tasks. To enable them to act competently, we propose a framework
based on three core components: (o) a knowledge-enabled perception system,
capable of combining diverse information sources to cope with occlusions and
stacked objects with a variety of textures and shapes, (o) knowledge processing
methods produce strategies for tidying up supermarket racks, and (o) the
necessary manipulation skills in confined spaces to arrange objects in
semi-accessible rack shelves. We demonstrate our framework in an simulated
environment as well as on a real shopping rack using a PR2 robot. Typical
supermarket products are detected and rearranged in the retail rack, tidying up
what was found to be misplaced items."
"Robots can generalize manipulation skills between different scenarios by
adapting to the features of the objects being manipulated. Selecting the set of
relevant features for generalizing skills has usually been performed manually
by a human. Alternatively, a robot can learn to select relevant features
autonomously. However, feature selection usually requires a large amount of
training data, which would require many demonstrations. In order to learn the
relevant features more efficiently, we propose using a meta-level prior to
transfer the relevance of features from previously learned skills. The
experiments show that the meta-level prior more than doubles the average
precision and recall of the feature selection when compared to a standard
uniform prior. The proposed approach was used to learn a variety of
manipulation skills, including pushing, cutting, and pouring."
"This paper describes a data-driven framework for approximate global
optimization in which precomputed solutions to a sample of problems are
retrieved and adapted during online use to solve novel problems. This approach
has promise for real-time applications in robotics, since it can produce
near-globally optimal solutions orders of magnitude faster than standard
methods. This paper establishes theoretical conditions on how many and where
samples are needed over the space of problems to achieve a given approximation
quality. The framework is applied to solve globally optimal collision-free
inverse kinematics (IK) problems, wherein large solution databases are used to
produce near-optimal solutions in sub-millisecond time on a standard PC."
"Automated vehicles (AVs) must be evaluated thoroughly before their release
and deployment. A widely-used evaluation approach is the Naturalistic-Field
Operational Test (N-FOT), which tests prototype vehicles directly on the public
roads. Due to the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs are
time-consuming and expensive to conduct. In this paper, we propose an
accelerated evaluation approach for AVs. The results can be used to generate
motions of the primary other vehicles to accelerate the verification of AVs in
simulations and controlled experiments. Frontal collision due to unsafe cut-ins
is the target crash type of this paper. Human-controlled vehicles making unsafe
lane changes are modeled as the primary disturbance to AVs based on data
collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program.
The cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed statistics of collected
human driver behaviors, which generate risky testing scenarios while preserving
the statistical information so that the safety benefits of AVs in
non-accelerated cases can be accurately estimated. The Cross Entropy method is
used to recursively search for the optimal skewing parameters. The frequencies
of occurrence of conflicts, crashes and injuries are estimated for a modeled
automated vehicle, and the achieved accelerated rate is around 2,000 to 20,000.
In other words, in the accelerated simulations, driving for 1,000 miles will
expose the AV with challenging scenarios that will take about 2 to 20 million
miles of real-world driving to encounter. This technique thus has the potential
to reduce greatly the development and validation time for AVs."
"Humans and animals developed a sophisticated motor control apparatus and
there is much evidence that it has a modular structure. The modularity offers a
range of benefits, e.g. ability to learn dissociable motion styles without
interference and forgetting, fast adaptation and de-adaptation to changes
conditions. However in robotics, building a controller that can efficiently
incrementally learn new motion styles and provide switching between them is a
formidable challenge. In this paper we address the problem by proposing a novel
biologically inspired compositional neuro-controller. We have shown that the
compositional controller is able to reproduce a set of trajectories more
efficiently comparing to a simple controller, exploiting incremental learning
benefits. Second, we have demonstrated that the proposed controller is able to
learn different locomotion styles and switch between them in a simulated
robot-snake."
"Path planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is a challenging problem
due to the added time dimension in search space. In approaches that ignore the
time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is
unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally
sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness,
it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of
adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion
planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the
context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the
idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic
environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model.
Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions
of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a
low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete
and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost
sub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of
3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show
that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over
4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates
significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic."
"We present a multimodal interaction framework suitable for a human rescuer
that operates in proximity with a set of co-located drones during search
missions. This work is framed in the context of the SHERPA project whose goal
is to develop a mixed ground and aerial robotic platform to support search and
rescue activities in a real-world alpine scenario. Differently from typical
human-drone interaction settings, here the operator is not fully dedicated to
the drones, but involved in search and rescue tasks, hence only able to provide
sparse, incomplete, although high-value, instructions to the robots. This
operative scenario requires a human-interaction framework that supports
multimodal communication along with an effective and natural mixed-initiative
interaction between the human and the robots. In this work, we illustrate the
domain and the proposed multimodal interaction framework discussing the system
at work in a simulated case study."
"When carrying out tasks in contact with the environment, humans are found to
concurrently adapt force, impedance and trajectory. Here we develop a robotic
model of this mechanism in humans and analyse the underlying dynamics. We
derive a general adaptive controller for the interaction of a robot with an
environment solely characterised by its stiffness and damping, using Lyapunov
theory."
"General-purpose mobile manipulators have the potential to serve as a
versatile form of assistive technology. However, their complexity creates
challenges, including the risk of being too difficult to use. We present a
proof-of-concept robotic system for assistive feeding that consists of a Willow
Garage PR2, a high-level web-based interface, and specialized autonomous
behaviors for scooping and feeding yogurt. As a step towards use by people with
disabilities, we evaluated our system with 5 able-bodied participants. All 5
successfully ate yogurt using the system and reported high rates of success for
the system's autonomous behaviors. Also, Henry Evans, a person with severe
quadriplegia, operated the system remotely to feed an able-bodied person. In
general, people who operated the system reported that it was easy to use,
including Henry. The feeding system also incorporates corrective actions
designed to be triggered either autonomously or by the user. In an offline
evaluation using data collected with the feeding system, a new version of our
multimodal anomaly detection system outperformed prior versions."
"This paper is essentially an exercise in studying the minima of a certain
least squares optimization using the second partial derivative test. The
motivation is to gain insight into an optimization-based solution to the
problem of tracking human limbs using IMU sensors."
"Optimal control approaches in combination with trajectory optimization have
recently proven to be a promising control strategy for legged robots.
Computationally efficient and robust algorithms were derived using simplified
models of the contact interaction between robot and environment such as the
linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM). However, as humanoid robots enter more
complex environments, less restrictive models become increasingly important. As
we leave the regime of linear models, we need to build dedicated solvers that
can compute interaction forces together with consistent kinematic plans for the
whole-body. In this paper, we address the problem of planning robot motion and
interaction forces for legged robots given predefined contact surfaces. The
motion generation process is decomposed into two alternating parts computing
force and motion plans in coherence. We focus on the properties of the momentum
computation leading to sparse optimal control formulations to be exploited by a
dedicated solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our motion generation
algorithm computes consistent contact forces and joint trajectories for our
humanoid robot. We also demonstrate the favorable time complexity due to our
formulation and composition of the momentum equations."
"There are many application fields for robotic systems including service
robotics, search and rescue missions, industry and space robotics. As the
scenarios in these areas grow more and more complex, there is a high demand for
powerful tools to efficiently program heterogeneous robotic systems. Therefore,
we created RAFCON, a graphical tool to develop robotic tasks and to be used for
mission control by remotely monitoring the execution of the tasks. To define
the tasks, we use state machines which support hierarchies and concurrency.
Together with a library concept, even complex scenarios can be handled
gracefully. RAFCON supports sophisticated debugging functionality and tightly
integrates error handling and recovery mechanisms. A GUI with a powerful state
machine editor makes intuitive, visual programming and fast prototyping
possible. We demonstrated the capabilities of our tool in the SpaceBotCamp
national robotic competition, in which our mobile robot solved all exploration
and assembly challenges fully autonomously. It is therefore also a promising
tool for various RoboCup leagues."
"Hessian information speeds convergence substantially in motion optimization.
The better the Hessian approximation the better the convergence. But how good
is a given approximation theoretically? How much are we losing? This paper
addresses that question and proves that for a particularly popular and
empirically strong approximation known as the Gauss-Newton approximation, we
actually lose very little--for a large class of highly expressive objective
terms, the true Hessian actually limits to the Gauss-Newton Hessian quickly as
the trajectory's time discretization becomes small. This result both motivates
it's use and offers insight into computationally efficient design. For
instance, traditional representations of kinetic energy exploit the generalized
inertia matrix whose derivatives are usually difficult to compute. We introduce
here a novel reformulation of rigid body kinetic energy designed explicitly for
fast and accurate curvature calculation. Our theorem proves that the
Gauss-Newton Hessian under this formulation efficiently captures the kinetic
energy curvature, but requires only as much computation as a single evaluation
of the traditional representation. Additionally, we introduce a technique that
exploits these ideas implicitly using Cholesky decompositions for some cases
when similar objective terms reformulations exist but may be difficult to find.
Our experiments validate these findings and demonstrate their use on a
real-world motion optimization system for high-dof motion generation."
"RoboCup soccer competitions are considered among the most challenging
multi-robot adversarial environments, due to their high dynamism and the
partial observability of the environment. In this paper we introduce a method
based on a combination of Monte Carlo search and data aggregation (MCSDA) to
adapt discrete-action soccer policies for a defender robot to the strategy of
the opponent team. By exploiting a simple representation of the domain, a
supervised learning algorithm is trained over an initial collection of data
consisting of several simulations of human expert policies. Monte Carlo policy
rollouts are then generated and aggregated to previous data to improve the
learned policy over multiple epochs and games. The proposed approach has been
extensively tested both on a soccer-dedicated simulator and on real robots.
Using this method, our learning robot soccer team achieves an improvement in
ball interceptions, as well as a reduction in the number of opponents' goals.
Together with a better performance, an overall more efficient positioning of
the whole team within the field is achieved."
"In this paper, we present the probably first application of the popular
\emph{Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)} approach to the domain of
soccer-playing humanoid robots. DMPs are known for their ability to imitate
previously demonstrated motions as well as to flexibly adapt to unforeseen
changes to the desired trajectory with respect to speed and direction. As
demonstrated in this paper, this makes them a useful approach for describing
kick motions. Furthermore, we present a mathematical motor model that
compensates for the NAO robot's motor control delay as well as a novel minor
extension to the DMP formulation. The motor model is used in the calculation of
the Zero Moment Point (ZMP), which is needed to keep the robot in balance while
kicking. All approaches have been evaluated on real NAO robots."
"While a number of excellent review articles on military robots have appeared
in existing literature, this paper focuses on a distinct sub-space of related
problems: small military robots organized into moderately sized squads,
operating in a ground combat environment. Specifically, we consider the
following: - Command of practical small robots, comparable to current
generation, small unmanned ground vehicles (e.g., PackBots) with limited
computing and sensor payload, as opposed to larger vehicle-sized robots or
micro-scale robots; - Utilization of moderately sized practical forces of 3-10
robots applicable to currently envisioned military ground operations; - Complex
three-dimensional physical environments, such as urban areas or mountainous
terrains and the inherent difficulties they impose, including limited and
variable fields of observation, difficult navigation, and intermittent
communication; - Adversarial environments where the active, intelligent enemy
is the key consideration in determining the behavior of the robotic force; and
- Purposeful, partly autonomous, coordinated behaviors that are necessary for
such a robotic force to survive and complete missions; these are far more
complex than, for example, formation control or field coverage behavior."
"To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces
it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing
a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very
challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in
collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are
indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such
motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect
to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their
partner's motion can be captured well through iterative re-planning with the
above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function
which ""explains"" the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example
trajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly
task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost
function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the
human's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively
re-planning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning
algorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer STOMP, it plans for a 23 DoF
human kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator
and obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our
method outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions. We also show that
our method outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a
robot share the workspace."
"In this article, a theoretical justification of one type of skew-symmetric
optimal translational motion (moving in the minimal acceptable time) of a
flexible object carried by a robot from its initial to its final position of
absolute quiescence with the exception of the oscillations at the end of the
motion is presented. The Hamilton-Ostrogradsky principle is used as a criterion
for searching an optimal control. The data of experimental verification of the
control are presented using the Orthoglide robot for translational motions and
several masses were attached to a flexible beam."
"Service robots for the domestic environment are intended to autonomously
provide support for their users. However, state-of-the-art robots still often
get stuck in failure situations leading to breakdowns in the interaction flow
from which the robot cannot recover alone. We performed a multi-user
Wizard-of-Oz experiment in which we manipulated the robot's behavior in such a
way that it appeared unexpected and malfunctioning, and asked participants to
help the robot in order to restore the interaction flow. We examined how
participants reacted to the robot's error, its subsequent request for help and
how it changed their perception of the robot with respect to perceived
intelligence, likability, and task contribution. As interaction scenario we
used a game of building Lego models performed by user dyads. In total 38
participants interacted with the robot and helped in malfunctioning situations.
We report two major findings: (1) in user dyads, the user who gave the last
command followed by the user who is closer is more likely to help (2)
malfunctions that can be actively fixed by the user seem not to negatively
impact perceived intelligence and likability ratings. This work offers insights
in how far user support can be a strategy for domestic service robots to
recover from repeating malfunctions."
"Semantic mapping is the incremental process of ""mapping"" relevant information
of the world (i.e., spatial information, temporal events, agents and actions)
to a formal description supported by a reasoning engine. Current research
focuses on learning the semantic of environments based on their spatial
location, geometry and appearance. Many methods to tackle this problem have
been proposed, but the lack of a uniform representation, as well as standard
benchmarking suites, prevents their direct comparison. In this paper, we
propose a standardization in the representation of semantic maps, by defining
an easily extensible formalism to be used on top of metric maps of the
environments. Based on this, we describe the procedure to build a dataset
(based on real sensor data) for benchmarking semantic mapping techniques, also
hypothesizing some possible evaluation metrics. Nevertheless, by providing a
tool for the construction of a semantic map ground truth, we aim at the
contribution of the scientific community in acquiring data for populating the
dataset."
"The proper handling of 3D orientations is a central element in many
optimization problems in engineering. Unfortunately many researchers and
engineers struggle with the formulation of such problems and often fall back to
suboptimal solutions. The existence of many different conventions further
complicates this issue, especially when interfacing multiple differing
implementations. This document discusses an alternative approach which makes
use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation
between two coordinate systems is primarily identified by the coordinate
mapping it induces. This is combined with the standard exponential map in order
to introduce representation-independent and minimal differentials, which are
very convenient in optimization based methods."
"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)consists in the concurrent
construction of a model of the environment (the map), and the estimation of the
state of the robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing
progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications,
and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey
the current state of SLAM. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto
standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad
set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric
and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees,
active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously
serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By
looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open
challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific
investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that
often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and
Is SLAM solved?"
"A promising approach to autonomous driving is machine learning. In such
systems, training datasets are created that capture the sensory input to a
vehicle as well as the desired response. A disadvantage of using a learned
navigation system is that the learning process itself may require a huge number
of training examples and a large amount of computing. To avoid the need to
collect a large training set of driving examples, we describe a system that
takes advantage of the huge number of training examples provided by ImageNet,
but is able to adapt quickly using a small training set for the specific
driving environment."
"We propose an informative path planning (IPP) algorithm for active
classification using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), focusing on weed
detection in precision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland
using an occupancy grid and generate plans according to information-theoretic
objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We use a combination
of global viewpoint selection and evolutionary optimization to refine the UAV's
trajectory in continuous space while satisfying dynamic constraints. We
validate our approach in simulation by comparing against standard ""lawnmower""
coverage, and study the effects of varying objectives and optimization
strategies. We plan to evaluate our algorithm on a real platform in the
immediate future."
"Behavior trees (BTs) emerged from video game development as a graphical
language for modeling intelligent agent behavior. However as initially
implemented, behavior trees are static plans. This paper adds to recent
literature exploring the ability of BTs to adapt to their success or failure in
achieving tasks. The ""Selector"" node of a BT tries alternative strategies (its
children) and returns success only if all of its children return failure. This
paper studies several means by which Selector nodes can learn from experience,
in particular, learn conditional probabilities of success based on sensor
information, and modify the execution order based on the learned iformation.
Furthermore, a ""Greedy Selector"" is studied which only tries the child having
the highest success probability. Simulation results indicate significantly
increased task performance, especially when frequentist probability estimate is
conditioned on sensor information. The Greedy selector was ineffective unless
it was preceded by a period of training in which all children were exercised."
"Affordances have been introduced in literature as action opportunities that
objects offer, and used in robotics to semantically represent their
interconnection. However, when considering an environment instead of an object,
the problem becomes more complex due to the dynamism of its state. To tackle
this issue, we introduce the concept of Spatio-Temporal Affordances (STA) and
Spatio-Temporal Affordance Map (STAM). Using this formalism, we encode action
semantics related to the environment to improve task execution capabilities of
an autonomous robot. We experimentally validate our approach to support the
execution of robot tasks by showing that affordances encode accurate semantics
of the environment."
"A dataset is crucial for model learning and evaluation. Choosing the right
dataset to use or making a new dataset requires the knowledge of those that are
available. In this work, we provide that knowledge, by reviewing twenty
datasets that were published in the recent six years and that are directly
related to object manipulation. We report on modalities, activities, and
annotations for each individual dataset and give our view on its use for object
manipulation. We also compare the datasets and summarize them. We conclude with
our suggestion on future datasets."
"We consider a problem called task ordering with path uncertainty (TOP-U)
where multiple robots are provided with a set of task locations to visit in a
bounded environment, but the length of the path between a pair of task
locations is initially known only coarsely by the robots. The objective of the
robots is to find the order of tasks that reduces the path length (or, energy
expended) to visit the task locations in such a scenario. To solve this
problem, we propose an abstraction called a task reachability graph (TRG) that
integrates the task ordering with the path planning by the robots. The TRG is
updated dynamically based on inter-task path costs calculated using a
sampling-based motion planner, and, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based technique
that calculates the belief in the current path costs based on the environment
perceived by the robot's sensors and task completion information received from
other robots. We then describe a Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based algorithm
that can select the paths that reduce the overall path length to visit the task
locations and a coordination algorithm that resolves path conflicts between
robots. We have shown analytically that our task selection algorithm finds the
lowest cost path returned by the motion planner, and, that our proposed
coordination algorithm is deadlock free. We have also evaluated our algorithm
on simulated Corobot robots within different environments while varying the
number of task locations, obstacle geometries and number of robots, as well as
on physical Corobot robots. Our results show that the TRG-based approach can
perform considerably better in planning and locomotion times, and number of
re-plans, while traveling almost-similar distances as compared to a closest
first, no uncertainty (CFNU) task selection algorithm."
"The main contribution of this paper is a high frequency, low-complexity,
on-board visual-inertial odometry system for quadrotor micro air vehicles. The
system consists of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimation
algorithm that fuses information from a low cost MEMS inertial measurement unit
acquired at 200Hz and VGA resolution images from a monocular camera at 50Hz.
The dynamic model describing the quadrotor motion is employed in the estimation
algorithm as a third source of information. Visual information is incorporated
into the EKF by enforcing the epipolar constraint on features tracked between
image pairs, avoiding the need to explicitly estimate the location of the
tracked environmental features. Combined use of the dynamic model and epipolar
constraints makes it possible to obtain drift free velocity and attitude
estimates in the presence of both accelerometer and gyroscope biases. A
strategy to deal with the unobservability that arises when the quadrotor is in
hover is also provided. Experimental data from a real-time implementation of
the system on a 50 gram embedded computer are presented in addition to the
simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system."
"In this article, we propose a sampling-based motion planning algorithm
equipped with an information-theoretic convergence criterion for incremental
informative motion planning. The proposed approach allows dense map
representations and incorporates the full state uncertainty into the planning
process. The problem is formulated as a maximization problem with a budget
constraint. Our approach is built on rapidly-exploring information gathering
algorithms and benefits from advantages of sampling-based optimal motion
planning algorithms. We propose two information functions and their variants
for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence
for the entire exploration and information gathering mission based on the least
upper bound of the average map entropy. The convergence criterion gives rise to
a natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control.
We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms using three
scenarios: comparison of the proposed information functions and sensor
configuration selection, robotic exploration in unknown environments, and a
wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake from a publicly available
dataset collected using an autonomous surface vehicle."
"This paper addresses 6-DOF (degree-of-freedom) tactile localization, i.e. the
pose estimation of tridimensional objects given tactile measurements. This
estimation problem is fundamental for the operation of autonomous robots that
are often required to manipulate and grasp objects whose pose is a-priori
unknown. The nature of tactile measurements, the strict time requirements for
real-time operation and the multimodality of the involved probability
distributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear
filtering techniques. Following a Bayesian approach, this paper proposes a
novel and effective algorithm, named Memory Unscented Particle Filter (MUPF),
which solves the 6-DOF localization problem recursively in real-time by only
exploiting contact point measurements. MUPF combines a modified particle filter
that incorporates a sliding memory of past measurements to better handle
multimodal distributions, along with the unscented Kalman filter that moves the
particles towards regions of the search space that are more likely with the
measurements. The performance of the proposed MUPF algorithm has been assessed
both in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors
(i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that the algorithm
provides accurate and reliable localization even with a low number of particles
and, hence, is compatible with real-time requirements."
"This paper proposes a novel method for randomized bin-picking based on
learning. When a two-fingered gripper tries to pick an object from the pile, a
finger often contacts a neighboring object. Even if a finger contacts a
neighboring object, the target object will be successfully picked depending on
the configuration of neighboring objects. In our proposed method, we use the
visual information on neighboring objects to train the discriminator.
Corresponding to a grasping posture of an object, the discriminator predicts
whether or not the pick will be successful even if a finger contacts a
neighboring object. We examine two learning algorithms, the linear support
vector machine (SVM) and the random forest (RF) approaches. By using both
methods, we demonstrate that the picking success rate is significantly higher
than with conventional methods without learning."
"This paper discusses the concept and parameter design of a Robust Stair
Climbing Compliant Modular Robot, capable of tackling stairs with overhangs.
Modifying the geometry of the periphery of the wheels of our robot helps in
tackling overhangs. Along with establishing a concept design, robust design
parameters are set to minimize performance variation. The Grey-based Taguchi
Method is adopted for providing an optimal setting for the design parameters of
the robot. The robot prototype is shown to have successfully scaled stairs of
varying dimensions, with overhang, thus corroborating the analysis performed."
"We employ graph database technology to persistently store and retrieve robot
domain models."
"In this work we present a trajectory Optimization framework for whole-body
motion planning through contacts. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can
be applied to automatically discover different gaits and dynamic motions on a
quadruped robot. In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify
contact switches, timings, points or gait patterns, but they are a direct
outcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics
of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of
the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight
different tasks, which would require very different control structures when
solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization
approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and
without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated
our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that
optimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with
multiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized
trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware."
"We present a novel approach to perform probabilistic collision detection
between a high-DOF robot and high-DOF obstacles in dynamic, uncertain
environments. In dynamic environments with a high-DOF robot and moving
obstacles, our approach efficiently computes accurate collision probability
between the robot and obstacles with upper error bounds. Furthermore, we
describe a prediction algorithm for future obstacle position and motion that
accounts for both spatial and temporal uncertainties. We present a trajectory
optimization algorithm for high-DOF robots in dynamic, uncertain environments
based on probabilistic collision detection. We highlight motion planning
performance in challenging scenarios with robot arms operating in environments
with dynamically moving human obstacles."
"Existing techniques for motion imitation often suffer a certain level of
latency due to their computational overhead or a large set of correspondence
samples to search. To achieve real-time imitation with small latency, we
present a framework in this paper to reconstruct motion on humanoids based on
sparsely sampled correspondence. The imitation problem is formulated as finding
the projection of a point from the configuration space of a human's poses into
the configuration space of a humanoid. An optimal projection is defined as the
one that minimizes a back-projected deviation among a group of candidates,
which can be determined in a very efficient way. Benefited from this
formulation, effective projections can be obtained by using sparse
correspondence. Methods for generating these sparse correspondence samples have
also been introduced. Our method is evaluated by applying the human's motion
captured by a RGB-D sensor to a humanoid in real-time. Continuous motion can be
realized and used in the example application of tele-operation."
"While social robots are developed to provide assistance to users through
social interactions, their behaviors are dominantly pre-programmed and
remote-controlled. Despite the numerous robot control architectures being
developed, very few offer reutilization opportunities in various therapeutic
contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose a robot control architecture to be
applied in different scenarios taking into account requirements from both
therapeutic and robotic perspectives. As robot behaviors are kept at an
abstract level and afterward mapped with the robot's morphology, the proposed
architecture accommodates its applicability to a variety of social robot
platforms."
"Environment perception is a crucial ability for robot's interaction into an
environment. One of the first steps in this direction is the combined problem
of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A new method, called G-SLAM,
is proposed, where the map is considered as a set of scattered points in the
continuous space followed by a probability that states the existence of an
obstacle in the subsequent point in space. A probabilistic approach with
particle filters for the robot's pose estimation and an adaptive recursive
algorithm for the map's probability distribution estimation is presented. Key
feature of the G-SLAM method is the adaptive repositioning of the scattered
points and their convergence around obstacles. In this paper the goal is to
estimate the best robot trajectory along with the probability distribution of
the obstacles in space. For experimental purposes a four wheel rear drive car
kinematic model is used and results derived from real case scenarios are
discussed."
"We address the problem where a mobile search agent seeks to find an unknown
number of stationary objects distributed in a bounded search domain, and the
search mission is subject to time/distance constraint. Our work accounts for
false positives, false negatives and environmental uncertainty. We consider the
case that the performance of a search sensor is dependent on the environment
(e.g., clutter density), and therefore sensor performance is better in some
locations than in others. For applications where environmental information can
be acquired, we derive a decision-theoretic cost function to compute the
locations where the environmental information should be acquired. We address
the cases where environmental characterization is performed either by a
separate vehicle or by the same vehicle that performs the search task."
"The Cloud-based Advanced Robotics Laboratory (CARL) integrates a whole body
controller and web-based teleoperation to enable any device with a web browser
to access and control a humanoid robot. By integrating humanoid robots with the
cloud, they are accessible from any Internet-connected device. Increased
accessibility is important because few people have access to state-of-the-art
humanoid robots limiting their rate of development. CARL's implementation is
based on modern software libraries, frameworks, and middleware including
Node.js, Socket.IO, ZMQ, ROS, Robot Web Tools, and ControlIt! Feasibility is
demonstrated by having inexperienced human operators use a smartphone's
web-browser to control Dreamer, a torque-controlled humanoid robot based on
series elastic actuators, and make it perform a dual-arm manipulation task. The
implementation serves as a proof-of-concept and foundation upon which many
advanced humanoid robot technologies can be researched and developed."
"Field Programmable Gate Arrays(FPGA) exceed the computing power of software
based implementations by breaking the paradigm of sequential execution and
accomplishing more per clock cycle by enabling hardware level parallelization
at an architectural level. Introducing parallel architectures for a
computationally intensive algorithm like Rapidly Exploring Random Trees(RRT)
will result in an exploration that is fast, dense and uniform. Through a cost
function delineated in later sections, FPGA based combinatorial architecture
delivers superlative speed-up but consumes very high power while hierarchical
architecture delivers relatively lower speed-up with acceptable power
consumption levels. To combine the qualities of both, a hybrid architecture,
that encompasses both combinatorial and hierarchical architecture, is designed.
To determine the number of RRT nodes to be allotted to the combinatorial and
hierarchical blocks of the hybrid architecture, a cost function, comprised of
fundamentally inversely related speed-up and power parameters, is formulated.
This maximization of cost function, with its associated constraints,is then
mathematically solved using a modified branch and bound, that leads to optimal
allocation of RRT modules to both blocks. It is observed that this hybrid
architecture delivers the highest performance-per-watt out of the three
architectures for differential, quad-copter and fixed wing kinematics."
"Computing globally optimal motion plans for a robot is challenging in part
because it requires analyzing a robot's configuration space simultaneously from
both a macroscopic viewpoint (i.e., considering paths in multiple homotopic
classes) and a microscopic viewpoint (i.e., locally optimizing path quality).
We introduce Interleaved Optimization with Sampling-based Motion Planning
(IOS-MP), a new method that effectively combines global exploration and local
optimization to quickly compute high quality motion plans. Our approach
combines two paradigms: (1) asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion
planning, which is effective at global exploration but relatively slow at
locally refining paths, and (2) optimization-based motion planning, which
locally optimizes paths quickly but lacks a global view of the configuration
space. IOS-MP iteratively alternates between global exploration and local
optimization, sharing information between the two, to improve motion planning
efficiency. We evaluate IOS-MP as it scales with respect to dimensionality and
complexity, as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-DOF manipulator for
tasks specified using goal configurations and workspace goal regions."
"This technical report presents an introduction to different aspects of
multi-fingered robot grasping. After having introduced relevant mathematical
background for modeling, form and force closure are discussed. Next, we present
an overview of various grasp planning algorithms with the objective of
illustrating different approaches to solve this problem. Finally, we discuss
grasp performance benchmarking."
"Real-time parking occupancy information is valuable for guiding drivers'
searching for parking spaces. Recently many parking detection systems using
range-based on-vehicle sensors are invented, but they disregard the practical
difficulty of obtaining access to raw sensory data which are required for any
feature-based algorithm. In this paper, we focus on a system using short-range
radars (SRR) embedded in Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) to collect
occupancy information, and broadcast it through a connected vehicle network.
The challenge that the data transmitted through ADAS unit has been encoded to
sparse points is overcome by a statistical method instead of feature
extractions. We propose a two-step classification algorithm combining
Mean-Shift clustering and Support Vector Machine to analyze SRR-GPS data, and
evaluate it through field experiments. The results show that the average Type I
error rate for off-street parking is $15.23 \%$ and for on-street parking is
$32.62\%$. In both cased the Type II error rates are less than $20 \%$.
Bayesian updating can recursively improve the mapping results. This paper can
provide a comprehensive method to elevate automotive sensors for the parking
detection function."
"In this paper, we propose a novel inverse Dynamic Reachability Map (iDRM)
that allows a floating base system to find valid end-poses in complex and
dynamically changing environments in real-time. End-pose planning for valid
stance pose and collision-free configuration is an essential problem for
humanoid applications, such as providing goal states for walking and motion
planners. However, this is non-trivial in complex environments, where standing
locations and reaching postures are restricted by obstacles. Our proposed iDRM
customizes the robot-to-workspace occupation list and uses an online update
algorithm to enable efficient reconstruction of the reachability map to
guarantee that the selected end-poses are always collision-free. The iDRM was
evaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF)
humanoid robot Valkyrie. Our results show that the approach is capable of
finding valid end-poses in a fraction of a second. Significantly, we also
demonstrate that motion planning algorithms integrating our end-pose planning
method are more efficient than those not utilizing this technique."
"In this paper we present the PUMP (Parallel Uncertainty-aware Multiobjective
Planning) algorithm for addressing the stochastic kinodynamic motion planning
problem, whereby one seeks a low-cost, dynamically-feasible motion plan subject
to a constraint on collision probability (CP). To ensure exhaustive evaluation
of candidate motion plans (as needed to tradeoff the competing objectives of
performance and safety), PUMP incrementally builds the Pareto front of the
problem, accounting for the optimization objective and an approximation of CP.
This is performed by a massively parallel multiobjective search, here
implemented with a focus on GPUs. Upon termination of the exploration phase,
PUMP searches the Pareto set of motion plans to identify the lowest cost
solution that is certified to satisfy the CP constraint (according to an
asymptotically exact estimator). We introduce a novel particle-based CP
approximation scheme, designed for efficient GPU implementation, which accounts
for dependencies over the history of a trajectory execution. We present
numerical experiments for quadrotor planning wherein PUMP identifies solutions
in ~100 ms, evaluating over one hundred thousand partial plans through the
course of its exploration phase. The results show that this multiobjective
search achieves a lower motion plan cost, for the same CP constraint, compared
to a safety buffer-based search heuristic and repeated RRT trials."
"A resolution complete optimal kinodynamic motion planning algorithm is
presented and described as a generalized label correcting (GLC) method. In
contrast to related algorithms, the GLC method does not require a local
planning subroutine and benefits from a simple implementation. The key
contributions of this paper are the construction and analysis of the GLC
conditions which are the basis of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the running time of the GLC method to be less than the related SST
algorithm."
"Planning balanced and collision-free motion for humanoid robots is
non-trivial, especially when they are operated in complex environments, such as
reaching targets behind obstacles or through narrow passages. We propose a
method that allows us to apply existing sampling--based algorithms to plan
trajectories for humanoids by utilizing a customized state space
representation, biased sampling strategies, and a steering function based on a
robust inverse kinematics solver. Our approach requires no prior offline
computation, thus one can easily transfer the work to new robot platforms. We
tested the proposed method solving practical reaching tasks on a 38
degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot, NASA Valkyrie, showing that our method is
able to generate valid motion plans that can be executed on advanced full-size
humanoid robots. We also present a benchmark between different motion planning
algorithms evaluated on a variety of reaching motion problems. This allows us
to find suitable algorithms for solving humanoid motion planning problems, and
to identify the limitations of these algorithms."
"We present a novel approach for collision-free global navigation for
continuous-time multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics. Our approach
is general and can be used to perform collision-free navigation in 2D and 3D
workspaces with narrow passages and crowded regions. As part of
pre-computation, we compute multiple bridges in the narrow or tight regions in
the workspace using kinodynamic RRT algorithms. Our bridge has certain
geometric characteristics, that en- able us to calculate a collision-free
trajectory for each agent using simple interpolation at runtime. Moreover, we
combine interpolated bridge trajectories with local multi-agent navigation
algorithms to compute global collision-free paths for each agent. The overall
approach combines the performance benefits of coupled multi-agent algorithms
with the pre- computed trajectories of the bridges to handle challenging
scenarios. In practice, our approach can handle tens to hundreds of agents in
real-time on a single CPU core in 2D and 3D workspaces."
"The function of protein, RNA, and DNA is modulated by fast, dynamic exchanges
between three-dimensional conformations. Conformational sampling of
biomolecules with exact and nullspace inverse kinematics, using rotatable bonds
as revolute joints and non-covalent interactions as holonomic constraints, can
accurately characterize these native ensembles. However, sampling biomolecules
remains challenging owing to their ultra-high dimensional configuration spaces,
and the requirement to avoid (self-) collisions, which results in low
acceptance rates.
  Here, we present two novel mechanisms to overcome these limitations. First,
we introduced temporary constraints between near-colliding links. The resulting
constraint varieties instantaneously redirect the search for collision-free
conformations, and couple motions between distant parts of the linkage. Second,
we adapted a randomized Poisson-disk motion planner, which prevents local
oversampling and widens the search, to ultra-high dimensions. We evaluated our
algorithm on several model systems. Our contributions apply to general
high-dimensional motion planning problems in static and dynamic environments
with obstacles."
"Effective SLAM using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its
simplicity. However, when compared to trajectory planning methods using
depth-based SLAM, Monocular SLAM in loop does need additional considerations.
One main reason being that for the optimization, in the form of Bundle
Adjustment (BA), to be robust, the SLAM system needs to scan the area for a
reasonable duration. Most monocular SLAM systems do not tolerate large camera
rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown. Other reasons for
Monocular SLAM failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the Essential
Matrix, feature-sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart
from BA. This paper presents a novel formulation based on Reinforcement
Learning (RL) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the SLAM generated
outputs (scene structure and camera motion) do not deviate largely from their
true values. Quintessentially, the RL framework successfully learns the
otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that
result in trajectories that do not cause failure of SLAM, which are almost
intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation. We show
systematically in simulations how the quality of the SLAM map and trajectory
dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using RL."
"We present a method for humanoid robot walking on partial footholds such as
small stepping stones and rocks with sharp surfaces. Our algorithm does not
rely on prior knowledge of the foothold, but information about an expected
foothold can be used to improve the stepping performance. After a step is
taken, the robot explores the new contact surface by attempting to shift the
center of pressure around the foot. The available foothold is inferred by the
way in which the foot rotates about contact edges and/or by the achieved center
of pressure locations on the foot during exploration. This estimated contact
area is then used by a whole body momentum-based control algorithm. To walk and
balance on partial footholds, we combine fast, dynamic stepping with the use of
upper body angular momentum to regain balance. We applied this method to the
Atlas humanoid designed by Boston Dynamics to walk over small contact surfaces,
such as line and point contacts. We present experimental results and discuss
performance limitations."
"Robotic ultrasound has the potential to assist and guide physicians during
interventions. In this work, we present a set of methods and a workflow to
enable autonomous MRI-guided ultrasound acquisitions. Our approach uses a
structured-light 3D scanner for patient-to-robot and image-to-patient
calibration, which in turn is used to plan 3D ultrasound trajectories. These
MRI-based trajectories are followed autonomously by the robot and are further
refined online using automatic MRI/US registration. Despite the low spatial
resolution of structured light scanners, the initial planned acquisition path
can be followed with an accuracy of 2.46 +/- 0.96 mm. This leads to a good
initialization of the MRI/US registration: the 3D-scan-based alignment for
planning and acquisition shows an accuracy (distance between planned ultrasound
and MRI) of 4.47 mm, and 0.97 mm after an online-update of the calibration
based on a closed loop registration."
"The humanoid robot iCub is a research platform of the Fondazione Istituto
Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), spread among different institutes around the
world. In the most recent version of iCub, the robot is equipped with stronger
legs and bigger feet, allowing it to perform balancing and walking motions that
were not possible with the first generations. Despite the new legs hardware,
walking has been rarely performed on the iCub robot. In this work the objective
is to implement walking motions on the robot, from which we want to analyze its
walking capabilities. We developed software modules based on extensions of
classic techniques such as the ZMP based pattern generator and position control
to identify which are the characteristics as well as limitations of the robot
against different walking tasks in order to give the users a reference of the
performance of the robot. Most of the experiments have been performed with
HeiCub, a reduced version of iCub without arms and head."
"Linear models for control and motion generation of humanoid robots have
received significant attention in the past years, not only due to their well
known theoretical guarantees, but also because of practical computational
advantages. However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as
locomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this
paper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization
based on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex;
however, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as
a single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be
very efficiently optimized. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that this
relaxation is tight and therefore useful for multi-contact planning. This
convex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contacts
location using a mixed integer program, which can be solved in realtime. This
becomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined
stepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact
location is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several
multi-contact scenarios for humanoid robot."
"We present a multi-contact walking pattern generator based on preview-control
of the 3D acceleration of the center of mass (COM). A key point in the design
of our algorithm is the calculation of contact-stability constraints. Thanks to
a mathematical observation on the algebraic nature of the frictional wrench
cone, we show that the 3D volume of feasible COM accelerations is a always a
downward-pointing cone. We reduce its computation to a convex hull of (dual) 2D
points, for which optimal O(n log n) algorithms are readily available. This
reformulation brings a significant speedup compared to previous methods, which
allows us to compute time-varying contact-stability criteria fast enough for
the control loop. Next, we propose a conservative trajectory-wide
contact-stability criterion, which can be derived from COM-acceleration volumes
at marginal cost and directly applied in a model-predictive controller. We
finally implement this pipeline and exemplify it with the HRP-4 humanoid model
in multi-contact dynamically walking scenarios."
"It has long been hoped that model-based control will improve tracking
performance while maintaining or increasing compliance. This hope hinges on
having or being able to estimate an accurate inverse dynamics model. As a
result, substantial effort has gone into modeling and estimating dynamics
(error) models. Most recent research has focused on learning the true inverse
dynamics using data points mapping observed accelerations to the torques used
to generate them. Unfortunately, if the initial tracking error is bad, such
learning processes may train substantially off-distribution to predict well on
actual observed acceleration rather then the desired accelerations. This work
takes a different approach. We define a class of gradient-based online learning
algorithms we term Direct Online Optimization for Modeling Errors in Dynamics
(DOOMED) that directly minimize an objective measuring the divergence between
actual and desired accelerations. Our objective is defined in terms of the true
system's unknown dynamics and is therefore impossible to evaluate. However, we
show that its gradient is measurable online from system data. We develop a
novel adaptive control approach based on running online learning to directly
correct (inverse) dynamics errors in real time using the data stream from the
robot to accurately achieve desired accelerations during execution."
"This paper proposes a iterative visual recognition system for learning based
randomized bin-picking. Since the configuration on randomly stacked objects
while executing the current picking trial is just partially different from the
configuration while executing the previous picking trial, we consider detecting
the poses of objects just by using a part of visual image taken at the current
picking trial where it is different from the visual image taken at the previous
picking trial. By using this method, we do not need to try to detect the poses
of all objects included in the pile at every picking trial. Assuming the 3D
vision sensor attached at the wrist of a manipulator, we first explain a method
to determine the pose of a 3D vision sensor maximizing the visibility of
randomly stacked objects. Then, we explain a method for detecting the poses of
randomly stacked objects. Effectiveness of our proposed approach is confirmed
by experiments using a dual-arm manipulator where a 3D vision sensor and the
two-fingered hand attached at the right and the left wrists, respectively."
"This paper reports a partially decentralized implementation of an Extended
Kalman filter for the cooperative localization of a team of mobile robots with
limited onboard resources. Unlike a fully centralized scheme that requires, at
each timestep, information from the entire team to be gathered together and be
processed by a single device, our algorithm only requires that the robots
communicate with a central command unit at the time of a measurement update.
Every robot only needs to propagate and update its own state estimate, while
the central command unit maintains track of cross-covariances. Therefore, the
computational and storage cost per robot in terms of the size of the team is of
order O(1). Moreover, when the system model is linear the algorithm is robust
to occasional in-network communication link failures while the updated
estimates of the robots receiving the update message are of minimum variance at
that given timestep. For problems with nonlinear robot models, our algorithm
under message drop-out provides a suboptimal solutions because of the
linearization approximation similar to the Extended Kalman filter model. We
demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in simulation."
"Mobile manipulation problems involving many objects are challenging to solve
due to the high dimensionality and multi-modality of their hybrid configuration
spaces. Planners that perform a purely geometric search are prohibitively slow
for solving these problems because they are unable to factor the configuration
space. Symbolic task planners can efficiently construct plans involving many
variables but cannot represent the geometric and kinematic constraints required
in manipulation. We present the FFRob algorithm for solving task and motion
planning problems. First, we introduce Extended Action Specification (EAS) as a
general purpose planning representation that supports arbitrary predicates as
conditions. We adapt heuristic search ideas for solving \proc{strips} planning
problems, particularly delete-relaxations, to solve EAS problem instances. We
then apply the EAS representation and planners to manipulation problems
resulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion planning
problems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a multi-query
roadmap structure that can be conditionalized to evaluate reachability under
different placements of movable objects. This structure enables the EAS planner
to efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate geometric and kinematic
planning constraints to give a tight estimate of the distance to the goal.
Additionally, we show FFRob is probabilistically complete and has finite
expected runtime. Finally, we empirically demonstrate FFRob's effectiveness on
complex and diverse task and motion planning tasks including rearrangement
planning and navigation among movable objects."
"The motion of robots and objects in our world is often highly dependent upon
contact. When contact is expected but does not occur or when contact is not
expected but does occur, robot behavior diverges from plan, often disastrously.
This paper describes an approach that uses simulation to detect possible such
behavioral divergences on real robots. This approach, and others like it, could
be applied to validation of robot behaviors, mechanism design, and even online
planning.
  The particle trace approach samples robot modeling parameters, sensory
readings, and state estimates to evaluate a robot's behavior statistically over
a range of conditions. We demonstrate that combining even coarse estimates of
state and modeling parameters with fast multibody simulation can be sufficient
to detect divergent robot behavior and characterize robot performance in the
real world. Correspondingly, this approach could be used to assess risk and
find and analyze likely failures, given the extensive data that such
simulations can generate.
  We assess this approach on actuated, high degree-of-freedom robot locomotion
examples, a picking task with a fixed-base manipulator, and an unpowered
passive dynamic walker. This research works toward understanding how
multi-rigid body simulations can better characterize the behavior of robots
without significantly compliant elements."
"Planning of any motion starts by planning the trajectory of the CoM. It is of
the highest importance to ensure that the robot will be able to perform planned
trajectory. With increasing capabilities of the humanoid robots, the case when
contacts are spatially distributed should be considered. In this paper, it is
shown that there are some contact configurations in which any acceleration of
the center of mass (CoM) is feasible. The procedure for identifying such a
configurations is presented, as well as its physical meaning. On the other
hand, for the configurations in which the constraint on CoM movement exists, it
will be shown how to find that linear constraint, which defines the space of
feasible motion. The proposed algorithm has a low complexity and to speed up
the procedure even further, it will be shown that the whole procedure needs to
be run only once when contact configuration changes. As the CoM moves, the new
constraints can be calculated from the initial one, thus yielding significant
computation speedup. The methods are illustrated in two simulated scenarios."
"An effective paradigm for simulating the dynamics of robots that locomote and
manipulate is multi-rigid body simulation with rigid contact. This paradigm
provides reasonable tradeoffs between accuracy, running time, and simplicity of
parameter selection and identification. The Stewart-Trinkle/Anitescu-Potra time
stepping approach is the basis of many existing implementations. It
successfully treats inconsistent (Painleve-type) contact configurations,
efficiently handles many contact events occurring in short time intervals, and
provably converges to the solution of the continuous time differential
algebraic equations (DAEs) as the integration step size tends to zero. However,
there is currently no means to determine when the solution has largely
converged, i.e., when smaller integration steps would result in only small
increases in accuracy.
  The present work describes an approach that computes the event times (when
the set of active equations in a DAE changes) of all contact/impact events for
a multi-body simulation, toward using integration techniques with error control
to compute a solution with desired accuracy.
  We also describe a first-order, variable integration approach that ensures
that rigid bodies with convex polytopic geometries never interpenetrate. This
approach permits taking large steps when possible and takes small steps when
contact is complex."
"Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a well-known estimation method used in
many robotic and computer vision applications. Under Gaussian assumption, the
MLE converts to a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. Efficient solutions to
NLS exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until
convergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of
the mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too
expensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localisation and
mapping (SLAM) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data
association, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next
best view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance
recovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general
performed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step
and its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may
become highly computationally demanding. This paper introduces a general
framework for incremental MLE called SLAM++, which fully benefits from the
incremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient
estimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that,
we propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state
representation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures
to integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state
representation. SLAM++ differs from existing implementations by performing all
the matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation
and arithmetic operations. Even though this paper tests SLAM++ efficiency on
SLAM problems, its applicability remains general."
"This paper presents a mid-level planning system for object reorientation. It
includes a grasp planner, a placement planner, and a regrasp sequence solver.
Given the initial and goal poses of an object, the mid-level planning system
finds a sequence of hand configurations that reorient the object from the
initial to the goal. This mid-level planning system is open to low-level motion
planning algorithm by providing two end-effector poses as the input. It is also
open to high-level symbolic planners by providing interface functions like
placing an object to a given position at a given rotation. The planning system
is demonstrated with several simulation examples and real-robot executions
using a Kawada Hiro robot and Robotiq 85 grippers."
"This paper exhibits a short-run correspondence method appropriate for swarm
versatile robots application. Infrared is utilized for transmitting and
accepting information and obstruction location. The infrared correspondence
code based swarm signaling is utilized for an independent versatile robot
communication system in this research. A code based signaling system is
developed for transmitting information between different entities of robot. The
reflected infrared sign is additionally utilized for separation estimation for
obstruction evasion. Investigation of robot demonstrates the possibility of
utilizing infrared signs to get a solid nearby correspondence between swarm
portable robots. This paper exhibits a basic decentralized control for swarm of
self-collecting robots. Every robot in the code based swarm signaling is
completely self-governing and controlled utilizing a conduct based methodology
with just infrared-based nearby detecting and correspondences. The viability of
the methodology has been checked with simulation, for a set of swarm robots."
"Occupancy grids are the most common framework when it comes to creating a map
of the environment using a robot. This paper studies occupancy grids from the
motion planning perspective and proposes a mapping method that provides richer
data (map) for the purpose of planning and collision avoidance. Typically, in
occupancy grid mapping, each cell contains a single number representing the
probability of cell being occupied. This leads to conflicts in the map, and
more importantly inconsistency between the map error and reported confidence
values. Such inconsistencies pose challenges for the planner that relies on the
generated map for planning motions. In this work, we store a richer data at
each voxel including an accurate estimate of the variance of occupancy. We show
that in addition to achieving maps that are often more accurate than tradition
methods, the proposed filtering scheme demonstrates a much higher level of
consistency between its error and its reported confidence. This allows the
planner to reason about acquisition of the future sensory information. Such
planning can lead to active perception maneuvers that while guiding the robot
toward the goal aims at increasing the confidence in parts of the map that are
relevant to accomplishing the task."
"We present a motion planning algorithm to compute collision-free and smooth
trajectories for high-DOF robots interacting with humans in a shared workspace.
Our approach uses offline learning of human actions along with temporal
coherence to predict the human actions. Our intention-aware online planning
algorithm uses the learned database to compute a reliable trajectory based on
the predicted actions. We represent the predicted human motion using a Gaussian
distribution and compute tight upper bounds on collision probabilities for safe
motion planning. We highlight the performance of our planning algorithm in
complex simulated scenarios and real world benchmarks with 7-DOF robot arms
operating in a workspace with a human performing complex tasks. We demonstrate
the benefits of our intention-aware planner in terms of computing safe
trajectories in such uncertain environments."
"This paper presents an extension of the OpenAI Gym for robotics using the
Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Gazebo simulator. The content discusses
the software architecture proposed and the results obtained by using two
Reinforcement Learning techniques: Q-Learning and Sarsa. Ultimately, the output
of this work presents a benchmarking system for robotics that allows different
techniques and algorithms to be compared using the same virtual conditions."
"We present Probabilistic Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle or PRVO as a general
algorithm for navigating multiple robots under perception and motion
uncertainty. PRVO is defined as the space of velocities that ensures dynamic
collision avoidance between a pair of robots with a specified probability. Our
approach is based on defining chance constraints over the inequalities defined
by the deterministic Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle (RVO). The computational
complexity of the proposed probabilistic RVO is comparable to the deterministic
counterpart. This is achieved by a series of reformulations where we first
substitute the computationally intractable chance constraints with a family of
surrogate constraints and then adopt a time scaling based solution methodology
to efficiently characterize their solution space. Further, we also show that
the solution space of each member of the family of surrogate constraints can be
mapped in closed form to the probability with which the original chance
constraints are satisfied and thus consequently to probability of collision
avoidance. We validate our formulations through numerical simulations where we
highlight the importance of incorporating the effect of motion uncertainty and
the advantages of PRVO over existing formulations which handles the effect of
uncertainty by using conservative bounding volumes."
"This paper demonstrates the ability of the harmonic potential field, HPF,
planning method to generate a well-behaved constrained path for a robot with
second order dynamics in a cluttered environment. It is shown that HPF-based
controllers may be developed for holonomic as well as nonholonomic robots to
effectively suppress the effect of inertial forces on the robot trajectory
while maintaining all the attractive features of a purely kinematic HPF
planner. The capabilities of the suggested navigation controller are
demonstrated using simulation results. Comparisons are also supplied with other
approaches used for converting the guidance signal from a purely kinematic HPF
planner into a navigation control signal."
"This paper proposes control laws ensuring the stabilization of a time-varying
desired joint trajectory, as well as joint limit avoidance, in the case of
fully-actuated manipulators. The key idea is to perform a parametrization of
the feasible joint space in terms of exogenous states. It follows that the
control of these states allows for joint limit avoidance. One of the main
outcomes of this paper is that position terms in control laws are replaced by
parametrized terms, where joint limits must be avoided. Stability and
convergence of time-varying reference trajectories obtained with the proposed
method are demonstrated to be in the sense of Lyapunov. The introduced control
laws are verified by carrying out experiments on two degrees-of-freedom of the
humanoid robot iCub."
"We study the problem of simultaneously reconstructing a polygonal room and a
trajectory of a device equipped with a (nearly) collocated omnidirectional
source and receiver. The device measures arrival times of echoes of pulses
emitted by the source and picked up by the receiver. No prior knowledge about
the device's trajectory is required. Most existing approaches addressing this
problem assume multiple sources or receivers, or they assume that some of these
are static, serving as beacons. Unlike earlier approaches, we take into account
the measurement noise and various constraints on the geometry by formulating
the solution as a minimizer of a cost function similar to \emph{stress} in
multidimensional scaling. We study uniqueness of the reconstruction from
first-order echoes, and we show that in addition to the usual invariance to
rigid motions, new ambiguities arise for important classes of rooms and
trajectories. We support our theoretical developments with a number of
numerical experiments."
"If autonomous vehicles are to be widely accepted, we need to ensure their
safe operation. For this reason, verification and validation (V&V) approaches
must be developed that are suitable for this domain. Model checking is a formal
technique which allows us to exhaustively explore the paths of an abstract
model of a system. Using a probabilistic model checker such as PRISM, we may
determine properties such as the expected time for a mission, or the
probability that a specific mission failure occurs. However, model checking of
complex systems is difficult due to the loss of information during abstraction.
This is especially so when considering systems such as autonomous vehicles
which are subject to external influences. An alternative solution is the use of
Monte Carlo simulation to explore the results of a continuous-time model of the
system. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the approach is not
exhaustive as not all executions of the system are analysed. We are therefore
interested in developing a framework for formal verification of autonomous
vehicles, using Monte Carlo simulation to inform and validate our symbolic
models during the initial stages of development. In this paper, we present a
continuous-time model of a quadrotor unmanned aircraft undertaking an
autonomous mission. We employ this model in Monte Carlo simulation to obtain
specific mission properties which will inform the symbolic models employed in
formal verification."
"Consider a swarm of particles controlled by global inputs. This paper
presents algorithms for shaping such swarms in 2D using boundary walls. The
range of configurations created by conforming a swarm to a boundary wall is
limited. We describe the set of stable configurations of a swarm in two
canonical workspaces, a circle and a square. To increase the diversity of
configurations, we add boundary interaction to our model. We provide algorithms
using friction with walls to place two robots at arbitrary locations in a
rectangular workspace. Next, we extend this algorithm to place $n$ agents at
desired locations. We conclude with efficient techniques to control the
covariance of a swarm not possible without wall-friction. Simulations and
hardware implementations with 100 robots validate these results.
  These methods may have particular relevance for current micro- and
nano-robots controlled by global inputs."
"A new path planning method for Mobile Robots (MR) has been developed and
implemented. On the one hand, based on the shortest path from the start point
to the goal point, this path planner can choose the best moving directions of
the MR, which helps to reach the target point as soon as possible. On the other
hand, with an intelligent obstacle avoidance, our method can find the target
point with the near-shortest path length while avoiding some infinite loop
traps of several obstacles in unknown environments. The combination of two
approaches helps the MR to reach the target point with a very reliable
algorithm. Moreover, by continuous updates of the on-board sensors information,
this approach can generate the MRs trajectory both in static and dynamic
environments. A large number of simulations in some similar studies
environments demonstrate the power of the proposed path planning algorithm."
"In the classical context of robotic mapping and localization, map matching is
typically defined as the task of finding a rigid transformation (i.e., 3DOF
rotation/translation on the 2D moving plane) that aligns the query and
reference maps built by mobile robots. This definition is valid in loop-rich
trajectories that enable a mapper robot to close many loops, for which precise
maps can be assumed. The same cannot be said about the newly emerging
autonomous navigation and driving systems, which typically operate in loop-less
trajectories that have no large loop (e.g., straight paths). In this paper, we
propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by merging the two maps. Our
study is motivated by the observation that even when there is no large loop in
either the query or reference map, many loops can often be obtained in the
merged map. We add two new aspects to map matching: (1) image retrieval with
discriminative deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, which
efficiently generates a small number of good initial alignment hypotheses; and
(2) map merge, which jointly deforms the two maps to minimize differences in
shape between them. To realize practical computation time, we also present a
preemption scheme that avoids excessive evaluation of useless map-matching
hypotheses. To verify our approach experimentally, we created a novel
collection of uncertain loop-less maps by utilizing the recently published
North Campus Long-Term (NCLT) dataset and its ground-truth GPS data. The
results obtained using these map collections confirm that our approach improves
on previous map-matching approaches."
"In order to deal with the scaling problem of volumetric map representations
we propose spatially local methods for high-ratio compression of 3D maps,
represented as truncated signed distance fields. We show that these compressed
maps can be used as meaningful descriptors for selective decompression in
scenarios relevant to robotic applications. As compression methods, we compare
using PCA-derived low-dimensional bases to non-linear auto-encoder networks and
novel mixed architectures that combine both. Selecting two application-oriented
performance metrics, we evaluate the impact of different compression rates on
reconstruction fidelity as well as to the task of map-aided ego-motion
estimation. It is demonstrated that lossily compressed distance fields used as
cost functions for ego-motion estimation, can outperform their uncompressed
counterparts in challenging scenarios from standard RGB-D data-sets."
"We present an efficient variational integrator for multibody systems.
Variational integrators reformulate the equations of motion for multibody
systems as discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations, transforming forward
integration into a root-finding problem for the DEL equations. Variational
integrators have been shown to be more robust and accurate in preserving
fundamental properties of systems, such as momentum and energy, than many
frequently used numerical integrators. However, state-of-the-art algorithms
suffer from $O(n^3)$ complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody
systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, $n$, in generalized
coordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a recursive algorithm that
evaluates DEL equations in $O(n)$, which scales up well for complex multibody
systems such as humanoid robots. Inspired by recursive Newton-Euler algorithm,
our key insight is to formulate DEL equation individually for each body rather
than for the entire system. Furthermore, we introduce a new quasi-Newton method
that exploits the impulse-based dynamics algorithm, which is also $O(n)$, to
avoid the expensive Jacobian inversion in solving DEL equations. We demonstrate
scalability and efficiency, as well as extensibility to holonomic constraints
through several case studies."
"Robots are becoming ever more autonomous. This expanding ability to take
unsupervised decisions renders it imperative that mechanisms are in place to
guarantee the safety of behaviours executed by the robot. Moreover, smart
autonomous robots should be more than safe; they should also be explicitly
ethical -- able to both choose and justify actions that prevent harm. Indeed,
as the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities of robots expand, they will
be expected to have an improved capacity for making moral judgements. We
present a control architecture that supplements existing robot controllers.
This so-called Ethical Layer ensures robots behave according to a predetermined
set of ethical rules by predicting the outcomes of possible actions and
evaluating the predicted outcomes against those rules. To validate the proposed
architecture, we implement it on a humanoid robot so that it behaves according
to Asimov's laws of robotics. In a series of four experiments, using a second
humanoid robot as a proxy for the human, we demonstrate that the proposed
Ethical Layer enables the robot to prevent the human from coming to harm."
"Guided policy search is a method for reinforcement learning that trains a
general policy for accomplishing a given task by guiding the learning of the
policy with multiple guiding distributions. Guided policy search relies on
learning an underlying dynamical model of the environment and then, at each
iteration of the algorithm, using that model to gradually improve the policy.
This model, though, often makes the assumption that the environment dynamics
are markovian, e.g., depend only on the current state and control signal. In
this paper we apply guided policy search to a problem with non-markovian
dynamics. Specifically, we apply it to the problem of pouring a precise amount
of liquid from a cup into a bowl, where many of the sensor measurements
experience non-trivial amounts of delay. We show that, with relatively simple
state augmentation, guided policy search can be extended to non-markovian
dynamical systems, where the non-markovianess is caused by delayed sensor
readings."
"This work contributes to a compositional theory of ""co-design"" that allows to
optimally design a robotic platform. In this framework, the user describes each
subsystem as a monotone relation between ""functionality"" provided and
""resources"" required. These models can be easily composed to express the
co-design constraints among different subsystems. The user then queries the
model, to obtain the design with minimal resources usage, subject to a lower
bound on the provided functionality. This paper concerns the introduction of
uncertainty in the framework. Uncertainty has two roles: first, it allows to
deal with limited knowledge of the models; second, it also can be used to
generate consistent relaxations of a problem, as the computation requirements
can be lowered, should the user accept some uncertainty in the answer."
"This paper develops a planner to find an optimal assembly sequence to
assemble several objects. The input to the planner is the mesh models of the
objects, the relative poses between the objects in the assembly, and the final
pose of the assembly. The output is an optimal assembly sequence, namely (1) in
which order should one assemble the objects, (2) from which directions should
the objects be dropped, and (3) candidate grasps of each object. The proposed
planner finds the optimal solution by automatically permuting, evaluating, and
searching the possible assembly sequences considering stability, graspability,
and assemblability qualities. It is expected to guide robots to do assembly
using translational motion. The output provides initial and goal configurations
to motion planning algorithms. It is ready to be used by robots and is
demonstrated using several simulations and real-world executions."
"We present a novel motion planning algorithm for transferring a liquid body
from a source to a target container. Our approach uses a receding-horizon
optimization strategy that takes into account fluid constraints and avoids
collisions. In order to efficiently handle the high-dimensional configuration
space of a liquid body, we use system identification to learn its dynamics
characteristics using a neural network. We generate the training dataset using
stochastic optimization in a transfer-problem-specific search space. The
runtime feedback motion planner is used for real-time planning and we observe
high success rate in our simulated 2D and 3D fluid transfer benchmarks."
"When limbs are decoupled, we find that trajectory outcomes in mechanical
systems subject to unilateral constraints vary differentiably with respect to
initial conditions, even as the contact mode sequence varies."
"The necessity of maintaining a robust antiterrorist task force has become
imperative in recent times with resurgence of rogue element in the society. A
well equipped combat force warrants the safety and security of citizens and the
integrity of the sovereign state. In this paper we propose a novel
teleoperating robot which can play a major role in combat, rescue and
reconnaissance missions by substantially reducing loss of human soldiers in
such hostile environments. The proposed robotic solution consists of an
unmanned ground vehicle equipped with an IP camera visual system broadcasting
real-time video data to a remote cloud server. With the advancement in machine
learning algorithms in the field of computer vision, we incorporate state of
the art deep convolutional neural networks to identify and predict individuals
with malevolent intent. The classification is performed on every frame of the
video stream by the trained network in the cloud server. The predicted output
of the network is overlaid on the video stream with specific colour marks and
prediction percentage. Finally the data is resized into half-side by side
format and streamed to the head mount display worn by the human controller
which facilitates first person view of the scenario. The ground vehicle is also
coupled with an unmanned aerial vehicle for aerial surveillance. The proposed
scheme is an assistive system and the final decision evidently lies with the
human handler."
"We propose a new parallel framework for fast computation of inverse and
forward dynamics of articulated robots based on prefix sums (scans). We
re-investigate the well-known recursive Newton-Euler formulation of robot
dynamics and show that the forward-backward propagation process for robot
inverse dynamics is equivalent to two scan operations on certain semigroups. We
show that the state-of-the-art forward dynamics algorithms may almost
completely be cast into a sequence of scan operations, with unscannable parts
clearly identified. This suggests a serial-parallel hybrid approach for systems
with a moderate number of links. We implement our scan based algorithms on
Nvidia CUDA platform with performance compared with multithreading CPU-based
recursive algorithms; a significant level of acceleration is demonstrated."
"We present a model predictive controller (MPC) for multi-contact locomotion
where predictive optimizations are realized by time-optimal path
parameterization (TOPP). A key feature of this solution is that, contrary to
existing planners where step timings are provided as inputs, here the timing
between contact switches is computed as output of a fast nonlinear
optimization. This is particularly appealing to multi-contact locomotion, where
proper timings depend on terrain topology and suitable heuristics are unknown.
We show how to formulate legged locomotion as a TOPP problem and demonstrate
the behavior of the resulting TOPP-MPC controller in simulations with a model
of the HRP-4 humanoid robot."
"This paper describes the Robotarium -- a remotely accessible, multi-robot
research facility. The impetus behind the Robotarium is that multi-robot
testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the multi-robot research
cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming to develop, operate,
and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit access for large
groups of researchers and students, which is what the Robotarium is remedying
by providing users with remote access to a state-of-the-art multi-robot test
facility. This paper details the design and operation of the Robotarium and
discusses the considerations one must take when making complex hardware
remotely accessible. In particular, safety must be built into the system
already at the design phase without overly constraining what coordinated
control programs users can upload and execute, which calls for minimally
invasive safety routines with provable performance guarantees."
"In this paper we present a novel dataset for a critical aspect of autonomous
driving, the joint attention that must occur between drivers and of
pedestrians, cyclists or other drivers. This dataset is produced with the
intention of demonstrating the behavioral variability of traffic participants.
We also show how visual complexity of the behaviors and scene understanding is
affected by various factors such as different weather conditions, geographical
locations, traffic and demographics of the people involved. The ground truth
data conveys information regarding the location of participants (bounding
boxes), the physical conditions (e.g. lighting and speed) and the behavior of
the parties involved."
"microMVP is an affordable, portable, and open source micro-scale mobile robot
platform designed for robotics research and education. As a complete and unique
multi-vehicle platform enabled by 3D printing and the maker culture, microMVP
can be easily reproduced and requires little maintenance: a set of six micro
vehicles, each measuring $8\times 5\times 6$ cubic centimeters and weighing
under $100$ grams, and the accompanying tracking platform can be fully
assembled in under two hours, all from readily available components. In this
paper, we describe microMVP's hardware and software architecture, and the
design thoughts that go into the making of the platform. The capabilities of
microMVP APIs are then demonstrated with several single- and multi-robot path
and motion planning algorithms. microMVP supports all common operation systems."
"Localization in a global map is critical to success in many autonomous robot
missions. This is particularly challenging for multi-robot operations in
unknown and adverse environments. Here, we are concerned with providing a small
unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) the ability to localize itself within a 2.5D
aerial map generated from imagery captured by a low-flying unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV). We consider the scenario where GPS is unavailable and
appearance-based scene changes may have occurred between the UAV's flight and
the start of the UGV's mission. We present a GPS-free solution to this
localization problem that is robust to appearance shifts by exploiting
high-level, semantic representations of image and depth data. Using data
gathered at an urban test site, we empirically demonstrate that our technique
yields results within five meters of a GPS-based approach."
"The design of mobile autonomous robots is challenging due to the limited
on-board resources such as processing power and energy. A promising approach is
to generate intelligent schedules that trade off reduced resource consumption
for a slightly lower but still acceptable level of performance. In this paper,
we provide a framework to aid designers in exploring such resource-performance
trade-offs and finding schedules for mobile robots, guided by questions such as
""what is the minimum resource budget required to achieve a given level of
performance?"" The framework is based on a quantitative multi-objective
verification technique which, for a collection of possibly conflicting
objectives, produces the Pareto front that contains all the optimal trade-offs
that are achievable. The designer then selects a specific Pareto point based on
the resource constraints and desired performance level, and a
correct-by-construction schedule that meets those constraints is automatically
generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on several robotic
scenarios with encouraging results."
"Uncertainty is a major difficulty in endowing robots with autonomy. Robots
often fail due to unexpected events. In robot contact tasks are often design to
empirically look for force thresholds to define state transitions in a Markov
chain or finite state machines. Such design is prone to failure in unstructured
environments, when due to external disturbances or erroneous models, such
thresholds are met, and lead to state transitions that are false-positives. The
focus of this paper is to perform high-level state estimation of robot
behaviors and task output for robot contact tasks. Our approach encodes raw
low-level 3D cartesian trajectories and converts them into a high level (HL)
action grammars. Cartesian trajectories can be segmented and encoded in a way
that their dynamic properties, or ""texture"" are preserved. Once an action
grammar is generated, a classifier is trained to detect current behaviors and
ultimately the task output. The system executed HL state estimation for task
output verification with an accuracy of 86%, and behavior monitoring with an
average accuracy of: 72%. The significance of the work is the transformation of
difficult-to-use raw low-level data to HL data that enables robust behavior and
task monitoring. Monitoring is useful for failure correction or other
deliberation in high-level planning, programming by demonstration, and
human-robot interaction to name a few."
"Robotic failure is all too common in unstructured robot tasks. Despite well
designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. How do robots
measure unexpected events? Many do not. Most robots are driven by the
senseplan- act paradigm, however more recently robots are working with a
sense-plan-act-verify paradigm. In this work we present a principled
methodology to bootstrap robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we
are trying to answer the question, what did the robot do? To this end, we
hypothesize that all noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be
effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is generated by
meaningfully segmenting the data and then encoding it. When the wrench
information represents a sequence of sub-tasks, we can think of the vocabulary
forming sets of words or sentences, such that each subtask is uniquely
represented by a word set. Such sets can be classified using statistical or
machine learning techniques. We use SVMs and Mondrian Forests to classify
contacts tasks both in simulation and in real robots for one and dual arm
scenarios showing the general robustness of the approach. The contribution of
our work is the presentation of a simple but generalizable semantic scheme that
enables a robot to understand its high level state. This verification mechanism
can provide feedback for high-level planners or reasoning systems that use
semantic descriptors as well. The code, data, and other supporting
documentation can be found at:
http://www.juanrojas.net/2017icra_wrench_introspection."
"This paper considers the problem of safe mission planning of dynamic systems
operating under uncertain environments. Much of the prior work on achieving
robust and safe control requires solving second-order cone programs (SOCP).
Unfortunately, existing general purpose SOCP methods are often infeasible for
real-time robotic tasks due to high memory and computational requirements
imposed by existing general optimization methods. The key contribution of this
paper is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm for SOCP that would enable
robust and safe mission planning on-board robots in real-time. Our algorithm
does not have any external dependency, can efficiently utilize warm start
provided in safe planning settings, and in fact leads to significant speed up
over standard optimization packages (like SDPT3) for even standard SOCP
problems. For example, for a standard quadrotor problem, our method leads to
speedup of 1000x over SDPT3 without any deterioration in the solution quality.
  Our method is based on two insights: a) SOCPs can be interpreted as
optimizing a function over a polytope with infinite sides, b) a linear function
can be efficiently optimized over this polytope. We combine the above
observations with a novel utilization of Wolfe's algorithm to obtain an
efficient optimization method that can be easily implemented on small embedded
devices. In addition to the above mentioned algorithm, we also design a
two-level sensing method based on Gaussian Process for complex obstacles with
non-linear boundaries such as a cylinder."
"In grasp detection, the robot estimates the position and orientation of
potential grasp configurations directly from sensor data. This paper explores
the relationship between viewpoint and grasp detection performance.
Specifically, we consider the scenario where the approximate position and
orientation of a desired grasp is known in advance and we want to select a
viewpoint that will enable a grasp detection algorithm to localize it more
precisely and with higher confidence. Our main findings are that the right
viewpoint can dramatically increase the number of detected grasps and the
classification accuracy of the top-n detections. We use this insight to create
a viewpoint selection algorithm and compare it against a random viewpoint
selection strategy and a strategy that views the desired grasp head-on. We find
that the head-on strategy and our proposed viewpoint selection strategy can
improve grasp success rates on a real robot by 8% and 4%, respectively.
Moreover, we find that the combination of the two methods can improve grasp
success rates by as much as 12%."
"Many people with motor disabilities are unable to complete activities of
daily living (ADLs) without assistance. This paper describes a complete robotic
system developed to provide mobile grasping assistance for ADLs. The system is
comprised of a robot arm from a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot mounted to an
assistive mobility device, a control system for that arm, and a user interface
with a variety of access methods for selecting desired objects. The system uses
grasp detection to allow previously unseen objects to be picked up by the
system. The grasp detection algorithms also allow for objects to be grasped in
cluttered environments. We evaluate our system in a number of experiments on a
large variety of objects. Overall, we achieve an object selection success rate
of 88% and a grasp detection success rate of 90% in a non-mobile scenario, and
success rates of 89% and 72% in a mobile scenario."
"Finding the Time-Optimal Parameterization of a Path (TOPP) subject to
second-order constraints (e.g. acceleration, torque, contact stability, etc.)
is an important and well-studied problem in robotics. In comparison, TOPP
subject to third-order constraints (e.g. jerk, torque rate, etc.) has received
far less attention and remains largely open. In this paper, we investigate the
structure of the TOPP problem with third-order constraints. In particular, we
identify two major difficulties: (i) how to smoothly connect optimal profiles,
and (ii) how to address singularities, which stop profile integration
prematurely. We propose a new algorithm, TOPP3, which addresses these two
difficulties and thereby constitutes an important milestone towards an
efficient computational solution to TOPP with third-order constraints."
"This paper presents a tool for addressing a key component in many algorithms
for planning robot trajectories under uncertainty: evaluation of the safety of
a robot whose actions are governed by a closed-loop feedback policy near a
nominal planned trajectory. We describe an adaptive importance sampling Monte
Carlo framework that enables the evaluation of a given control policy for
satisfaction of a probabilistic collision avoidance constraint which also
provides an associated certificate of accuracy (in the form of a confidence
interval). In particular this adaptive technique is well-suited to addressing
the complexities of rigid-body collision checking applied to non-linear robot
dynamics. As a Monte Carlo method it is amenable to parallelization for
computational tractability, and is generally applicable to a wide gamut of
simulatable systems, including alternative noise models. Numerical experiments
demonstrating the effectiveness of the adaptive importance sampling procedure
are presented and discussed."
"We have been developing a paradigm, which we refer to as
Learning-from-observation, for a robot to automatically acquire what-to-do
through observation of human performance. Since a simple mimicking method to
repeat exact joint angles does not work due to the kinematic and dynamic
difference between a human and a robot, the method introduces an intermediate
symbolic representation, task models, to conceptually represent what-to-do
through observation. Then, these task models are mapped appropriate robot
motions depending on each robot hardware. This paper presents task models,
designed based on the Labanotation, for upper body movements of humanoid
robots. Given a human motion sequence, we first analyze the motions of the
upper body, and extract certain fixed poses at certain key frames. These key
poses are translated into states represented by Labanotation symbols. Then,
task models, identified from the state transitions, are mapped to robot
movements on a particular robot hardware. Since the task models based on
Labanotation are independent from different robot hardware, we can share the
same observation module; we only need task mapping modules depending on
different robot hardware. The system was implemented and demonstrated that
three different robots can automatically mimic human upper body motions with
satisfactory level of resemblance."
"We study simultaneous localization and mapping with a device that uses
reflections to measure its distance from walls. Such a device can be realized
acoustically with a synchronized collocated source and receiver; it behaves
like a bat with no capacity for directional hearing or vocalizing. In this
paper we generalize our previous work in 2D, and show that the 3D case is not
just a simple extension, but rather a fundamentally different inverse problem.
While generically the 2D problem has a unique solution, in 3D uniqueness is
always absent in rooms with fewer than nine walls. In addition to the complete
characterization of ambiguities which arise due to this non-uniqueness, we
propose a robust solution for inexact measurements similar to analogous results
for Euclidean Distance Matrices. Our theoretical results have important
consequences for the design of collocated range-only SLAM systems, and we
support them with an array of computer experiments."
"The time derivative of a rotation matrix equals the product of a
skew-symmetric matrix and the rotation matrix itself. This article gives a
brief tutorial on the well-known result."
"The generalized label correcting method is an efficient search-based approach
to trajectory optimization. It relies on a finite set of control primitives
that are concatenated into candidate control signals. This paper investigates
the principled selection of this set of control primitives. Emphasis is placed
on a particularly challenging input space geometry, the $n$-dimensional sphere.
We propose using controls which minimize a generalized energy function and
discuss the optimization technique used to obtain these control primitives. A
numerical experiment is presented showing a factor of two improvement in
running time when using the optimized control primitives over a random sampling
strategy."
"How does one obtain an admissible heuristic for a kinodynamic motion planning
problem? This paper develops the analytical tools and techniques to answer this
question. A sufficient condition for the admissibility of a heuristic is
presented which can be checked directly from the problem data. This condition
is also used to formulate a concave program to optimize an admissible
heuristic. This optimization is then approximated and solved in polynomial time
using sum-of-squares programming techniques. A number of examples are provided
to demonstrate these concepts."
"Bio-inspired methods can provide efficient solutions to perform autonomous
landing for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Flying insects such as honeybees perform
vertical landings by keeping flow divergence constant. This leads to an
exponential decay of both height and vertical velocity, and allows for smooth
and safe landings. However, the presence of noise and delay in obtaining flow
divergence estimates will cause instability of the landing when the control
gains are not adapted to the height. In this paper, we propose a strategy that
deals with this fundamental problem of optical flow control. The key to the
strategy lies in the use of a recent theory that allows the MAV to see distance
by means of its control instability. At the start of a landing, the MAV detects
the height by means of an oscillating movement and sets the control gains
accordingly. Then, during descent, the gains are reduced exponentially, with
mechanisms in place to reduce or increase the gains if the actual trajectory
deviates too much from an ideal constant divergence landing. Real-world
experiments demonstrate stable landings of the MAV in both indoor and windy
outdoor environments."
"We propose a novel unifying scheme for parallel implementation of articulated
robot dynamics algorithms. It is based on a unified Lie group notation for
deriving the equations of motion of articulated robots, where various
well-known forward algorithms differ only by their joint inertia matrix
inversion strategies. This new scheme leads to a unified abstraction of
state-of-the-art forward dynamics algorithms into combinations of block
bi-diagonal and/or block tri-diagonal systems, which may be efficiently solved
by parallel all-prefix-sum operations (scan) and parallel odd-even elimination
(OEE) respectively. We implement the proposed scheme on a Nvidia CUDA GPU
platform for the comparative study of three algorithms, namely the hybrid
articulated-body inertia algorithm (ABIA), the parallel joint space inertia
inversion algorithm (JSIIA) and the constrained force algorithm (CFA), and the
performances are analyzed."
"The potential of large tactile arrays to improve robot perception for safe
operation in human-dominated environments and of high-resolution tactile arrays
to enable human-level dexterous manipulation is well accepted. However, the
increase in the number of tactile sensing elements introduces challenges
including wiring complexity, power consumption, and data processing. To help
address these challenges, we previously developed a tactile sensing technique
based compressed sensing that reduces hardware complexity and data
transmission, while allowing accurate reconstruction of the full-resolution
signal. In this paper, we apply tactile compressed sensing to the problem of
object classification. Specifically, we perform object classification on the
compressed tactile data. We evaluate our method using BubbleTouch, our tactile
array simulator. Our results show our approach achieves high classification
accuracy, even with compression factors up to 64."
"Recent advances have been made in learning of grasps for fully actuated
hands. A typical approach learns the target locations of finger links on the
object. When a new object must be grasped, new finger locations are generated,
and a collision free reach-to-grasp trajectory is planned. This assumes a
collision free trajectory to the final grasp. This is not possible with
underactuated hands, which cannot be guaranteed to avoid contact, and in fact
exploit contacts with the object during grasping, so as to reach an equilibrium
state in which the object is held securely. Unfortunately, these contact
interactions are i) not directly controllable, and ii) hard to monitor during a
real grasp. We overcome these problems so as to permit learning of
transferrable grasps for underactuated hands. We make two main technical
innovations. First, we model contact interactions during the grasp implicitly.
We do this by modelling motor commands that lead reliably to the equilibrium
state, rather than modelling contact changes themselves. This alters our
reach-to-grasp model. Second, we extend our contact model learning algorithm to
work with multiple training examples for each grasp type. This requires the
ability to learn which parts of the hand reliably interact with the object
during a particular grasp. Our approach learns from a rigid body simulation.
This enables us to learn how to approach the object and close the underactuated
hand from a variety of poses. From nine training grasps on three objects the
method transferred grasps to previously unseen, novel objects, that differ
significantly from the training objects, with an 80% success rate."
"Loop-closure detection on 3D data is a challenging task that has been
commonly approached by adapting image-based solutions. Methods based on local
features suffer from ambiguity and from robustness to environment changes while
methods based on global features are viewpoint dependent. We propose SegMatch,
a reliable loop-closure detection algorithm based on the matching of 3D
segments. Segments provide a good compromise between local and global
descriptions, incorporating their strengths while reducing their individual
drawbacks.
  SegMatch does not rely on assumptions of ""perfect segmentation"", or on the
existence of ""objects"" in the environment, which allows for reliable execution
on large scale, unstructured environments. We quantitatively demonstrate that
SegMatch can achieve accurate localization at a frequency of 1Hz on the largest
sequence of the KITTI odometry dataset. We furthermore show how this algorithm
can reliably detect and close loops in real-time, during online operation. In
addition, the source code for the SegMatch algorithm will be made available
after publication."
"For intelligent robots to interact in deeply meaningful ways with their
environment, they must understand both the geometric and semantic properties of
the scene surrounding them. The majority of research to date has addressed
these mapping challenges separately, focusing on either geometric or semantic
mapping. In this paper we address the problem of building environmental maps
that include both semantically meaningful, object-level entities and point- or
mesh-based geometrical representations. We simultaneously build geometric point
cloud models of previously unseen instances of known object classes and create
a map that contains these object models as central entities. Our system
leverages sparse, feature-based RGB-D SLAM, image-based deep-learning object
detection and 3D unsupervised segmentation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach through quantitative evaluation in an automated inventory management
task using a new real-world dataset recorded over a building office floor."
"Learning from demonstration for motion planning is an ongoing research topic.
In this paper we present a model that is able to learn the complex mapping from
raw 2D-laser range findings and a target position to the required steering
commands for the robot. To our best knowledge, this work presents the first
approach that learns a target-oriented end-to-end navigation model for a
robotic platform. Furthermore, the supervised model training is based on expert
demonstrations generated in simulation with an existing motion planner. We
demonstrate that the learned navigation model is directly transferable to
previously unseen virtual and, more interestingly, real-world environments. It
can safely navigate the robot through obstacle-cluttered environments to reach
the desired targets. We present an extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of the neural network-based motion planner, and compare it to a
grid-based global approach, both in simulation and in real-world experiments."
"In this paper, we introduce an informative path planning (IPP) framework for
active classification using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our algorithm uses
a combination of global viewpoint selection and evolutionary optimization to
refine the planned trajectory in continuous 3D space while satisfying dynamic
constraints. Our approach is evaluated on the application of weed detection for
precision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland using an
occupancy grid and generate adaptive plans according to information-theoretic
objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We validate our
approach in simulation by comparing against existing methods, and study the
effects of different planning strategies. Our results show that the proposed
algorithm builds maps with over 50% lower entropy compared to traditional
""lawnmower"" coverage in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the planning
scheme on a multirotor platform with different artificial farmland set-ups."
"This work provides an architecture to enable robotic grasp planning via shape
completion. Shape completion is accomplished through the use of a 3D
convolutional neural network (CNN). The network is trained on our own new open
source dataset of over 440,000 3D exemplars captured from varying viewpoints.
At runtime, a 2.5D pointcloud captured from a single point of view is fed into
the CNN, which fills in the occluded regions of the scene, allowing grasps to
be planned and executed on the completed object. Runtime shape completion is
very rapid because most of the computational costs of shape completion are
borne during offline training. We explore how the quality of completions vary
based on several factors. These include whether or not the object being
completed existed in the training data and how many object models were used to
train the network. We also look at the ability of the network to generalize to
novel objects allowing the system to complete previously unseen objects at
runtime. Finally, experimentation is done both in simulation and on actual
robotic hardware to explore the relationship between completion quality and the
utility of the completed mesh model for grasping."
"Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) will unlock their true potential once they can
operate in groups. To this end, it is essential for them to estimate on-board
the relative location of their neighbors. The challenge lies in limiting the
mass and processing burden needed to enable this. We developed a relative
localization method that only requires the MAVs to communicate via their
wireless transceiver. Communication allows the exchange of on-board states
(velocity, height, and orientation), while the signal-strength provides range
data. These quantities are fused to provide a full relative location estimate.
We used our method to tackle the problem of collision avoidance in tight areas.
The system was tested with a team of AR.Drones flying in a 4mx4m area and with
miniature drones of ~50g in a 2mx2m area. The MAVs were able to track their
relative positions and fly several minutes without collisions. Our
implementation used Bluetooth to communicate between the drones. This featured
significant noise and disturbances in signal-strength, which worsened as more
drones were added. Simulation analysis suggests that results can improve with a
more suitable transceiver module."
"The direct kinematics analysis is the foundation of implementation of real
world application of parallel manipulators. For most parallel manipulators the
direct kinematics is challenging. In this paper, for the first time a fast and
efficient Homotopy Continuation Method, called the Ostrowski Homotopy
continuation method has been implemented to solve the direct and inverse
kinematics problem of the parallel manipulators. This method has advantage over
conventional numerical iteration methods, which is not rely on the initial
values and is more efficient than other continuation method and it can find all
solutions of equations without divergence just by changing auxiliary Homotopy
function. Numerical example and simulation was done to solve the direct
kinematic problem of the 3-UPU parallel manipulator that leads to 16 real
solutions. Results obviously reveal the fastness and effectiveness of this
method than the conventional Homotopy continuation methods such as Newton
Homotopy. The results shows that the Ostrowski-Homotopy reduces computation
time up to 80-97 % with more accuracy in solutions in comparison with the
Newton Homotopy."
"This research investigates decentralized control of mobile robots
specifically for coverage problems. There are different approaches associated
with decentralized control strategy for coverage control problems. We perform a
comparative review of these approaches and use the approach based on simple
local coordination rules. We investigate this extensively used nearest
neighbour rule based approach for developing coverage control algorithms. In
this approach, a mobile robot gives an equal importance to every neighbour
robot coming under its communication range. We develop our control approach by
making some of the mobile robots playing a more influential role than other
members in the team. The approach based on this control strategy becomes
efficient in terms of achieving a consensus on control inputs, say heading
angle, velocity, etc. The decentralized control of mobile robots can also
exhibit a cyclic behaviour under some physical constraints like a quantized
orientation of mobile robot. We further investigate the cyclic behaviour
appearing due to the quantized control of mobile robots under some conditions.
Our nearest neighbour rule based approach offers a biased strategy in case of
cyclic behaviour appearing in the team of mobile robots. We consider a
clustering technique inside the team of mobile robots. Our decentralized
control strategy calculates the similarity measure among the neighbours of a
mobile robot. The team of mobile robots with the similarity measure based
approach becomes efficient in achieving a fast consensus like on heading angle
or velocity. We perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of our developed
approach. We also develop a condition based on relaxed criteria for achieving
consensus on velocity or heading angle of the mobile robots. Our validation
approach is based on mathematical arguments and extensive computer simulations."
"The paper presents a proof of concept to calibrate iCub's skin using vacuum
bags. The method's main idea consists in inserting the skin in a vacuum bag,
and then decreasing the pressure in the bag to create a uniform pressure
distribution on the skin surface. Acquisition and data processing of the bag
pressure and sensors' measured capacitance allow us to characterize the
relationship between the pressure and the measured capacitance of each sensor.
After calibration, integration of the pressure distribution over the skin
geometry provides us with the net normal force applied to the skin. Experiments
are conducted using the forearm skin of the iCub humanoid robot, and validation
results indicate acceptable average errors in force prediction."
"In this paper, a method for stabilizing biped robots stepping by a
combination of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) tracking and step adjustment
is proposed. In this method, the DCM trajectory is generated, consistent with
the predefined footprints. Furthermore, a swing foot trajectory modification
strategy is proposed to adapt the landing point, using DCM measurement. In
order to apply the generated trajectories to the full robot, a Hierarchical
Inverse Dynamics (HID) is employed. The HID enables us to use different
combinations of the DCM tracking and step adjustment for stabilizing different
biped robots. Simulation experiments on two scenarios for two different
simulated robots, one with active ankles and the other with passive ankles, are
carried out. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for robots with both active and passive ankles."
"Traversing environments with arbitrary obstacles poses significant challenges
for bipedal robots. In some cases, whole body motions may be necessary to
maneuver around an obstacle, but most existing footstep planners can only
select from a discrete set of predetermined footstep actions; they are unable
to utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the
robot platform. Existing motion planners that can utilize whole body motion
tend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a
planning method, called the ""Randomized Possibility Graph"", which uses
high-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the
""possibility"" of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be
utilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in
a variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context,
""semi-unstructured"" means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are
arbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped
over or maneuvered around using whole body motions."
"Locomotion for legged robots poses considerable challenges when confronted by
obstacles and adverse environments. Footstep planners are typically only
designed for one mode of locomotion, but traversing unfavorable environments
may require several forms of locomotion to be sequenced together, such as
walking, crawling, and jumping. Multi-modal motion planners can be used to
address some of these problems, but existing implementations tend to be
time-consuming and are limited to quasi-static actions. This paper presents a
motion planning method to traverse complex environments using multiple
categories of continuous actions. To this end, this paper formulates and
exploits the Possibility Graph---which uses high-level approximations of
constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the ""possibility"" of actions---to
utilize lower-level single-action motion planners more effectively. We show
that the Possibility Graph can quickly find routes through several different
challenging environments which require various combinations of actions in order
to traverse."
"This paper addresses the motion planning problem for a team of aerial agents
under high level goals. We propose a hybrid control strategy that guarantees
the accomplishment of each agent's local goal specification, which is given as
a temporal logic formula, while guaranteeing inter-agent collision avoidance.
In particular, by defining 3-D spheres that bound the agents' volume, we extend
previous work on decentralized navigation functions and propose control laws
that navigate the agents among predefined regions of interest of the workspace
while avoiding collision with each other. This allows us to abstract the motion
of the agents as finite transition systems and, by employing standard formal
verification techniques, to derive a high-level control algorithm that
satisfies the agents' specifications. Simulation and experimental results with
quadrotors verify the validity of the proposed method."
"This paper addresses the problem of cooperative manipulation of a single
object by N robotic agents under local goal specifications given as Metric
Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) formulas. In particular, we propose a
distributed model-free control protocol for the trajectory tracking of the
cooperatively manipulated object without necessitating feedback of the contact
forces/torques or inter-agent communication. This allows us to abstract the
motion of the coupled object-agents system as a finite transition system and,
by employing standard automata-based methodologies, we derive a hybrid control
algorithm for the satisfaction of a given MITL formula. In addition, we use
load sharing coefficients to represent potential differences in power
capabilities among the agents. Finally, simulation studies verify the validity
of the proposed scheme."
"In this paper, we propose a compact twisted string actuation system that
achieves a high contraction percentage (81%) on two phases: multi string twist
and overtwist. This type of system can be used in many robotic applications,
such as robotic hands and exoskeletons. The overtwist phase enables the
development of more compact actuators based on the twisted string systems.
Furthermore, by analyzing the previously developed mathematical models, we
found out that a constant radius model should be applied for the overtwisting
phase. Moreover, we propose an improvement of an existing model for prediction
of the radius of the multi string system after they twist around each other.
This model helps to better estimate the bundle diameter which results in a more
precise mathematical model for multi string systems. The model was validated by
performing experiments with 2, 4, 6 and 8 string systems. Finally, we performed
extensive life cycle tests with different loads and contractions to find out
the expected life of the system."
"This paper proposes a task-space control protocol for the collaborative
manipulation of a single object by N robotic agents. The proposed methodology
is decentralized in the sense that each agent utilizes information associated
with its own and the object's dynamic/kinematic parameters and no on-line
communication takes place. Moreover, no feedback of the contact forces/torques
is required, therefore employment of corresponding sensors is avoided. An
adaptive version of the control scheme is also introduced, where the agents'
and object's dynamic parameters are considered unknown. We also use unit
quaternions to represent the object's orientation. In addition, load sharing
coefficients between the agents are employed and internal force regulation is
guaranteed. Finally, experimental studies with two robotic arms verify the
validity and effectiveness of the proposed control protocol."
"Informative path planning (IPP) is used to design paths for robotic sensor
platforms to extract the best/maximum possible information about a quantity of
interest while operating under a set of constraints, such as the dynamic
feasibility of vehicles. The key challenges of IPP are the strong coupling in
multiple layers of decisions: the selection of locations to visit, the
allocation of sensor platforms to those locations; and the processing of the
gathered information along the paths. This paper presents a systematic
procedure for IPP and environmental mapping using multiple UAV sensor
platforms. It (a) selects the best locations to observe, (b) calculates the
cost and finds the best paths for each UAV, and (c) estimates the measurement
value within a given region using the Gaussian process (GP) regression
framework. An illustrative example of RF intensity field mapping is presented
to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach."
"This work presents an on-going investigation of the control of a pneumatic
soft-robot actuator addressing accurate patient positioning systems in maskless
head and neck cancer radiotherapy. We employ two RGB-D sensors in a sensor
fusion scheme to better estimate a patient's head pitch motion. A system
identification prediction error model is used to obtain a linear time invariant
state space model. We then use the model to design a linear quadratic Gaussian
feedback controller to manipulate the patient head position based on sensed
head pitch motion. Experiments demonstrate the success of our approach."
"Step adjustment for humanoid robots has been shown to improve robustness in
gaits. However, step duration adaptation is often neglected in control
strategies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both step
location and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach,
step location and step timing are decided, based on feedback from the current
state of the robot. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the
first stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step or a
previewed number of steps are specified. In this stage which is done at the
start of each step, the main goal is to specify the best step length and step
duration for a desired walking speed. The second stage deals with finding the
best landing point and landing time of the swing foot at each control cycle. In
this stage, stability of the gaits is preserved by specifying a desired offset
between the swing foot landing point and the Divergent Component of Motion
(DCM) at the end of current step. After specifying the landing point of the
swing foot at a desired time, the swing foot trajectory is regenerated at each
control cycle to realize desired landing properties. Simulation on different
scenarios shows the robustness of the generated gaits from our proposed
approach compared to the case where no timing adjustment is employed."
"In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of piecewise affine feedback
controllers to address the problem of safe and robust controller design in
robotics based on high-level controls specifications. The methodology is based
on formulating the problem as a collection of reach control problems on a
polytopic state space. Reach control has so far only been developed in theory
and has not been tested experimentally on a real system before. Using a
quadrocopter as our experimental platform, we show that these theoretical tools
can achieve fast, albeit safe and robust maneuvers. In contrast to most
traditional control techniques, the reach control approach does not require a
predefined open-loop reference trajectory or spacial path. Experimental results
on a quadrocopter show the effectiveness and robustness of this control
approach. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, the reach controller is
implemented in one translational direction while the other degrees of freedom
are stabilized by separate controllers."
"Small variance asymptotics is emerging as a useful technique for inference in
large scale Bayesian non-parametric mixture models. This paper analyses the
online learning of robot manipulation tasks with Bayesian non-parametric
mixture models under small variance asymptotics. The analysis yields a scalable
online sequence clustering (SOSC) algorithm that is non-parametric in the
number of clusters and the subspace dimension of each cluster. SOSC groups the
new datapoint in its low dimensional subspace by online inference in a
non-parametric mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA)
based on Dirichlet process, and captures the state transition and state
duration information online in a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) based on
hierarchical Dirichlet process. A task-parameterized formulation of our
approach autonomously adapts the model to changing environmental situations
during manipulation. We apply the algorithm in a teleoperation setting to
recognize the intention of the operator and remotely adjust the movement of the
robot using the learned model. The generative model is used to synthesize both
time-independent and time-dependent behaviours by relying on the principles of
shared and autonomous control. Experiments with the Baxter robot yield
parsimonious clusters that adapt online with new demonstrations and assist the
operator in performing remote manipulation tasks."

"Human-robot handovers are characterized by high uncertainty and poor
structure of the problem that make them difficult tasks. While machine learning
methods have shown promising results, their application to problems with large
state dimensionality, such as in the case of humanoid robots, is still limited.
Additionally, by using these methods and during the interaction with the human
operator, no guarantees can be obtained on the correct interpretation of
spatial constraints (e.g., from social rules). In this paper, we present Policy
Improvement with Spatio-Temporal Affordance Maps -- $\pi$-STAM, a novel
iterative algorithm to learn spatial affordances and generate robot behaviors.
Our goal consists in generating a policy that adapts to the unknown action
semantics by using affordances. In this way, while learning to perform a
human-robot handover task, we can (1) efficiently generate good policies with
few training episodes, and (2) easily encode action semantics and, if
available, enforce prior knowledge in it. We experimentally validate our
approach both in simulation and on a real NAO robot whose task consists in
taking an object from the hands of a human. The obtained results show that our
algorithm obtains a good policy while reducing the computational load and time
duration of the learning process."
"We propose a new probabilistic framework that allows mobile robots to
autonomously learn deep generative models of their environments that span
multiple levels of abstraction. Unlike traditional approaches that integrate
engineered models for low-level features, geometry, and semantic information,
our approach leverages recent advances in Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and deep
learning to learn a generative model of a robot's spatial environment, from
low-level input to semantic interpretations. Our model is capable of solving a
wide range of tasks from semantic classification of places, uncertainty
estimation and novelty detection to generation of place appearances based on
semantic information and prediction of missing data in partial observations.
Experiments on laser range data from a mobile robot show that the proposed
single universal model obtains accuracy or efficiency superior to models
fine-tuned to specific sub-problems, such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or SVMs."
"This letter summarizes some known properties and also presents several new
properties of the Numerical Integration (NI) method for time-optimal trajectory
planning along a specified path. The contribution is that rigorous mathematical
proofs of these properties are presented, most of which cannot be found in
existing literatures. We first give some properties regarding switch points and
accelerating/decelerating curves of the NI method. Then, for the fact that when
kinematic constraints are considered, the original version of NI which only
considers torque constraints may result in failure of trajectory planning, we
give the concrete failure conditions with rigorous mathematical proof.
Accordingly, a failure detection algorithm is given in a run-and-test manner.
Some simulation results on a unicycle vehicle are provided to verify those
presented properties. Note that though those known properties are not
discovered first, their mathematical proofs are given first in this letter. The
detailed proofs make the theory of NI more complete and help interested readers
to gain a thorough understanding of the method."
"This paper proposes and validates an in situ calibration method to calibrate
six axis force torque (F/T) sensors once they are mounted on the system. This
procedure takes advantage of the knowledge of the model of the robot to
generate the expected wrenches of the sensors during some arbitrary motions. It
then uses this information to train and validate new calibration matrices,
taking into account the calibration matrix obtained with a classical Workbench
calibration. The proposed calibration algorithm is validated on the F/T sensors
mounted on the iCub humanoid robot legs."
"Visual attention is the cognitive process that allows humans to parse a large
amount of sensory data by selecting relevant information and filtering out
irrelevant stimuli. This papers develops a computational framework for visual
attention in robots. We consider a Visual Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem in
which a robot needs to estimate its state using an on-board camera and an
inertial sensor. The robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to time
and energy constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under
limited resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the
performance of visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key features.
First, it is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by
a metric quantifying the task performance. Second, it exploits the notion of
anticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot
dynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a time horizon.
Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a greedy
algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it
provides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that
the greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection.
Simulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach leads
to dramatic improvements in the VIN performance. In the easy scenarios, our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of localization errors. In
the most challenging scenarios, it enables accurate visual-inertial navigation
while the state of the art fails to track robot's motion during aggressive
maneuvers."
"With the advancement of robotics, machine learning, and machine perception,
increasingly more robots will enter human environments to assist with daily
tasks. However, dynamically-changing human environments requires reactive
motion plans. Reactivity can be accomplished through replanning, e.g.
model-predictive control, or through a reactive feedback policy that modifies
on-going behavior in response to sensory events. In this paper, we investigate
how to use machine learning to add reactivity to a previously learned nominal
skilled behavior. We approach this by learning a reactive modification term for
movement plans represented by nonlinear differential equations. In particular,
we use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to represent a skill and a neural
network to learn a reactive policy from human demonstrations. We use the well
explored domain of obstacle avoidance for robot manipulation as a test bed. Our
approach demonstrates how a neural network can be combined with physical
insights to ensure robust behavior across different obstacle settings and
movement durations. Evaluations on an anthropomorphic robotic system
demonstrate the effectiveness of our work."
"With advancing technologies, robotic manipulators and visual environment
sensors are becoming cheaper and more widespread. However, robot control can be
still a limiting factor for better adaptation of these technologies. Robotic
manipulators are performing very well in structured workspaces, but do not
adapt well to unexpected changes, like people entering the workspace. We
present a method combining 3D Camera based workspace mapping, and a predictive
and reflexive robot manipulator trajectory estimation to allow more efficient
and safer operation in dynamic workspaces. In experiments on a real UR5 robot
our method has proven to provide shorter and smoother trajectories compared to
a reactive trajectory planner in the same conditions. Furthermore, the robot
has successfully avoided any contact by initialising the reflexive movement
even when an obstacle got unexpectedly close to the robot. The main goal of our
work is to make the operation more flexible in unstructured dynamic workspaces
and not just avoid obstacles, but also adapt when performing collaborative
tasks with humans in the near future."
"We present new algorithms to perform fast probabilistic collision queries
between convex as well as non-convex objects. Our approach is applicable to
general shapes, where one or more objects are represented using Gaussian
probability distributions. We present a fast new algorithm for a pair of convex
objects, and extend the approach to non-convex models using hierarchical
representations. We highlight the performance of our algorithms with various
convex and non-convex shapes on complex synthetic benchmarks and trajectory
planning benchmarks for a 7-DOF Fetch robot arm."
"This chapter is dedicated to the so-called cuspidal robots, i.e. those robots
that can move from one inverse geometric solution to another without meeting a
singular confuguration. This feature was discovered quite recently and has then
been fascinating a lot of researchers. After a brief history of cuspidal
robots, the chapter provides the main features of cuspidal robots: explanation
of the non-singular change of posture, uniqueness domains, regions of feasible
paths, identification and classification of cuspidal robots. The chapter
focuses on 3-R orthogonal serial robots. The case of 6-dof robots and parallel
robots is discussed in the end of this chapter."
"The ability to open a door is essential for robots to perform home-serving
and rescuing tasks. A substantial problem is to obtain the necessary parameters
such as the width of the door and the length of the handle. Many researchers
utilize computer vision techniques to extract the parameters automatically
which lead to fine but not very stable results because of the complexity of the
environment. We propose a method that utilizes an RGBD sensor and a GUI for
users to 'point' at the target region with a mouse to acquire 3D information.
Algorithms that can extract important parameters from the selected points are
designed. To avoid large internal force induced by the misalignment of the
robot orientation and the normal of the door plane, we design a module that can
compute the normal of the plane by pointing at three non-collinear points and
then drive the robot to the desired orientation. We carried out experiments on
real robot. The result shows that the designed GUI and algorithms can help find
the necessary parameters stably and get the robot prepared for further
operations."
"We propose a probabilistic filtering method which fuses joint measurements
with depth images to yield a precise, real-time estimate of the end-effector
pose in the camera frame. This avoids the need for frame transformations when
using it in combination with visual object tracking methods.
  Precision is achieved by modeling and correcting biases in the joint
measurements as well as inaccuracies in the robot model, such as poor extrinsic
camera calibration. We make our method computationally efficient through a
principled combination of Kalman filtering of the joint measurements and
asynchronous depth-image updates based on the Coordinate Particle Filter.
  We quantitatively evaluate our approach on a dataset recorded from a real
robotic platform, annotated with ground truth from a motion capture system. We
show that our approach is robust and accurate even under challenging conditions
such as fast motion, significant and long-term occlusions, and time-varying
biases. We release the dataset along with open-source code of our approach to
allow for quantitative comparison with alternative approaches."
"We present a novel approach and database which combines the inexpensive
generation of 3D object models via monocular or RGB-D camera images with 3D
printing and a state of the art object tracking algorithm. Unlike recent
efforts towards the creation of 3D object databases for robotics, our approach
does not require expensive and controlled 3D scanning setups and enables anyone
with a camera to scan, print and track complex objects for manipulation
research. The proposed approach results in highly detailed mesh models whose 3D
printed replicas are at times difficult to distinguish from the original. A key
motivation for utilizing 3D printed objects is the ability to precisely control
and vary object properties such as the mass distribution and size in the 3D
printing process to obtain reproducible conditions for robotic manipulation
research. We present CapriDB - an extensible database resulting from this
approach containing initially 40 textured and 3D printable mesh models together
with tracking features to facilitate the adoption of the proposed approach."
"Achieving safe control under uncertainty is a key problem that needs to be
tackled for enabling real-world autonomous robots and cyber-physical systems.
This paper introduces Probabilistic Safety Programs (PSP) that embed both the
uncertainty in the environment as well as invariants that determine safety
parameters. The goal of these PSPs is to evaluate future actions or
trajectories and determine how likely it is that the system will stay safe
under uncertainty. We propose to perform these evaluations by first compiling
the PSP to a graphical model then using a fast variational inference algorithm.
We highlight the efficacy of the framework on the task of safe control of
quadrotors and autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments."

"We consider the configuration formation problem in modular robotic systems
where a set of singleton modules that are spatially distributed in an
environment are required to assume appropriate positions so that they can
configure into a new, user-specified target configuration, while simultaneously
maximizing the amount of information collected while navigating from their
initial to final positions. Each module has a limited energy budget to expend
while moving from its initial to goal location. To solve this problem, we
propose a budget-limited, heuristic search-based algorithm that finds a path
that maximizes the entropy of the expected information along the path. We have
analytically proved that our proposed approach converges within finite time.
Experimental results show that our planning approach has lower run-time than an
auction-based allocation algorithm for selecting modules' spots."
"This paper presents a robust and accurate positioning system that adapts its
behavior to the surrounding environment like the visual brain, mimicking its
capability of filtering out clutter and focusing attention on activity and
relevant information. Especially in indoor environments, which are
characterized by harsh multipath propagation, it is still elusive to achieve
the needed level of accuracy robustly under the constraint of reasonable
infrastructural needs. In such environments it is essential to separate
relevant from irrelevant information and attain an appropriate uncertainty
model for measurements that are used for positioning."
"This paper introduces novel air actuated spherical robot called ""RollRoller"".
The RollRoller robot consists of two essential parts: tubes covered with a
shell as a frame and mechanical controlling parts to correspond movements. The
RollRoller is proposed to be high potential alternative for exploration and
rescue missions robots because robot utilizing its locomotion via all possible
deriving methods (gravity, torque and angular momentum forces). In beginning ,
characteristic and role of each of component and features were explained. Next,
to determine the uniqueness of this robot, the known and other extra possible
motions are shown by proposing their own algorithmic movements. To illustrate
main motion of this robot was inherent to mathematical models, the forward
direction dynamical behavior on flat surface was derived. Additionally, Matlab
Simulink was used to plot the results to validate the behavior for both
fractional and non-fractional terrains. Lastly, after designing the model of
robot in Solidworks Program, Adams/View visualization software ( the robot
simulated form ) was utilized to proof the Matlab Simulink results and to show
the more detailed and complete form of locomotion including the forward
direction and circular locomotion in proposed robot."
"This paper introduces a simulation study of fluid actuated multi-driven
closed system as spherical mobile robot called ""RollRoller"". Robot's mechanism
design consists of two essential parts: tubes to lead a core and mechanical
controlling parts to correspond movements. Our robot gets its motivation force
by displacing the spherical movable mass known as core in curvy manners inside
certain pipes. This simulation investigates by explaining the mechanical and
structural features of the robot for creating hydraulic-base actuation via
force and momentum analysis. Next, we categorize difficult and integrated 2D
motions to omit unstable equilibrium points through derived nonlinear dynamics.
We propose an algorithmic position control in forward direction that creates
hybrid model as solution for motion planning problem in spherical robot. By
deriving nonlinear dynamics of the spherical robot and implementing designed
motion planning, we show how RollRoller can be efficient in high speed
movements in comparison to the other pendulum-driven models. Then, we validate
the results of this position control obtained by nonlinear dynamics via
Adams/view simulation which uses the imported solid model of RollRoller.
Lastly, We have a look to the circular maneuver of this robot by the same
simulator."
"Indoor localization for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) requires
specific localization techniques, since the Global Positioning System (GPS) is
usually not available. We present an efficient onboard computer vision approach
that estimates 2D positions of an MAV in real-time. This global localization
system does not suffer from error accumulation over time and uses a $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$-NN) algorithm to predict positions based on textons---small
characteristic image patches that capture the texture of an environment. A
particle filter aggregates the estimates and resolves positional ambiguities.
To predict the performance of the approach in a given setting, we developed an
evaluation technique that compares environments and identifies critical areas
within them. We conducted flight tests to demonstrate the applicability of our
approach. The algorithm has a localization accuracy of approximately 0.6 m on a
5 m$\times$5 m area at a runtime of 32 ms on board of an MAV. Based on random
sampling, its computational effort is scalable to different platforms, trading
off speed and accuracy."
"Despite the immense technology advancement in the surgeries the criteria of
assessing the surgical skills still remains based on subjective standards. With
the advent of robotic-assisted surgery, new opportunities for objective and
autonomous skill assessment is introduced. Previous works in this area are
mostly based on structured-based method such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which
need enormous pre-processing. In this study, in contrast with them, we develop
a new shaped-based framework for automatically skill assessment and
personalized surgical training with minimum parameter tuning. Our work has
addressed main aspects of skill evaluation; develop gesture recognition model
directly on temporal kinematic signal of robotic-assisted surgery, and build
automated personalized RMIS gesture training framework which . We showed that
our method, with an average accuracy of 82% for suturing, 70% for needle
passing and 85% for knot tying, performs better or equal than the
state-of-the-art methods, while simultaneously needs minimum pre-processing,
parameter tuning and provides surgeons with online feedback for their
performance during training."
"We present methods for offline generation of sparse roadmap spanners that
result in graphs 79% smaller than existing approaches while returning solutions
of equivalent path quality. Our method uses a hybrid approach to sampling that
combines traditional graph discretization with random sampling. We present
techniques that optimize the graph for the L1-norm metric function commonly
used in joint-based robotic planning, purposefully choosing a $t$-stretch
factor based on the geometry of the space, and removing redundant edges that do
not contribute to the graph quality. A high-quality pre-processed sparse
roadmap is then available for re-use across many different planning scenarios
using standard repair and re-plan methods. Pre-computing the roadmap offline
results in more deterministic solutions, reduces the memory requirements by
affording complex rejection criteria, and increases the speed of planning in
high-dimensional spaces allowing more complex problems to be solved such as
multi-modal task planning. Our method is validated through simulated benchmarks
against the SPARS2 algorithm. The source code is freely available online as an
open source extension to OMPL."
"This paper presents a new condition, the fully physical consistency for a set
of inertial parameters to determine if they can be generated by a physical
rigid body. The proposed condition ensure both the positive definiteness and
the triangular inequality of 3D inertia matrices as opposed to existing
techniques in which the triangular inequality constraint is ignored. This paper
presents also a new parametrization that naturally ensures that the inertial
parameters are fully physical consistency. The proposed parametrization is
exploited to reformulate the inertial identification problem as a manifold
optimization problem, that ensures that the identified parameters can always be
generated by a physical body. The proposed optimization problem has been
validated with a set of experiments on the iCub humanoid robot."
"We consider the problem of computing shortest paths in a dense
motion-planning roadmap $\mathcal{G}$. We assume that~$n$, the number of
vertices of $\mathcal{G}$, is very large. Thus, using any path-planning
algorithm that directly searches $\mathcal{G}$, running in $O(V\textrm{log}V +
E) \approx O(n^2)$ time, becomes unacceptably expensive. We are therefore
interested in anytime search to obtain successively shorter feasible paths and
converge to the shortest path in $\mathcal{G}$. Our key insight is to provide
existing path-planning algorithms with a sequence of increasingly dense
subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}$. We study the space of all ($r$-disk) subgraphs of
$\mathcal{G}$. We then formulate and present two densification strategies for
traversing this space which exhibit complementary properties with respect to
problem difficulty. This inspires a third, hybrid strategy which has favourable
properties regardless of problem difficulty. This general approach is then
demonstrated and analyzed using the specific case where a low-dispersion
deterministic sequence is used to generate the samples used for $\mathcal{G}$.
Finally we empirically evaluate the performance of our strategies for random
scenarios in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and on manipulation planning
problems for a 7 DOF robot arm, and validate our analysis."
"On the lines of the huge and varied efforts in the field of automation with
respect to technology development and innovation of vehicles to make them run
autonomously, this paper presents an innovation to a bicycle. A normal daily
use bicycle was modified at low cost such that it runs autonomously, while
maintaining its original form i.e. the manual drive. Hence, a bicycle which
could be normally driven by any human and with a press of switch could run
autonomously according to the needs of the user has been developed."
"We explore optimal motion planning and control for a soccer playing
differential drive robot. Trajectories generated using end-slope cubic Bezier
splines are optimized globally through Bayesian optimization and locally
through Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method. A velocity profile for the
trajectory is generated incorporating kinodynamic constraints of the robots.
Control point optimization resulted in minimum time trajectories while
respecting robot constraints. A novel trajectory tracking algorithm for
differential drive robots is also developed which accounts for transmission
delay. Gauss-Kronrod numerical integration, Newton Rhapson and other numerical
methods have been employed for computational efficiency, keeping in mind the
highly dynamic robot soccer environment. Extensive testing on developed
simulator, as well as on our robot soccer team, has shown marked improvements
in stability and speed over other techniques."
"Personal indoor localization is usually accomplished by fusing information
from various sensors. A common choice is to use the WiFi adapter that provides
information about Access Points that can be found in the vicinity.
Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches to WiFi-based localization often
employ very dense maps of the WiFi signal distribution, and require a
time-consuming process of parameter selection. On the other hand, camera images
are commonly used for visual place recognition, detecting whenever the user
observes a scene similar to the one already recorded in a database. Visual
place recognition algorithms can work with sparse databases of recorded scenes
and are in general simple to parametrize. Therefore, we propose a WiFi-based
global localization method employing the structure of the well-known FAB-MAP
visual place recognition algorithm. Similarly to FAB-MAP our method uses
Chow-Liu trees to estimate a joint probability distribution of re-observation
of a place given a set of features extracted at places visited so far. However,
we are the first who apply this idea to recorded WiFi scans instead of visual
words. The new method is evaluated on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset used in the
EvAAL competition, allowing fair comparison with other solutions."
"We study the problem of devising a closed-loop strategy to control the
position of a robot that is tracking a possibly moving target. The robot is
capable of obtaining noisy measurements of the target's position. The key idea
in active target tracking is to choose control laws that drive the robot to
measurement locations that will reduce the uncertainty in the target's
position. The challenge is that measurement uncertainty often is a function of
the (unknown) relative positions of the target and the robot. Consequently, a
closed-loop control policy is desired which can map the current estimate of the
target's position to an optimal control law for the robot.
  Our main contribution is to devise a closed-loop control policy for target
tracking that plans for a sequence of control actions, instead of acting
greedily. We consider scenarios where the noise in measurement is a function of
the state of the target. We seek to minimize the maximum uncertainty (trace of
the posterior covariance matrix) over all possible measurements. We exploit the
structural properties of a Kalman Filter to build a policy tree that is orders
of magnitude smaller than naive enumeration while still preserving optimality
guarantees. We show how to obtain even more computational savings by relaxing
the optimality guarantees. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through
simulations."
"This paper addresses the problem of improving response times of robots
implemented in the Robotic Operating System (ROS) using formal verification of
computational-time feasibility. In order to verify the real time behaviour of a
robot under uncertain signal processing times, methods of formal verification
of timeliness properties are proposed for data flows in a ROS-based control
system using Probabilistic Timed Programs (PTPs). To calculate the probability
of success under certain time limits, and to demonstrate the strength of our
approach, a case study is implemented for a robotic agent in terms of
operational times verification using the PRISM model checker, which points to
possible enhancements to the operation of the robotic agent."
"In this paper, a novel method for vision-aided navigation based on trifocal
tensor is presented. The main goal of the proposed method is to provide
position estimation in GPS-denied environments for vehicles equipped with a
standard inertial navigation systems(INS) and a single camera only. We treat
the trifocal tensor as the measurement model, being only concerned about the
vehicle state and do not estimate the the position of the tracked landmarks.
The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using simulation and
experimental data."
"Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) that operate in unstructured, unexplored
environments require fast and flexible local planning, which can replan when
new parts of the map are explored. Trajectory optimization methods fulfill
these needs, but require obstacle distance information, which can be given by
Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs).
  We propose a method to incrementally build ESDFs from Truncated Signed
Distance Fields (TSDFs), a common implicit surface representation used in
computer graphics and vision. TSDFs are fast to build and smooth out sensor
noise over many observations, and are designed to produce surface meshes.
Meshes allow human operators to get a better assessment of the robot's
environment, and set high-level mission goals.
  We show that we can build TSDFs faster than Octomaps, and that it is more
accurate to build ESDFs out of TSDFs than occupancy maps. Our complete system,
called voxblox, will be available as open source and runs in real-time on a
single CPU core. We validate our approach on-board an MAV, by using our system
with a trajectory optimization local planner, entirely on-board and in
real-time."
"We present the Model-Predictive Motion Planner (MPMP) of the Intelligent
Autonomous Robotic Automobile (IARA). IARA is a fully autonomous car that uses
a path planner to compute a path from its current position to the desired
destination. Using this path, the current position, a goal in the path and a
map, IARA's MPMP is able to compute smooth trajectories from its current
position to the goal in less than 50 ms. MPMP computes the poses of these
trajectories so that they follow the path closely and, at the same time, are at
a safe distance of eventual obstacles. Our experiments have shown that MPMP is
able to compute trajectories that precisely follow a path produced by a Human
driver (distance of 0.15 m in average) while smoothly driving IARA at speeds of
up to 32.4 km/h (9 m/s)."
"This paper presents an algorithm to deploy a team of {\it free} guards
equipped with omni-directional cameras for tracking a bounded speed intruder
inside a simply-connected polygonal environment. The proposed algorithm
partitions the environment into smaller polygons, and assigns a guard to each
partition so that the intruder is visible to at least one guard at all times.
Based on the concept of {\it dynamic zones} introduced in this paper, we
propose event-triggered strategies for the guards to track the intruder. We
show that the number of guards deployed by the algorithm for tracking is
strictly less than $\lfloor {\frac{n}{3}} \rfloor$ which is sufficient and
sometimes necessary for coverage. We derive an upper bound on the speed of the
mobile guard required for successful tracking which depends on the intruder's
speed, the road map of the mobile guards, and geometry of the environment.
Finally, we extend the aforementioned analysis to orthogonal polygons, and show
that the upper bound on the number of guards deployed for tracking is strictly
less than $\lfloor {\frac{n}{4}} \rfloor$ which is sufficient and sometimes
necessary for the coverage problem."
"Micro-robotics at low Reynolds number has been a growing area of research
over the past decade. We propose and study a generalized 3-link robotic swimmer
inspired by the planar Purcell's swimmer at low Reynolds number. By
incorporating out-of-plane motion of the outer limbs, this mechanism
generalizes the planar Purcell's swimmer, which has been widely studied in the
literature. Such an evolution of the limbs' motion results in the swimmer's
base link to evolve in a 3 dimensional space. This swimmer's configuration
space admits a trivial principal fiber bundle structure, which along with the
slender body theory at the low Reynolds number regime, facilitates obtaining a
kinematic form of the equations. A coordinate-free expression for the local
form of the kinematic connection is then derived, followed by a local
parametrization for simulation purpose. We then present a local controllability
analysis of the swimmer at the low Reynolds number regime using weak
controllability results of the planar Purcell's swimmer."
"This article addresses the problem of Cooperative Coverage Path Planning
(C-CPP) for the inspection of complex infrastructures (offline 3D
reconstruction) by utilizing multiple Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed scheme, based on a priori 3D model of the infrastructure under
inspection, is able to generate multiple paths for UAVs in order to achieve a
complete cooperative coverage in a short time. Initially the infrastructure
under inspection is being sliced by horizontal planes, which has the capability
of recognizing the branches of the structure and these branches will be handled
as breaking points for the path planning of the UAVs to collaboratively execute
the coverage task in less time and more realistically, based on the current
flying times of the UAVs. The multiple data sets collected from the coverage
are merged for the offline sparse and dense 3D reconstruction of the
infrastructure by utilizing SLAM and Structure from Motion approaches, with
either monocular or stereo sensors. The performance of the proposed C-CPP has
been experimentally evaluated in multiple indoor and realistic outdoor
infrastructure inspection experiments."
"Inserting an end of a rope through a loop is a common and important action
that is required for creating most types of knots. To perform this action, we
need to pass the end of the rope through an area that is enclosed by another
segment of rope. As for all knotting actions, the robot must for this exercise
control over a semi-compliant and flexible body whose complex 3d shape is
difficult to perceive and follow. Additionally, the target loop often deforms
during the insertion. We address this problem by defining a virtual magnetic
field through the loop's interior and use the Biot Savart law to guide the
robotic manipulator that holds the end of the rope. This approach directly
defines, for any manipulator position, a motion vector that results in a path
that passes through the loop. The motion vector is directly derived from the
position of the loop and changes as soon as it moves or deforms. In simulation,
we test the insertion action against dynamic loop deformation of different
intensity. We also combine insertion with grasp and release actions,
coordinated by a hybrid control system, to tie knots in simulation and with a
NAO robot."
"For collaborative robots to become useful, end users who are not robotics
experts must be able to instruct them to perform a variety of tasks. With this
goal in mind, we developed a system for end-user creation of robust task plans
with a broad range of capabilities. CoSTAR: the Collaborative System for Task
Automation and Recognition is our winning entry in the 2016 KUKA Innovation
Award competition at the Hannover Messe trade show, which this year focused on
Flexible Manufacturing. CoSTAR is unique in how it creates natural abstractions
that use perception to represent the world in a way users can both understand
and utilize to author capable and robust task plans. Our Behavior Tree-based
task editor integrates high-level information from known object segmentation
and pose estimation with spatial reasoning and robot actions to create robust
task plans. We describe the cross-platform design and implementation of this
system on multiple industrial robots and evaluate its suitability for a wide
variety of use cases."
"Robotic grasping traditionally relies on object features or shape information
for learning new or applying already learned grasps. We argue however that such
a strong reliance on object geometric information renders grasping and grasp
learning a difficult task in the event of cluttered environments with high
uncertainty where reasonable object models are not available. This being so, in
this paper we thus investigate the application of model-free stochastic
optimization for grasp learning. For this, our proposed learning method
requires just a handful of user-demonstrated grasps and an initial prior by a
rough sketch of an object's grasp affordance density, yet no object geometric
knowledge except for its pose. Our experiments show promising applicability of
our proposed learning method."
"We guess humans start acquiring grasping skills as early as at the infant
stage by virtue of two key processes. First, infants attempt to learn grasps
for known objects by imitating humans. Secondly, knowledge acquired during this
process is reused in learning to grasp novel objects. We argue that these
processes of active and transfer learning boil down to a random search of
grasps on an object, suitably biased by prior experience. In this paper we
introduce active learning of grasps for known objects as well as transfer
learning of grasps for novel objects grounded on kernel adaptive, mode-hopping
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our experiments show promising applicability of our
proposed learning methods."
"Human ability of both versatile grasping of given objects and grasping of
novel (as of yet unseen) objects is truly remarkable. This probably arises from
the experience infants gather by actively playing around with diverse objects.
Moreover, knowledge acquired during this process is reused during learning of
how to grasp novel objects. We conjecture that this combined process of active
and transfer learning boils down to a random search around an object, suitably
biased by prior experience, to identify promising grasps. In this paper we
present an active learning method for learning of grasps for given objects, and
a transfer learning method for learning of grasps for novel objects. Our
learning methods apply a kernel adaptive Metropolis-Hastings sampler that
learns an approximation of the grasps' probability density of an object while
drawing grasp proposals from it. The sampler employs simulated annealing to
search for globally-optimal grasps. Our empirical results show promising
applicability of our proposed learning schemes."
"While autonomous multirotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are uniquely well
suited for certain types of missions benefiting from stationary flight
capabilities, their more widespread usage still faces many hurdles, due in
particular to their limited range and the difficulty of fully automating their
deployment and retrieval. In this paper we address these issues by solving the
problem of the automated landing of a quadcopter on a ground vehicle moving at
relatively high speed. We present our system architecture, including the
structure of our Kalman filter for the estimation of the relative position and
velocity between the quadcopter and the landing pad, as well as our controller
design for the full rendezvous and landing maneuvers. The system is
experimentally validated by successfully landing in multiple trials a
commercial quadcopter on the roof of a car moving at speeds of up to 50 km/h."
"In various interaction tasks using Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems
(UVMSs) (e.g. sampling of the sea organisms, underwater welding), important
factors such as: i) uncertainties and complexity of UVMS dynamic model ii)
external disturbances (e.g. sea currents and waves) iii) imperfection and
noises of measuring sensors iv) steady state performance as well as v) inferior
overshoot of interaction force error, should be addressed during the force
control design. Motivated by the above factors, this paper presents a
model-free control protocol for force controlling of an Underwater Vehicle
Manipulator System which is in contact with a compliant environment, without
incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS's dynamic model, exogenous disturbances
and sensor's noise model. Moreover, the transient and steady state response as
well as reduction of overshooting force error are solely determined by certain
designer-specified performance functions and are fully decoupled by the UVMS's
dynamic model, the control gain selection, as well as the initial conditions.
Finally, a simulation study clarifies the proposed method and verifies its
efficiency."
"Collision-tolerant trajectory planning is the consideration that collisions,
if they are planned appropriately, enable more effective path planning for
robots capable of handling them. A mixed integer programming (MIP) optimization
formulation demonstrates the computational practicality of optimizing
trajectories that comprise planned collisions. A damage quantification function
is proposed, and the influence of damage functions constraints on the
trajectory are studied in simulation. Using a simple example, an increase in
performance is achieved under this schema as compared to collision-free optimal
trajectories."
"This paper describes the process and challenges behind the design and
development of a micro-gravity enabling aerial robot. The vehicle, designed to
provide at minimum 4 seconds of micro-gravity at an accuracy of .001 g's, is
designed with suggestions and constraints from both academia and industry as
well a regulatory agency. The feasibility of the flight mission is validated
using a simulation environment, where models obtained from system
identification of existing hardware are implemented to increase the fidelity of
the simulation. The current development of a physical test bed is described.
The vehicle employs both control and autonomy logic, which is developed in the
Simulink environment and executed in a Pixhawk flight control board."
"This paper investigates real-time control strategies for dynamical systems
that involve frictional contact interactions. Hybridness and underactuation are
key characteristics of these systems that complicate the design of feedback
controllers. In this research, we examine and test a novel feedback controller
design on a planar pushing system, where the purpose is to control the motion
of a sliding object on a flat surface using a point robotic pusher. The
pusher-slider is a simple dynamical system that retains many of the challenges
that are typical of robotic manipulation tasks.
  Our results show that a model predictive control approach used in tandem with
integer programming offers a powerful solution to capture the dynamic
constraints associated with the friction cone as well as the hybrid nature of
the contact. In order to achieve real-time control, simplifications are
proposed to speed up the integer program. The concept of Family of Modes (FOM)
is introduced to solve an online convex optimization problem by selecting a set
of contact mode schedules that spans a large set of dynamic behaviors that can
occur during the prediction horizon. The controller design is applied to
stabilize the motion of a sliding object about a nominal trajectory, and to
re-plan its trajectory in real-time to follow a moving target. We validate the
controller design through numerical simulations and experimental results on an
industrial ABB IRB 120 robotic arm."
"We present a possible method for integrating high level and low level
planning. To do so, we introduce the global plan random \emph{trajectory}
$\boldsymbol{\eta}_0 \colon [1,T] \to \mathbb R^2$, measured by goals $G_i$ and
governed by the distribution $p(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0 \mid \{ G_i\}_{i=1}^m)$.
This distribution is combined with the low level robot-crowd planner
$p(\mathbf{f}^{R},\mathbf{f}^{1},\ldots,\mathbf{f}^{n}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$
(from~\cite{trautmanicra2013, trautmaniros}) in the distribution
$p(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$. We
explore this \emph{integrated planning} formulation in three case studies, and
in the process find that this formulation 1) generalizes the ROS navigation
stack in a practically useful way 2) arbitrates between high and low level
decision making in a statistically sound manner when unanticipated local
disturbances arise and 3) enables the integration of an onboard operator
providing real time input at either the global (e.g., waypoint designation) or
local (e.g., joystick) level. Importantly, the integrated planning formulation
$p(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$
highlights failure modes of the ROS navigation stack (and thus for standard
hierarchical planning architectures); these failure modes are resolved by using
$p(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$.
Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how results from formal methods can
guide our factorization of
$p(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$."
"Precise trajectory tracking is a crucial property for \acp{MAV} to operate in
cluttered environment or under disturbances. In this paper we present a
detailed comparison between two state-of-the-art model-based control techniques
for \ac{MAV} trajectory tracking. A classical \ac{LMPC} is presented and
compared against a more advanced \ac{NMPC} that considers the full system
model. In a careful analysis we show the advantages and disadvantages of the
two implementations in terms of speed and tracking performance. This is
achieved by evaluating hovering performance, step response, and aggressive
trajectory tracking under nominal conditions and under external wind
disturbances."
"Shared control fuses operator inputs and autonomy inputs into a single
command. However, if environmental or operator predictions are multimodal,
state of the art approaches are suboptimal with respect to safety, efficiency,
and operator-autonomy agreement: even under mildly challenging conditions,
existing approaches can fuse two safe inputs into an unsafe shared control
[13]. Multi-modal conditions are common to many real world applications, such
as search and rescue robots navigating disaster zones, teleoperated robots
facing communication degradation, and assistive driving technologies. In [11,
13], we introduced a novel approach called generalized shared control (GSC)
that simultaneously optimizes autonomy objectives (e.g., safety and efficiency)
and operator-autonomy agreement under multimodal conditions; this optimality
prevents such unsafe shared control. In this paper, we describe those results
in more user friendly language by using illustrations and text."
"Scissor lifts, a staple of mechanical design, especially in competitive
robotics, are a type of linkage that can be used to raise a load to some
height, when acted upon by some force, usually exerted by an actuator. The
position of this actuator, however, can affect the mechanical advantage and
velocity ratio of the system. Hence, there needs to be a concrete way to
analytically compare different actuator positions. However, all current
research into the analysis of scissor lifts either focusses only on the screw
jack configuration, or derives separate force expressions for different
actuator positions. This, once again, leaves the decision between different
actuator positions to trial and error, since the expression to test the potency
of the position can only be derived once the position is chosen. This paper
proposes a derivation for a general force expression, in terms of a few
carefully chosen position variables, which can be used to generate the force
expression for any actuator position. Hence, this expression illustrates
exactly how each of the position variables (called a, b and i in this paper, as
defined later) affect the force output, and hence can be used to pick an
appropriate actuator position, by choosing values for the position variables
that give the desired result."
"This paper presents a novel filter with low computational demand to address
the problem of orientation estimation of a robotic platform. This is
conventionally addressed by extended Kalman filtering of measurements from a
sensor suit which mainly includes accelerometers, gyroscopes, and a digital
compass. Low cost robotic platforms demand simpler and computationally more
efficient methods to address this filtering problem. Hence nonlinear observers
with constant gains have emerged to assume this role. The nonlinear
complementary filter is a popular choice in this domain which does not require
covariance matrix propagation and associated computational overhead in its
filtering algorithm. However, the gain tuning procedure of the complementary
filter is not optimal, where it is often hand picked by trial and error. This
process is counter intuitive to system noise based tuning capability offered by
a stochastic filter like the Kalman filter. This paper proposes the right
invariant formulation of the complementary filter, which preserves Kalman like
system noise based gain tuning capability for the filter. The resulting filter
exhibits efficient operation in elementary embedded hardware, intuitive system
noise based gain tuning capability and accurate attitude estimation. The
performance of the filter is validated using numerical simulations and by
experimentally implementing the filter on an ARDrone 2.0 micro aerial vehicle
platform."
"This paper presents aims at mobility improvement of flexible underwater
robots. For this purpose, a novel propulsion method using planar structural
vibration pattern is proposed, and tested on two kinds of prototypes. The
result of experiments showed the possibility of the movements for multiple
directions: forward, backward, turn, rotation, drift, and their combination.
These movements are achieved by only one structure with two actuators. The
results also indicated the possibility of driving using eigenmodes since
movements were concentrated on low driving frequency area. To investigate the
relation between movement and structural vibration pattern, we established a
simulation model."
"With the development of state-of-art deep reinforcement learning, we can
efficiently tackle continuous control problems. But the deep reinforcement
learning method for continuous control is based on historical data, which would
make unpredicted decisions in unfamiliar scenarios. Combining deep
reinforcement learning and safety based control can get good performance for
self-driving and collision avoidance. In this passage, we use the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to implement autonomous driving without
vehicles around. The vehicle can learn the driving policy in a stable and
familiar environment, which is efficient and reliable. Then we use the
artificial potential field to design collision avoidance algorithm with
vehicles around. The path tracking method is also taken into consideration. The
combination of deep reinforcement learning and safety based control performs
well in most scenarios."
"We address one of the main challenges towards autonomous quadrotor flight in
complex environments, which is flight through narrow gaps. While previous works
relied on off-board localization systems or on accurate prior knowledge of the
gap position and orientation, we rely solely on onboard sensing and computing
and estimate the full state by fusing gap detection from a single onboard
camera with an IMU. This problem is challenging for two reasons: (i) the
quadrotor pose uncertainty with respect to the gap increases quadratically with
the distance from the gap; (ii) the quadrotor has to actively control its
orientation towards the gap to enable state estimation (i.e., active vision).
We solve this problem by generating a trajectory that considers geometric,
dynamic, and perception constraints: during the approach maneuver, the
quadrotor always faces the gap to allow state estimation, while respecting the
vehicle dynamics; during the traverse through the gap, the distance of the
quadrotor to the edges of the gap is maximized. Furthermore, we replan the
trajectory during its execution to cope with the varying uncertainty of the
state estimate. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate the proposed approach
in many real experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that addresses and achieves autonomous, aggressive flight through narrow gaps
using only onboard sensing and computing and without prior knowledge of the
pose of the gap."
"This paper describes a computational model, called the Dirichlet process
Gaussian mixture model with latent joints (DPGMM-LJ), that can find latent tree
structure embedded in data distribution in an unsupervised manner. By combining
DPGMM-LJ and a pre-existing body map formation method, we propose a method that
enables an agent having multi-link body structure to discover its kinematic
structure, i.e., body schema, from tactile information alone. The DPGMM-LJ is a
probabilistic model based on Bayesian nonparametrics and an extension of
Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). In a simulation experiment,
we used a simple fetus model that had five body parts and performed structured
random movements in a womb-like environment. It was shown that the method could
estimate the number of body parts and kinematic structures without any
pre-existing knowledge in many cases. Another experiment showed that the degree
of motor coordination in random movements affects the result of body schema
formation strongly. It is confirmed that the accuracy rate for body schema
estimation had the highest value 84.6% when the ratio of motor coordination was
0.9 in our setting. These results suggest that kinematic structure can be
estimated from tactile information obtained by a fetus moving randomly in a
womb without any visual information even though its accuracy was not so high.
They also suggest that a certain degree of motor coordination in random
movements and the sufficient dimension of state space that represents the body
map are important to estimate body schema correctly."
"Programming by demonstration (PbD) is an effective technique for developing
complex robot manipulation tasks, such as opening bottles or using human tools.
In order for such tasks to generalize to new scenes, the robot needs to be able
to perceive objects, object parts, or other task-relevant parts of the scene.
Previous work has relied on rigid, task-specific perception systems for this
purpose. This paper presents a flexible and open-ended perception system that
lets users specify perceptual ""landmarks"" during the demonstration, by
capturing parts of the point cloud from the demonstration scene. We present a
method for localizing landmarks in new scenes and experimentally evaluate this
method in a variety of settings. Then, we provide examples where user-specified
landmarks are used together with PbD on a PR2 robot to perform several complex
manipulation tasks. Finally, we present findings from a user evaluation of our
landmark specification interface demonstrating its feasibility as an end-user
tool."
"Magnetometer and inertial sensors are widely used for orientation estimation.
Magnetometer usage is often troublesome, as it is prone to be interfered by
onboard or ambient magnetic disturbance. The onboard soft-iron material
distorts not only the magnetic field, but the magnetometer sensor frame
coordinate and the cross-sensor misalignment relative to inertial sensors. It
is desirable to conveniently put magnetic and inertial sensors information in a
common frame. Existing methods either split the problem into successive
intrinsic and cross-sensor calibrations, or rely on stationary accelerometer
measurements which is infeasible in dynamic conditions. This paper formulates
the magnetometer calibration and alignment to inertial sensors as a state
estimation problem, and collectively solves the magnetometer intrinsic and
cross-sensor calibrations, as well as the gyroscope bias estimation. Sufficient
conditions are derived for the problem to be globally observable, even when no
accelerometer information is used at all. An extended Kalman filter is designed
to implement the state estimation and comprehensive test data results show the
superior performance of the proposed approach. It is immune to acceleration
disturbance and applicable potentially in any dynamic conditions."
"We propose a learning-from-demonstration approach for grounding actions from
expert data and an algorithm for using these actions to perform a task in new
environments. Our approach is based on an application of sampling-based motion
planning to search through the tree of discrete, high-level actions constructed
from a symbolic representation of a task. Recursive sampling-based planning is
used to explore the space of possible continuous-space instantiations of these
actions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a magnetic structure
assembly task, showing that the robot can intelligently select a sequence of
actions in different parts of the workspace and in the presence of obstacles.
This approach can better adapt to new environments by selecting the correct
high-level actions for the particular environment while taking human
preferences into account."
"Efficient robotic exploration of unknown, sensor limited,
global-information-deficient environments poses unique challenges to path
planning algorithms. In these difficult environments, no deterministic
guarantees on path completion and mission success can be made in general.
Integrated Exploration (IE), which strives to combine localization and
exploration, must be solved in order to create an autonomous robotic system
capable of long term operation in new and challenging environments. This paper
formulates a probabilistic framework which allows the creation of exploration
algorithms providing probabilistic guarantees of success. A novel connection is
made between the Hamiltonian Path Problem and exploration. The Guaranteed
Probabilistic Information Explorer (G-PIE) is developed for the IE problem,
providing a probabilistic guarantee on path completion, and asymptotic
optimality of exploration. A receding horizon formulation, dubbed RH-PIE, is
presented which addresses the exponential complexity present in G-PIE. Finally,
RH-PIE planner is verified via autonomous, hardware-in-the-loop experiments."
"Closed kinematic chains are created whenever multiple robot arms concurrently
manipulate a single object. The closed-chain constraint, when coupled with
robot joint limits, dramatically changes the connectivity of the configuration
space. We propose a regrasping move, termed ""IK-switch"", which allows
efficiently bridging components of the configuration space that are otherwise
mutually disconnected. This move, combined with several other developments,
such as a method to stabilize the manipulated object using the environment, a
new tree structure, and a compliant control scheme, enables us to address
complex closed-chain manipulation tasks, such as flipping a chair frame, which
is otherwise impossible to realize using existing multi-arm planning methods."
"Robot footstep planning strategies can be divided in two main approaches:
discrete searches and continuous optimizations. While discrete searches have
been broadly applied, continuous optimizations approaches have been restricted
for humanoid platforms. This article introduces a generalized
continuous-optimization approach for multilegged footstep planning which can be
adapted to different platforms, regardless the number and geometry of legs.
This approach leverages Mixed-Integer Convex Programming to account for the
non-convex constraints that represent footstep rotation and obstacle avoidance.
The planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem which considers
robot geometry and reachability with linear constraints, and can be efficiently
solved using optimization software. To demonstrate the functionality and
adaptability of the planner, a set of tests are performed on a BH3R hexapod and
a LittleDog quadruped on scenarios which can't be easily handled with discrete
searches, such tests are solved efficiently in fractions of a second. This work
represents, to the knowledge of the authors, the first successful
implementation of a continuous optimization-based multilegged footstep planner."
"We consider an autonomous navigation problem, whereby a traveler aims at
traversing an environment in which an adversary tries to set an ambush. A two
players zero sum game is introduced. Players' strategies are computed as random
path distributions, a realization of which is the path chosen by the traveler.
A parallel is drawn between the discrete problem, where the traveler moves on a
network, and the continuous problem, where the traveler moves in the plane.
Analytical optimal policies are derived. Using assumptions from the Minimal Cut
- Maximal Flow literature, the optimal value of the game is shown to be related
to the maximum flow on the environment in both the discrete and the continuous
cases, when the reward function for the ambusher is uniform. A linear program
is introduced that allows for the computation of optimal policies, compatible
with non-uniform reward functions. In order to relax the assumptions for the
computation of the players' optimal strategies of the continuous game, a
network is created, inspired by recently introduced sampling based motion
planning techniques, and the linear program is adapted for continuous
constraints."
"Autonomous delivery of goods using a MAV is a difficult problem, as it poses
high demand on the MAV's control, perception and manipulation capabilities.
This problem is especially challenging if the exact shape, location and
configuration of the objects are unknown. In this paper, we report our findings
during the development and evaluation of a fully integrated system that is
energy efficient and enables MAVs to pick up and deliver objects with partly
ferrous surface of varying shapes and weights. This is achieved by using a
novel combination of an electro-permanent magnetic gripper with a passively
compliant structure and integration with detection, control and servo
positioning algorithms. The system's ability to grasp stationary and moving
objects was tested, as well as its ability to cope with different shapes of the
object and external disturbances. We show that such a system can be
successfully deployed in scenarios where an object with partly ferrous parts
needs to be gripped and placed in a predetermined location."
"In this paper we study the following multi-robot coordination problem: given
a graph, where each edge is weighted by the probability of surviving while
traversing it, find a set of paths for $K$ robots that maximizes the expected
number of nodes collectively visited, subject to constraints on the probability
that each robot survives to its destination. We call this problem the Team
Surviving Orienteers (TSO) problem. The TSO problem is motivated by scenarios
where a team of robots must traverse a dangerous, uncertain environment, such
as aid delivery in disaster or war zones. We present the TSO problem formally
along with several variants, which represent ""survivability-aware"" counterparts
for a wide range of multi-robot coordination problems such as vehicle routing,
patrolling, and informative path planning. We propose an approximate greedy
approach for selecting paths, and prove that the value of its output is bounded
within a factor $1-e^{-p_s/\lambda}$ of the optimum where $p_s$ is the
per-robot survival probability threshold, and $1/\lambda \le 1$ is the
approximation factor of an oracle routine for the well-known orienteering
problem. Our approach has linear time complexity in the team size and
polynomial complexity in the graph size. Using numerical simulations, we verify
that our approach is close to the optimum in practice and that it scales to
problems with hundreds of nodes and tens of robots."
"We study the problem of planning paths for a team of robots for visually
monitoring an environment. Our work is motivated by surveillance and persistent
monitoring applications. We are given a set of target points in a polygonal
environment that must be monitored using robots with cameras. The goal is to
compute paths for all robots such that every target is visible from at least
one path. In its general form, this problem is NP-hard as it generalizes the
Art Gallery Problem and the Watchman Route Problem. We study two versions: (i)
a geometric version in \emph{street polygons} for which we give a polynomial
time $4$--approximation algorithm; and (ii) a general version for which we
present a practical solution that finds the optimal solution in possibly
exponential time. In addition to theoretical proofs, we also present results
from simulation studies."
"This paper proposes a visual-servoing method dedicated to grasping of
daily-life objects. In order to obtain an affordable solution, we use a
low-accurate robotic arm. Our method corrects errors by using an RGB-D sensor.
It is based on SURF invariant features which allows us to perform object
recognition at a high frame rate. We define regions of interest based on depth
segmentation, and we use them to speed-up the recognition and to improve
reliability. The system has been tested on a real-world scenario. In spite of
the lack of accuracy of all the components and the uncontrolled environment, it
grasps objects successfully on more than 95 percents of the trials."
"In this paper we present a novel distributed coverage control framework for a
network of mobile agents, in charge of covering a finite set of points of
interest (PoI), such as people in danger, geographically dispersed equipment or
environmental landmarks. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the C-Means, an
unsupervised learning algorithm originally proposed for non-exclusive
clustering and for identification of cluster centroids from a set of
observations. To cope with the agents' limited sensing range and avoid
infeasible coverage solutions, traditional C-Means needs to be enhanced with
proximity constraints, ensuring that each agent takes into account only
neighboring PoIs. The proposed coverage control framework provides useful
information concerning the ranking or importance of the different PoIs to the
agents, which can be exploited in further application-dependent data fusion
processes, patrolling, or disaster relief applications."
"In this paper, a novel process has been developed to realize high-level
complex cognitive behaviors into reactive agents, efficiently. This method
paves the way for deducting high-level reactive behaviors from low-level
perceptive information by autonomous robots. The aforementioned process lets us
actualize different generations of Braitenberg vehicles, are which able to
mimic desired behaviors to survive in complex environments with high degrees of
flexibility in perception and emergence of high-level cognitive actions. The
approach has been used to engineer a Braitenberg vehicle with a wide range of
perception-action capabilities. Verification would be realized within this
framework, due to the efficient traceability between each sequential pair of
process phases. The applied simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the
established development process, based on the Braitenberg vehicle's behavior."
"Two the most common tasks for autonomous mobile robots is to explore the
environment and locate a target. %In the last case, the objective is either to
find a target in the shortest time possible or, alternatively, to find %as many
targets as possible for a given amount of time. Targets could range from
sources of chemical contamination to people needing assistance in a disaster
area. From the very beginning, the quest for most efficient search algorithms
was strongly influenced by behavioral science and ecology, where researchers
try to figure out the strategies used by leaving beings, from bacteria to
mammals. Since then, bio-inspired random search algorithms remain one the most
important directions in autonomous robotics. Recently a new wave arrived
bringing a specific type of random walks as a universal search strategy
exploited by immune cells, insects, mussels, albatrosses, sharks, deers, and a
dozen of other animals including humans. These \textit{L\'{e}vy} walks combine
two key features, the ability of walkers to spread anomalously fast while
moving with a finite velocity. The latter is especially valuable in the context
of robotics because it respects the reality autonomous robots live in. There is
already an impressive body of publications on L\'{e}vy robotics; yet research
in this field is unfolding further, constantly bringing new results, ideas,
hypothesis and speculations. In this mini-review we survey the current state of
the field, list latest advances, discuss the prevailing trends, and outline
further perspectives."
"This paper reports on an algorithm for planning trajectories that allow a
multirotor micro aerial vehicle (MAV) to quickly identify a set of unknown
parameters. In many problems like self calibration or model parameter
identification some states are only observable under a specific motion. These
motions are often hard to find, especially for inexperienced users. Therefore,
we consider system model identification in an active setting, where the vehicle
autonomously decides what actions to take in order to quickly identify the
model. Our algorithm approximates the belief dynamics of the system around a
candidate trajectory using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It uses
sampling-based motion planning to explore the space of possible beliefs and
find a maximally informative trajectory within a user-defined budget. We
validate our method in simulation and on a real system showing the feasibility
and repeatability of the proposed approach. Our planner creates trajectories
which reduce model parameter convergence time and uncertainty by a factor of
four."
"This paper considers the problem of simultaneous 2-D room shape
reconstruction and self-localization without the requirement of any
pre-established infrastructure. A mobile device equipped with co-located
microphone and loudspeaker as well as internal motion sensors is used to emit
acoustic pulses and collect echoes reflected by the walls. Using only first
order echoes, room shape recovery and self-localization is feasible when
auxiliary information is obtained using motion sensors. In particular, it is
established that using echoes collected at three measurement locations and the
two distances between consecutive measurement points, unique localization and
mapping can be achieved provided that the three measurement points are not
collinear. Practical algorithms for room shape reconstruction and
self-localization in the presence of noise and higher order echoes are proposed
along with experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach."
"Dynamic Movement Primitives have successfully been used to realize imitation
learning, trial-and-error learning, reinforce- ment learning, movement
recognition and segmentation and control. Because of this they have become a
popular represen- tation for motor primitives. In this work, we showcase how
DMPs can be reformulated as a probabilistic linear dynamical system with
control inputs. Through this probabilistic repre- sentation of DMPs, algorithms
such as Kalman filtering and smoothing are directly applicable to perform
inference on pro- prioceptive sensor measurements during execution. We show
that inference in this probabilistic model automatically leads to a feedback
term to online modulate the execution of a DMP. Furthermore, we show how
inference allows us to measure the likelihood that we are successfully
executing a given motion primitive. In this context, we show initial results of
using the probabilistic model to detect execution failures on a simulated
movement primitive dataset."
"Attaining animal-like legged locomotion on rough outdoor terrain with sparse
foothold affordances -a primary use-case for legs vs other forms of locomotion-
is a largely open problem. New advancements in control and perception have
enabled bipeds to walk on flat and uneven indoor environments. But tasks that
require reliable contact with unstructured world surfaces, for example walking
on natural rocky terrain, need new perception and control algorithms.
  This thesis introduces 3D perception algorithms for contact tasks such as
foot placement in rough terrain environments. We introduce a new method to
identify and model potential contact areas between the robot's foot and a
surface using a set of bounded curved patches. We present a patch
parameterization model and an algorithm to fit and perceptually validate
patches to 3D point samples. Having defined the environment representation
using the patch model, we introduce a way to assemble patches into a spatial
map. This map represents a sparse set of local areas potentially appropriate
for contact between the robot and the surface. The process of creating such a
map includes sparse seed point sampling, neighborhood searching, as well as
patch fitting and validation. Various ways of sampling are introduced including
a real time bio-inspired system for finding patches statistically similar to
those that humans select while traversing rocky trails. These sparse patch
algorithms are integrated with a dense volumetric fusion of range data from a
moving depth camera, maintaining a dynamic patch map of relevant contact
surfaces around a robot in real time. We integrate and test the algorithms as
part of a real-time foothold perception system on a mini-biped robot,
performing foot placements on rocks."
"In this paper a search algorithm is proposed to find a sub optimal path for a
non-holonomic system. For this purpose the algorithm starts sampling the front
part of the vehicle and moves towards the destination with a cost function. The
bicycle model is used to define the non-holonomic system and a stability
analysis with different integration methods is performed on the dynamics of the
system. A proper integration method is chosen with a reasonably large step size
in order to decrease the computation time. When the tree is close enough to
destination the algorithm returns the path and in order to connect the tree to
destination point an optimal control problem using single shooting method is
defined. To test the algorithm different scenarios are tested and the
simulation results show the success of the algorithm."
"Miniature Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) are very suitable for flying in indoor
environments, but autonomous navigation is challenging due to their strict
hardware limitations. This paper presents a highly efficient computer vision
algorithm called Edge-FS for the determination of velocity and depth. It runs
at 20 Hz on a 4 g stereo camera with an embedded STM32F4 microprocessor (168
MHz, 192 kB) and uses feature histograms to calculate optical flow and stereo
disparity. The stereo-based distance estimates are used to scale the optical
flow in order to retrieve the drone's velocity. The velocity and depth
measurements are used for fully autonomous flight of a 40 g pocket drone only
relying on on-board sensors. The method allows the MAV to control its velocity
and avoid obstacles."
"In this paper we propose a new family of RRT based algorithms, named RRT+ ,
that are able to find faster solutions in high-dimensional configuration spaces
compared to other existing RRT variants by finding paths in lower dimensional
subspaces of the configuration space. The method can be easily applied to
complex hyper-redundant systems and can be adapted by other RRT based planners.
We introduce RRT+ and develop some variants, called PrioritizedRRT+ ,
PrioritizedRRT+-Connect, and PrioritizedBidirectionalT-RRT+ , that use the new
sampling technique and we show that our method provides faster results than the
corresponding original algorithms. Experiments using the state-of-the-art
planners available in OMPL show superior performance of RRT+ for
high-dimensional motion planning problems."
"Many important geometric estimation problems take the form of synchronization
over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given a
set of relative measurements between them. This problem is typically formulated
as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to
solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is
able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the
special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.
The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the
maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as
the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a
certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is
possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of
the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for
solving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank,
geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent
optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a
truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently.
Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding
procedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync
is able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available
measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than
that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and
does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based
approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques."
"The three bio-inspired strategies that have been used for balance recovery of
biped robots are the ankle, hip and stepping Strategies. However, there are
several cases for a biped robot where stepping is not possible, e. g. when the
available contact surfaces are limited. In this situation, the balance recovery
by modulating the angular momentum of the upper body (Hip-strategy) or the Zero
Moment Point (ZMP) (Ankle strategy) is essential. In this paper, a single Model
Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is employed for controlling the Capture Point
(CP) to a desired position by modulating both the ZMP and the Centroidal Moment
Pivot (CMP). The goal of the proposed controller is to control the CP,
employing the CMP when the CP is out of the support polygon, and/or the ZMP
when the CP is inside the support polygon. The proposed algorithm is
implemented on an abstract model of the SURENA III humanoid robot. Obtained
results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the presence of
severe pushes, even when the support polygon is shrunken to a point or a line."
"Currently grip control during in-hand manipulation is usually modeled as part
of a monolithic task, yielding complex controllers based on force control
specialized for their situations. Such non-modular and specialized control
approaches render the generalization of these controllers to new in-hand
manipulation tasks difficult. Clearly, a grip control approach that generalizes
well between several tasks would be preferable. We propose a modular approach
where each finger is controlled by an independent tactile grip controller.
Using signals from the human-inspired biotac sensor, we can predict future slip
- and prevent it by appropriate motor actions. This slip-preventing grip
controller is first developed and trained during a single-finger stabilization
task. Subsequently, we show that several independent slip-preventing grip
controllers can be employed together without any form of central communication.
The resulting approach works for two, three, four and five finger grip
stabilization control. Such a modular grip control approach has the potential
to generalize across a large variety of inhand manipulation tasks, including
grip change, finger gaiting, between-hands object transfer, and across multiple
objects."
"Within this paper, the problem of 3D structural inspection path planning for
distributed infrastructure using aerial robots that are subject to time
constraints is addressed. The proposed algorithm handles varying spatial
properties of the infrastructure facilities, accounts for their different
importance and exploration function and computes an overall inspection path of
high inspection reward while respecting the robot endurance or mission time
constraints as well as the vehicle dynamics and sensor limitations. To achieve
its goal, it employs an iterative, 3-step optimization strategy at each
iteration of which it first randomly samples a set of possible structures to
visit, subsequently solves the derived traveling salesman problem and computes
the travel costs, while finally it samples and assigns inspection times to each
structure and evaluates the total inspection reward. For the derivation of the
inspection paths per each independent facility, it interfaces a path planner
dedicated to the 3D coverage of single structures. The resulting algorithm
properties, computational performance and path quality are evaluated using
simulation studies as well as experimental test-cases employing a multirotor
micro aerial vehicle."
"Localization is a key requirement for mobile robot autonomy and human-robot
interaction. Vision-based localization is accurate and flexible, however, it
incurs a high computational burden which limits its application on many
resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we address the problem of
performing real-time localization in large-scale 3D point cloud maps of
ever-growing size. While most systems using multi-modal information reduce
localization time by employing side-channel information in a coarse manner (eg.
WiFi for a rough prior position estimate), we propose to inter-weave the map
with rich sensory data. This multi-modal approach achieves two key goals
simultaneously. First, it enables us to harness additional sensory data to
localise against a map covering a vast area in real-time; and secondly, it also
allows us to roughly localise devices which are not equipped with a camera. The
key to our approach is a localization policy based on a sequential Monte Carlo
estimator. The localiser uses this policy to attempt point-matching only in
nodes where it is likely to succeed, significantly increasing the efficiency of
the localization process. The proposed multi-modal localization system is
evaluated extensively in a large museum building. The results show that our
multi-modal approach not only increases the localization accuracy but
significantly reduces computational time."
"This technical report addresses the problem of optimal surveillance of the
route followed by a dynamic parade using a team of aerial robots. The dynamic
parade is considered to take place within an urban environment, it is
discretized and at every iteration, the algorithm computes the best possible
placing of the aerial robotic team members, subject to their camera model and
the occlusions arising from the environment. As the parade route is only as
well covered as its least-covered point, the optimization objective is to place
the aerial robots such that they maximize the minimum coverage over the points
in the route at every time instant of it. A set of simulation studies is used
to demonstrate the operation and performance characteristics of the approach,
while computational analysis is also provided and verifies the good scalability
properties of the contributed algorithm regarding the size of the aerial
robotics team."
"To participate in the Outback Medical Express UAV Challenge 2016, a vehicle
was designed and tested that can hover precisely, take-off and land vertically,
fly fast forward efficiently and use computer vision to locate a person and a
suitable landing location. A rotor blade was designed that can deliver
sufficient thrust in hover, while still being efficient in fast forward flight.
Energy measurements and windtunnel tests were performed. A rotor-head and
corresponding control algorithms were developed to allow transitioning flight
with the non-conventional rotor dynamics. Dedicated electronics were designed
that meet vehicle needs and regulations to allow safe flight beyond visual line
of sight. Vision based search and guidance algorithms were developed and
tested. Flight tests and a competition participation illustrate the
applicability of the DelftaCopter concept."
"In this paper, we study extensions to the Gaussian Processes (GPs) continuous
occupancy mapping problem. There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems
that we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under
pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map
inference. We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with
uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the
robot's perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach
allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the
possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed
techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy
mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into
account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by
modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the
map quality."
"In this paper, we propose a software abstraction layer to simplify the design
and synthesis of whole-body controllers without making any preliminary
assumptions on the control law to be implemented. The main advantage of the
proposed library is the decoupling of the control software from implementation
details, which are related to the robotic platform. Furthermore, the resulting
code is more clean and concise than ad-hoc code, as it focuses only on the
implementation of the control law. In addition, we present a reference
implementation of the abstraction layer together with a Simulink interface to
provide support to Model-Driven based development. We also show the
implementation of a simple proportional-derivative plus gravity compensation
control together with a more complex momentum-based bipedal balance controller."
"In many human-in-the-loop robotic applications such as robot-assisted surgery
and remote teleoperation, predicting the intended motion of the human operator
may be useful for successful implementation of shared control, guidance virtual
fixtures, and predictive control. Developing computational models of human
movements is a critical foundation for such motion prediction frameworks. With
this motivation, we present a computational framework for modeling reaching
movements in the presence of obstacles. We propose a stochastic optimal control
framework that consists of probabilistic collision avoidance constraints and a
cost function that trades-off between effort and end-state variance in the
presence of a signal-dependent noise. First, we present a series of
reformulations to convert the original non-linear and non-convex optimal
control into a parametric quadratic programming problem. We show that the
parameters can be tuned to model various collision avoidance strategies,
thereby capturing the quintessential variability associated with human motion.
Then, we present a simulation study that demonstrates the complex interaction
between avoidance strategies, control cost, and the probability of collision
avoidance. The proposed framework can benefit a variety of applications that
require teleoperation in cluttered spaces, including robot-assisted surgery. In
addition, it can also be viewed as a new optimizer which produces smooth and
probabilistically-safe trajectories under signal dependent noise."
"In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average
angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We
address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an
orientation framethat depends only on the current robot configuration and
provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the
language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the
flatness of the mechanical connection associated to the robotic system. Here,
however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result
accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody
dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still
providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature. This should help
spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric
mechanics,contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept
of average angular velocity."
"This paper presents the concept of an In situ Fabricator, a mobile robot
intended for on-site manufacturing, assembly and digital fabrication. We
present an overview of a prototype system, its capabilities, and highlight the
importance of high-performance control, estimation and planning algorithms for
achieving desired construction goals. Next, we detail on two architectural
application scenarios: first, building a full-size undulating brick wall, which
required a number of repositioning and autonomous localisation manoeuvres.
Second, the Mesh Mould concrete process, which shows that an In situ Fabricator
in combination with an innovative digital fabrication tool can be used to
enable completely novel building technologies. Subsequently, important
limitations and disadvantages of our approach are discussed. Based on that, we
identify the need for a new type of robotic actuator, which facilitates the
design of novel full-scale construction robots. We provide brief insight into
the development of this actuator and conclude the paper with an outlook on the
next-generation In situ Fabricator, which is currently under development."
"Cloud robotics is a field of robotics that attempts to invoke Cloud
technologies such as Cloud computing, Cloud storage, and other Internet
technologies centered around the benefits of converged infrastructure and
shared services for robotics. In a few short years, Cloud robotics as a newly
emerged field has already received much research and industrial attention. The
use of the Cloud for robotics and automation brings some potential benefits
largely ameliorating the performance of robotic systems. However, there are
also some challenges. First of all, from the viewpoint of architecture, how to
model and describe the architectures of Cloud robotic systems? How to manage
the variability of Cloud robotic systems? How to maximize the reuse of their
architectures? In this paper, we present an architecture approach to easily
design and understand Cloud robotic systems and manage their variability."
"This paper aims to implement Object-Oriented Markov Decision Process
(OO-MDPs) for goal planning and navigation of robot in an indoor environment.
We use the OO-MDP representation of the environment which is a natural way of
modeling the environment based on objects and their interactions. The paper
aims to extend the well known Taxi domain example which has been tested on grid
world environment to robotics domain with larger state-spaces. For the purpose
of this project we have created simulation of the environment and robot in ROS
with Gazebo and Rviz as visualization tools.The mobile robot uses a 2D LIDAR
module to perform SLAM in the unknown environment. The goal of this project is
to be able to make an autonomous agent capable of performing planning and
navigation in an indoor environment to deliver boxes (passengers in Taxi
domain) placed at random locations to a particular location (warehouse). The
approach can be extended to a wide variety of mobile and manipulative robots"
"With the increased application of model-based whole-body control methods in
legged robots, there has been an resurgence of interest in system
identification strategies and adaptive control. An important class of methods
relates to the identification of inertia parameters for rigid-body systems. For
each link, these consist of the mass, first mass moment (related to center of
mass location), and 3D rotational inertia tensor. The main contribution of this
paper is to formulate physical-consistency constraints on these parameters as
Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Matrix inequalities are found not in terms
of moments of inertia, but in terms of statistical moments, suggesting a
statistical perspective on the mass distribution of a rigid body. Through this
viewpoint, a rich set of new constraints can be formulated as LMIs that enforce
properties on the underlying mass distribution of each link. Overall, new
constraints have a simpler form, are more efficient to enforce in optimization,
and are tighter than those used in the current literature. The methods are
verified in system identification for a leg of the MIT Cheetah 3 robot.
Detailed properties of transmission components are identified alongside link
inertias, with parameter optimization carried out to guaranteed global
optimality through semidefinite programming."
"The goal of this paper is to create a new framework for dense SLAM that is
light enough for micro-robot systems based on depth camera and inertial sensor.
Feature-based and direct methods are two mainstreams in visual SLAM. Both
methods minimize photometric or reprojection error by iterative solutions,
which are computationally expensive. To overcome this problem, we propose a
non-iterative framework to reduce computational requirement. First, the
attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and axonometric projection are
utilized to decouple the 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) data, so that point clouds
can be matched in independent spaces respectively. Second, based on single
key-frame training, the matching process is carried out in frequency domain by
Fourier transformation, which provides a closed-form non-iterative solution. In
this manner, the time complexity is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(n \log{n})$, where
$n$ is the number of matched points in each frame. To the best of our
knowledge, this method is the first non-iterative and online trainable approach
for data association in visual SLAM. Compared with the state-of-the-arts, it
runs at a faster speed and obtains 3-D maps with higher resolution yet still
with comparable accuracy."
"We describe the grasping and manipulation strategy that we employed at the
autonomous track of the Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition at IROS
2016. A salient feature of our architecture is the tight coupling between
visual (Asus Xtion) and tactile perception (Robotic Materials), to reduce the
uncertainty in sensing and actuation. We demonstrate the importance of tactile
sensing and reactive control during the final stages of grasping using a Kinova
Robotic arm. The set of tools and algorithms for object grasping presented here

"Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are limited in their operation outdoors near
obstacles by their ability to withstand wind gusts. Currently widespread
position control methods such as Proportional Integral Derivative control do
not perform well under the influence of gusts. Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic
Inversion (INDI) is a sensor-based control technique that can control nonlinear
systems subject to disturbances. It was developed for the attitude control of
manned aircraft or MAVs. In this paper we generalize this method to the outer
loop control of MAVs under severe gust loads. Significant improvements over a
traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller are demonstrated
in an experiment where the quadrotor flies in and out of a windtunnel exhaust
at 10 m/s. The control method does not rely on frequent position updates, as is
demonstrated in an outside experiment using a standard GPS module. Finally, we
investigate the effect of using a linearization to calculate thrust vector
increments, compared to a nonlinear calculation. The method requires little
modeling and is computationally efficient."
"Robot Coverage Path planning (i.e., provide full coverage of a given domain
by one or multiple robots) is a classical problem in the field of robotics and
motion planning. The goal is to provide nearly full coverage while also
minimize duplicately visited area. In this paper we focus on the scenario of
path planning on general surfaces including planar domains with complex
topology, complex terrain or general surface in 3D space. The main idea is to
adopt a natural, intrinsic and global parametrization of the surface for robot
path planning, namely the holomorphic quadratic differentials. Except for a
small number of zero points (singularities), each point on the surface is given
a uv-coordinates naturally represented by a complex number. We show that
natural, efficient robot paths can be obtained by using such coordinate
systems. The method is based on intrinsic geometry and thus can be adapted to
general surface exploration in 3D."
"This paper discusses an innovative adaptive heterogeneous fusion algorithm
based on estimation of the mean square error of all variables used in real time
processing. The algorithm is designed for a fusion between derivative and
absolute sensors and is explained by the fusion of the 3-axial gyroscope,
3-axial accelerometer and 3-axial magnetometer into attitude and heading
estimation. Our algorithm has similar error performance in the steady state but
much faster dynamic response compared to the fixed-gain fusion algorithm. In
comparison with the extended Kalman filter the proposed algorithm converges
faster and takes less computational time. On the other hand, Kalman filter has
smaller mean square output error in a steady state but becomes unstable if the
estimated state changes too rapidly. Additionally, the noisy fusion deviation
can be used in the process of calibration. The paper proposes and explains a
real-time calibration method based on machine learning working in the online
mode during run-time. This allows compensation of sensor thermal drift right in
the sensors working environment without need of re-calibration in the
laboratory."
"In human-robot teams, humans often start with an inaccurate model of the
robot capabilities. As they interact with the robot, they infer the robot's
capabilities and partially adapt to the robot, i.e., they might change their
actions based on the observed outcomes and the robot's actions, without
replicating the robot's policy. We present a game-theoretic model of human
partial adaptation to the robot, where the human responds to the robot's
actions by maximizing a reward function that changes stochastically over time,
capturing the evolution of their expectations of the robot's capabilities. The
robot can then use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that
reveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the
information that the human currently has. We prove that under certain
observability assumptions, the optimal policy can be computed efficiently. We
demonstrate through a human subject experiment that the proposed model
significantly improves human-robot team performance, compared to policies that
assume complete adaptation of the human to the robot."
"Shared autonomy integrates user input with robot autonomy in order to control
a robot and help the user to complete a task. Our work aims to improve the
performance of such a human-robot team: the robot tries to guide the human
towards an effective strategy, sometimes against the human's own preference,
while still retaining his trust. We achieve this through a principled
human-robot mutual adaptation formalism. We integrate a bounded-memory
adaptation model of the human into a partially observable stochastic decision
model, which enables the robot to adapt to an adaptable human. When the human
is adaptable, the robot guides the human towards a good strategy, maybe unknown
to the human in advance. When the human is stubborn and not adaptable, the
robot complies with the human's preference in order to retain their trust. In
the shared autonomy setting, unlike many other common human-robot collaboration
settings, only the robot actions can change the physical state of the world,
and the human and robot goals are not fully observable. We address these
challenges and show in a human subject experiment that the proposed mutual
adaptation formalism improves human-robot team performance, while retaining a
high level of user trust in the robot, compared to the common approach of
having the robot strictly following participants' preference."
"This work addresses the problem of kinematic trajectory planning for mobile
manipulators with non-holonomic constraints, and holonomic operational-space
tracking constraints. We obtain whole-body trajectories and time-varying
kinematic feedback controllers by solving a Constrained Sequential Linear
Quadratic Optimal Control problem. The employed algorithm features high
efficiency through a continuous-time formulation that benefits from adaptive
step-size integrators and through linear complexity in the number of
integration steps. In a first application example, we solve kinematic
trajectory planning problems for a 26 DoF wheeled robot. In a second example,
we apply Constrained SLQ to a real-world mobile manipulator in a
receding-horizon optimal control fashion, where we obtain optimal controllers
and plans at rates up to 100 Hz."
"Torque control algorithms which consider robot dynamics and contact
constraints are important for creating dynamic behaviors for humanoids. As
computational power increases, algorithms tend to also increase in complexity.
However, it is not clear how much complexity is really required to create
controllers which exhibit good performance. In this paper, we study the
capabilities of a simple approach based on contact consistent LQR controllers
designed around key poses to control various tasks on a humanoid robot. We
present extensive experimental results on a hydraulic, torque controlled
humanoid performing balancing and stepping tasks. This feedback control
approach captures the necessary synergies between the DoFs of the robot to
guarantee good control performance. We show that for the considered tasks, it
is only necessary to re-linearize the dynamics of the robot at different
contact configurations and that increasing the number of LQR controllers along
desired trajectories does not improve performance. Our result suggest that very
simple controllers can yield good performance competitive with current state of
the art, but more complex, optimization-based whole-body controllers. A video

"Cloud Robotics is one of the emerging area of robotics. It has created a lot
of attention due to its direct practical implications on Robotics. In Cloud
Robotics, the concept of cloud computing is used to offload computational
extensive jobs of the robots to the cloud. Apart from this, additional
functionalities can also be offered on run to the robots on demand.
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the computational
intensive algorithm in robotics used by robots for navigation and map building
in an unknown environment. Several Cloud based frameworks are proposed
specifically to address the problem of SLAM, DAvinCi, Rapyuta and C2TAM are
some of those framework. In this paper, we presented a detailed review of all
these framework implementation for SLAM problem."
